    "### Analysis Plan\n",
    "1. **Chi-Square test**: Examining associations between the perceived barrier of \"being too busy\" and actual engagement metrics, such as time spent on social media, number of close relationships, and frequency of social activities. Determine whether there is correlation between each type of barrier and loneliness. We can cross-reference loneliness with those who agree with the questions posed and determine whether the number of variables they selected increases their perceived loneliness. Which categories correlate with higher loneliness, which have no impact?\n",

    "- **Self-Reporting Bias**: Self-reported perceptions of busyness or social anxiety may not fully reflect actual constraints.\n",

    "**Hypothesis**: Perceived busyness is more likely to be a subjective constraint than an actual limiter of social interaction. Perceived barriers by individuals differ from what they expect to be the biggest barriers to social interaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Results**: Individuals with perceived logistical barriers may still participate in online or asynchronous activities, suggesting flexible socialization options for busy individuals. Fear and anxiety variables may exhibit a strong negative association with in-person interactions, independent of logistical constraints. Income may play a more significant role in access to in-person social activities rather than in online engagements."

Variables help examine whether more frequent interactions are associated with lower loneliness levels and also determine how factors such as one's relationship with others impacts the effect of their interaction on their loneliness. \n",
