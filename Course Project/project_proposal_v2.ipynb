    "### Research Question 1\n",
    "What are the common barriers to social connection, and how do perceived barriers, such as \"being too busy,\" influence actual social interaction patterns? Is there a difference between perceived and actual barriers?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables of Interest\n",
    "- **Logistical Barriers**: (e.g., `CONNECTION_social_barriers_too_busy`) — To identify aspects of daily life affecting social connectivity, minimizing social desirability bias.\n",
    "- **Fear/Anxiety in Social Interactions**: (e.g., `CONNECTION_social_barriers_afraid`) — To evaluate psychological barriers as deterrents to in-person and online interactions.\n",
    "- **Income and Financial Barriers**: (e.g., `CONNECTION_social_barriers_money`) — To assess how income affects access to activities that improve loneliness.\n",
    "- **Perceived Busyness vs. Actual Engagement**: (`CONNECTION_social_barriers_too_busy`, `CONNECTION_social_media_time_per_day`, `CONNECTION_social_num_close_relationships`) — To determine if busyness is genuinely limiting or a perceived barrier, comparing engagement metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Planned Visualizations and Summary Statistics**:\n",
    "- **Frequency Distributions (bar plot)**: Track commonly selected barriers, identifying which are most impactful.\n",
    "- **Box/Violin Plots**: Compare loneliness scores across groups based on perceived barriers to identify links between perceived barriers and loneliness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis Plan\n",
    "1. **Chi-Square Test**: Examine associations between perceived busyness and actual engagement metrics (social media time, close relationships, social activities) to understand correlations between barriers and loneliness. Cross-reference loneliness with selected barriers to identify types correlating with higher loneliness.\n",
    "2. **Bootstrapping/t-tests**: Analyze differences in reported barriers across demographic subgroups (e.g., income levels, activity frequency) to explore potential disparities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions**:\n",
    "- **Self-Reporting Bias**: Participants’ perceptions of busyness or anxiety may not fully reflect actual constraints.\n",
    "- **Normality**: Certain hypothesis tests assume data normality, which may not hold for all barrier variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis and Expected Results\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: Perceived busyness is more subjective than an actual constraint on social interactions, and perceived barriers differ from actual obstacles to social connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Results**: Logistical barriers may still allow online or asynchronous activities, offering flexibility for busy individuals. Fear and anxiety are expected to negatively impact in-person interactions independently of logistical constraints. Financial barriers likely restrict access to in-person rather than online social activities."

    "### Research Question 2\n",
    "What social behaviors are exhibited by individuals experiencing loneliness, and how does perceived social support relate to loneliness? Additionally, how does the nature of one’s relationship with a lonely individual affect intervention effectiveness in reducing loneliness?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables of Interest\n",
    "- **Loneliness Indicators**: (e.g., `LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale`) — Direct measures of loneliness using tools like the UCLA Loneliness Scale, which provide insights into subjective loneliness levels.\n",
    "- **Social Interaction Frequency and Quality**: (e.g., `CONNECTION_social_num_close_friends`) — Analyzes the correlation between social interaction frequency and loneliness, exploring whether interaction types impact loneliness differently depending on relationship closeness.\n",
    "- **Perceived Social Support and Attachment Styles**: (e.g., `PSYCH_attachment_style_questionnaire`) — Examines the role of perceived support and attachment styles in mitigating or intensifying loneliness.\n",
    "- **Boredom and Social Phobias**: (e.g., `PSYCH_struk_short_boredom_proneness_scale`) — Assesses whether boredom and social anxiety are indicators of loneliness.\n",
    "- **Willingness to Reach Out and Help-Seeking Behavior**: (e.g., `CONNECTION_reached_out_*`) — Identifies which individuals seek social support and the barriers that may discourage them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Planned Visualizations and Summary Statistics**:\n",
    "- **Box Plots**: Show distributions of loneliness across attachment styles and help-seeking behaviors.\n",
    "- **Scatter Plots**: Examine relationships between meaningful interactions and loneliness levels.\n",
    "- **Bar Plots**: Illustrate frequency of specific social barriers and relationship types, distinguishing between relationship types (e.g., spouse vs. single).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis Plan\n",
    "1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarize loneliness, social media use, and interaction frequency to understand social behaviors among lonely individuals.\n",
    "2. **Correlation Analysis (Chi-Square, t-tests)**: Investigate correlations between loneliness and factors like social interaction frequency and perceived support.\n",
    "3. **Comparative Analysis by Subgroups**: Compare loneliness levels by attachment styles and help-seeking behaviors to see if these psychological factors influence loneliness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions**:\n",
    "- **Normality**: Continuous variables like loneliness scores are assumed to follow a normal distribution for statistical tests.\n",
    "- **Self-Reporting Bias**: Loneliness and social behaviors are subject to reporting bias, with potential over- or underreporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypotheses and Expected Results\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: Higher loneliness is expected to correlate with lower in-person interaction frequency and meaningful interactions, while higher perceived support and secure attachment styles are linked with lower loneliness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Results**: A significant negative correlation between in-person interactions and loneliness, with high social media use potentially indicating substitution for in-person interaction. Lower loneliness among those with high perceived support and secure attachments, suggesting the importance of secure relationships in reducing loneliness."

    "### Research Question 3\n",
    "How do family connections impact loneliness across different age groups, with variations based on age and parental status? Additionally, does family connection impact differ depending on whether individuals primarily connect with younger or older family members?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables of Interest\n",
    "- **Loneliness Across the Lifecourse**: (e.g., `LONELY_lifecourse_*`) — Measures loneliness across different life stages to observe age-related patterns and cross-referenced loneliness levels.\n",
