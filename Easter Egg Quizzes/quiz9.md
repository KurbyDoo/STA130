Question 10.25 pts
Last we left our intrepid heroes, the best battle in the history of battles was Marathon. 
But not because we love parameters and greek letters or VERY ATTRACTIVE Hollywood actors pretending to be 300 GreeksLinks to an external site., but because stats PhD Candidate and STA130 TUT210 TA Leo "Pain and Suffering" Murao Watson ran a 1:29:15Links to an external site. half marathon. And I saw it.

And 210 is the phone area code of where I'm from.
And no "Pain and Suffering" can't be right -- Leo was all smiles bouncin' like a bunny when I saw him.
So, no, the best battle in the history of battles was not any of the following, sorry.  

Beatbox and/or Battle Rap Battle
Brown Bottle Beetle Battle
Battle of the Bulge <-- potentially either a 300 reference as well, or maybe just a Jack Black shout out.
So this week you need to guess what my favorite REALLY BAD and at the same time totally awesome Hollywood movie is.
