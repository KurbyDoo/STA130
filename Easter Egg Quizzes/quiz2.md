Do you know how to do composite (multi-part) boolean selection using logical conditionals (with &, |, and ~) to select data? Can you use tuple, list, and dict object types appropriately? How about using a for loop based on a list or not based on a list using range(n) correctly with 0-based indexing?

Do you know what scipy.stats.multinomial and np.random.choice have in common (and what they don't), and what independence and conditional probability might (or might not) have to do with them?
