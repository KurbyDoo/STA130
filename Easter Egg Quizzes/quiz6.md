Can you name each element of the of following expressions, and explain why they are equivalent and what it would mean to put "hats" on the coefficient parameters?


Group of answer choices

Not yet, but I take it understanding something of the sort is in my future.

It's all greek to me!

The elements are Ytterbium, Barium, Xenon, Einsteinium, and Nobelium, but they are not equivalent because they have different atomic numbers.

If the hats are top hats it means the party is fancy, but if the hats are just baseball caps then it means it's just a normal party.

This one's different y'all: Week 07 Midway ChatBot Experience Reflection Survey

Just a straight up, "Tell us what you think about ChatBots, now"
chance to do exactly just what it says as advertised. 
Anonymous and not worth points, but appreciated as all hell as always.

P.S. I've also re-opened up the previous Week 05 ChatBot Experience Survey but AFTER the MIDTERM which asked for feedback regarding bootstrapping and p-values. I neglected to extend it when the homework deadline was pushed back, but then I thought I'd not bother you about it again so you could instead just prepare for the midterm exam without more interruption from me. But, if you wanted to provide feedback and previously couldn't, I'll leave this open for you now. Some hindsight on the midterm exam might even make your sense of the feedback you'd like to provide us more clear, and allow you to be very direct and pointed in telling us the feedback you have about the ChatBot aspect of the course at this point. Remember, the Week 05 ChatBot Experience Survey is one of the ones asking for 5-star scores for ChatBots in the course and asking which aspects of the course students think find helpful and useful for learning. If you already did the Week 05 ChatBot Experience Survey but want to do it again in order to give us updated responses and feedback after having taken the midterm exam you can do so.

Well, isn't this ironic, don't you think? A little too ironic. But, yeah, I really do think...

It's like rain on your wedding day; It's a free ride when you've already paid; It's the good advice that you just didn't take; Who would've thought... it figures
