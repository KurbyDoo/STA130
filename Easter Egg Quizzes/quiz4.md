Any chance you'd be willing to share some feedback for our Week 04 ChatBot Experience Survey?

Any and all feedback is welcome and greatly appreciated. 

This is just like the Week 02 survey, if you remember that, with the main focus being about accuracy and troubleshooting (as opposed to giving a 5-star review or indicating what resources or aspects of the course you're finding most helpful in the course). 

- Yay
- Neigh
- Good day, sir.
- I said, "Good Day"!
