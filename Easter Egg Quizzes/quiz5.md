What's the difference between the sampling distribution of a statistic under the null hypothesis VERSUS the bootstrapped sampling distribution of a statistic VERSUS variance?

Group of answer choices

The difference is trivially explained; furthermore, ask not of difference; rather, of similarity which binds


It's an Empirical question! Invade foreign lands! Boots on the ground! Long Live the Sampling Empire!! 


The difference is strictly academic and presents nuances and subtleties only dweebs could care about


I like samples at grocery stores... usually take two, thb, unless there's null left... then I'm sad. Real talk

I know this (and so I will avoid HELL and the wrath of Scott)


I don't yet know this (but I will so know soon in order to therefore avoid HELL and the wrath of Scott)


I don't know this, and that's okay. Come on, everyone -- CHARGE forward -- no one lives forever!


As a statistically anomalous Alpha with unimaginable strength, a p-value is when the relief is exceptionally satisfying, at which point I get totally hype and I null I'm not going to need to go again for at least another hour while I drink three Prime Energy drinks made by the only two people on early who are worthy of my respect, Paul Logan and KSI.

Week 05 ChatBot Experience Survey?

This one is the feedback form with the "5-star review" / "What resources or aspects of the course are you finding the most helpful?" questions... so, kinda the "more fun" one, perhaps. 

Any and all feedback is welcome and greatly appreciated. Honestly, we're KILLING it getting that feedback in. Our response rates ARE AMAZING. Thank you so much to everyone who's helping us out with this feedback. Any and all feedback is welcome and greatly appreciated.
