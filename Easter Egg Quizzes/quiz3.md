Might you be willing to provide some feedback to us for our Week 03 ChatBot Experience Survey?
Or course it's optional, anonymous, and all that. So no pressure. But it's basically just like the Week 02 optional survey, if you saw that. So hopefully your sense then was that it's not too much trouble to fill out, and you're up for doing so again! Or, perhaps you've not filled one of these out yet, but perhaps you now a have a little feedback to share, or maybe just wanna take a peek and see what these things are all about?

Indeed, the Week 03 optional survey has the exact same structure as the Week 02 optional survey; but, there's a slight difference in that this survey asks you to give your overall 5-start rating of the ChatBot, and to let us know what components of the course you're finding most helpful.
