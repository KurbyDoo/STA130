      "KATARA: Water. Earth. Fire. Air. My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days: a time of peace when the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation and Air Nomads. But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar mastered all four elements; only he could stop the ruthless firebenders. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years have passed, and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the war. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation, leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe. Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads and that the cycle is broken, but I haven't lost hope. I still believe that, somehow, the Avatar will return to save the world.\n",

      "SCENE DESCRIPTION: As the title card fades, the scene opens onto a shot of an icy sea before panning slowly to the left, revealing more towering icebergs drifting in the water as the shot rotates, moving over a large snow-covered area where the untouched blanket of snow is broken by two tracks of footsteps. The shot fades to another shot of the sea and of icebergs in blue water contrasted by the paleness of the sky beyond. As the shot once again pans to the left and rotates likewise, a small canoe comes into view, its motion through the water indicated by the wake left behind it. The shot zooms slightly on the canoe before cutting down to it, providing a side angle of the canoe and of the walls of ice rising on either side of the vessel. Two people, a boy and a girl, are sitting in the boat; the boy holds a spear at the ready, while the girl simply stares into the water on the other side of the boat. The shot cuts to an overhead view, revealing that a fish is swimming close to the surface right in front of the boy, who is focused on it, following its every movement. Cut to a frontal view of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "SOKKA: It's not getting away from me this time. [Close-up of the boy as he grins confidently over his shoulder in the direction of the girl.] Watch and learn, Katara. This is how you catch a fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "SCENE DESCRIPTION: The shot pans quickly from the boy to Katara, who seems indifferent to his claim and turns back to her side of the boat again. Her expression changes to surprise; as the shot jumps behind her, looking down into the water over her shoulder, another fish quickly swims by her, close to where she sits. She shoots a quick glance toward her brother, removing the glove from her left hand. She stretches her arm out in the direction of the fish, taking a deep breath. Her look is a mixture of concentration and apprehension as she starts making a wavy motion with her wrist, moving her hand up and down.\n",
      "The shot widens out; Sokka, still focused wholly on the fish in front of him, is completely unaware of what is happening behind his back. As Katara continues to move her hand, the water in front of Katara, just in front of the shot, starts to ripple. Suddenly, a bubble of water rises up from the ocean containing the newly trapped fish.\n",

      "KATARA: Water. Earth. Fire. Air. My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days: a time of peace when the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation and Air Nomads. But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar mastered all four elements; only he could stop the ruthless firebenders. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years have passed, and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the war. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation, leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe. Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads and that the cycle is broken, but I haven't lost hope. I still believe that, somehow, the Avatar will return to save the world. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As the title card fades, the scene opens onto a shot of an icy sea before panning slowly to the left, revealing more towering icebergs drifting in the water as the shot rotates, moving over a large snow-covered area where the untouched blanket of snow is broken by two tracks of footsteps. The shot fades to another shot of the sea and of icebergs in blue water contrasted by the paleness of the sky beyond. As the shot once again pans to the left and rotates likewise, a small canoe comes into view, its motion through the water indicated by the wake left behind it. The shot zooms slightly on the canoe before cutting down to it, providing a side angle of the canoe and of the walls of ice rising on either side of the vessel. Two people, a boy and a girl, are sitting in the boat; the boy holds a spear at the ready, while the girl simply stares into the water on the other side of the boat. The shot cuts to an overhead view, revealing that a fish is swimming close to the surface right in front of the boy, who is focused on it, following its every movement. Cut to a frontal view of him. \n",
      "SOKKA: It's not getting away from me this time. [Close-up of the boy as he grins confidently over his shoulder in the direction of the girl.] Watch and learn, Katara. This is how you catch a fish. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The shot pans quickly from the boy to Katara, who seems indifferent to his claim and turns back to her side of the boat again. Her expression changes to surprise; as the shot jumps behind her, looking down into the water over her shoulder, another fish quickly swims by her, close to where she sits. She shoots a quick glance toward her brother, removing the glove from her left hand. She stretches her arm out in the direction of the fish, taking a deep breath. Her look is a mixture of concentration and apprehension as she starts making a wavy motion with her wrist, moving her hand up and down.\n",
      "The shot widens out; Sokka, still focused wholly on the fish in front of him, is completely unaware of what is happening behind his back. As Katara continues to move her hand, the water in front of Katara, just in front of the shot, starts to ripple. Suddenly, a bubble of water rises up from the ocean containing the newly trapped fish. \n",
      "KATARA: [Happily surprised.] Sokka, look! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Close-up of Sokka; whispering.] Sshh! Katara, you're going to scare it away. [A look of bliss adorns his face. He licks his lips and wiggles his fingers, not taking his eyes off the fish.] Mmmm ... I can already smell it cookin'. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Behind Sokka, Katara is still making circular movements with both her arms, suspending the bubble of water that holds the fish in the air and moving back and forth. The camera cuts to her face, contorted slightly by the focus it takes to control the water. \n",
      "KATARA: [Struggling with the water that passes right in front of her.] But, Sokka! I caught one! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The bubble containing her fish slowly drifts around her to hang over Sokka, who is still oblivious. As the bubble hovers over his head, Sokka raises his spear to strike the fish he was following. He bursts the bubble of water with the blunt end of his weapon, causing Katara to lose control of the water; it rains down on Sokka, soaking him. \n",
      "KATARA: [Exclaims indignantly.] Hey! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As Sokka lets out a gasp of discomfort, the fish tumbles through the air and Katara follows its arc with her eyes as it flies over her head and splashes back into the sea. Sokka rounds on his sister, placing his spear perpendicular to the rim of the boat as he yells irately. The shot cuts to a close-up of him. \n",
      "SOKKA: Why is it that every time you play with magic water, I get soaked? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka clenches his fists and a few drops of water fall from his soaked gloves. \n",
      "KATARA: [Cut to her face; she sighs lightly before answering in slight annoyance.] It's not \"magic\", it's waterbending! And it's ... \n",
      "SOKKA: Yeah, yeah, \"an ancient art unique to our culture\", blah, blah, blah. Look, I'm just saying [Grabbing his warrior's wolf knot with his left hand as he turns away from her, wringing the water out of it. Meanwhile, Katara has crossed her arms.] that if I had weird powers, I'd keep my weirdness to myself. \n",
      "KATARA: [Cut to her face as she raises an eyebrow skeptically, arms still crossed.] You're calling me weird? I'm not the one who makes muscles at myself every time I see my reflection in the water! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Near the end of her response, Katara smiles smugly at her brother; as the shot cuts to him, he is flexing at his reflection in the water and grinning confidently. His happy look vanishes upon hearing his sister's remark and he turns around slowly, meaning to face her. Before he can say anything, however, the canoe suddenly shudders. As they both try to keep from falling over, Sokka whirls around toward his end of the canoe, a frantic look on his face.\n",
      "The camera cuts to a far view of the canoe, which pans up as the boat moves away from it. The boat is caught in a rapid current, which is pulling it swiftly toward a jumble of large icebergs which block the end of the narrow passage formed by the towering walls of ice. Sokka paddles the boat in an attempt to stay clear of any floating chunks of ice. He manages to gain just enough speed to keep the boat from being crushed by two icebergs which slam together behind the boat. A series of shots follows: the canoe moving through the water as Sokka rows furiously; a close-up of Sokka's head; and a frontal shot of the canoe as it is nearly pinned by a number of smaller chunks of ice. Cut to Katara's face, both her face and voice full of panic as she yells commands to Sokka. \n",
      "KATARA: Watch out! Go left! Go left! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The shot shows an overview of the ice floes moving closer together in front of the boat, narrowing their path. The boat manages to stay clear of some of the icebergs, but it veers to the right with the current and becomes pinned by three large chunks of ice. As the canoe is completely crushed by the ice, Katara and Sokka throw themselves from the canoe and onto one of the floes; Katara nearly slides off the other side into the water, but comes to a halt at the floe's very edge. As she raises her head, looking around, the shot zooms out to reveal the siblings are floating on one floe among dozens.\n",
      "Katara, shuffling on her hands and knees, moves away from the rim toward the middle of the floe, sitting next to her brother. His spear is embedded point-first in the ice just behind him. \n",
      "KATARA: [A touch of bitterness in her voice.] You call that left? \n",
      "SOKKA: You don't like my steering? Well, maybe you should've [He waves his hands, mockingly imitating waterbending.] waterbended us out of the ice. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The shot cuts to a wide shot of the two on their floe; among the large icebergs and tiny floes surrounding them stands a massive, towering shard of ice, its craggy peak rising high above the siblings. Katara gets on her feet again, facing Sokka so that the pointed iceberg is behind her. \n",
      "KATARA: [Indignantly.] So it's my fault? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Annoyed.] I knew I should've left you home! [Cut to a close-up of the siblings; Katara is staring down at her brother in anger while he rants calmly.] Leave it to a girl to screw things up! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a close-up of Katara's face as it contorts with fury. The shot cuts to a side view as Katara points accusingly at her brother, who makes no movement as she screams her disgust at him, the floe bobbing lightly up and down. \n",
      "KATARA: You are the most sexist, [She brings her hands up to her head and swings them back down and behind her in her rage; the movement creates a small wave of water behind her.] immature, [Hands raised back to her head.] nut brained ... [Swings her arms back down again, creating a slightly larger wave; she raises her hands back to her head during a brief loss for words.] I'm embarrassed [Throwing a hand upward, a short jet of water shoots upward as well.] to be related to you! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She swings both her hands back forcefully once again and her unconscious waterbending hurls a wave directly into the towering iceberg behind her; with a loud, splitting crack, a hooklike fissure arcs up its surface and out its side, leaving a spray of ice where it ends. Sokka, who wears a somewhat disinterested expression, glances briefly in his sister's direction and sees the iceberg; after a short moment, he does a double-take, his expression morphing into one of terror. The shot cuts to show Katara's outburst from behind Sokka; as she continues with her verbal outburst and arm movements, little chunks of ice from the iceberg splash into the water, unheard and unnoticed by Katara. \n",
      "KATARA: Ever since mom died, [Points to herself.] I've been doing all the work around camp while you've been off playing soldier! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She emphasizes the last words with a strong swing of her hand, waterbending and deepening the crack in the iceberg. Sokka's terror deepens. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Pointing to the iceberg behind her, his voice subdued by fright.] Uh ... Katara ... \n",
      "KATARA: [Close-up of a rage-fueled Katara as she continues her outburst, a finger pointed in Sokka's face.] I even wash all the clothes! Have you ever smelled your dirty socks? Let me tell you, not pleasant! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As she yells out that last word, she unconsciously waterbends once again, causing two new splits in the chunk of ice. \n",
      "SOKKA: [In a screeching voice, his eyes open wide in fear.] Katara, settle down! \n",
      "KATARA: No that's it! I'm done helping you! From now on, you're on your own! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Her last movement is her most agitated and it creates a huge wave which, when it impacts the  iceberg, sends a number of fissures to snake their way up the iceberg; one of them reaches the top of the iceberg, splitting it completely in half. Petrified, Sokka gasps for air, and it is only now that Katara turns to look behind her. She gasps and the shot cuts to the iceberg; the two halves begin to fall away from each other and the siblings can be seen through the widening space between them. The shot jumps to the siblings' backs as the two halves collapse into the water; a wave larger than any Katara cast at it radiates outward toward them and they are thrown to the ice as it pushes their floe backward.\n",
      "As the waves subside, the shot cuts to a head-on close-up of the siblings, their heads slightly over the edge of the ice. Sokka, holding a protective arm over Katara, turns his head toward her. \n",
      "SOKKA: Okay, you've gone from \"weird\" to \"freakish\", [He releases her.] Katara. \n",
      "KATARA: [Astonished.] You mean I did that? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sarcastically, glancing at her and smirking.] Yep. [Nudging her with his elbow.] Congratulations. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Several small bubbles appear on the surface of the water directly in front of them and a small spot of water begins to glow with a bright bluish hue. An overhead shot shows the spread of the brilliant glow and the bubbles within. Cut to the head-on close-up as the two siblings scramble back in renewed terror from the edge, just as a large, roughly spherical iceberg breaks the surface of the water.\n",
      "The shot jumps behind Katara and Sokka as an iceberg rises above the surface, revealing its massive form to be the source of the glow. The crashing waves generated by the iceberg's rising push the floe backward as the berg itself rocks to one side, before coming to rest with its rounded dome exposed above the water. Mesmerized by the iceberg, Katara strays closer and stares at the iceberg; behind her, Sokka halfheartedly stretches out his hand, as if to hold her back. A few cuts ensue: the iceberg from behind Sokka and Katara; Katara's face as she stares at the object; and a shot of the iceberg itself, revealing a human shape within below a larger, indistinguishable mass. The human figure, perched in lotus, has glowing arrows on its head and hands. Close-up of Katara as she raises an eyebrow in confusion. The shot cuts to a closer view of the figure in the ice, its features accentuated by reflected light, revealing it to be a boy. Suddenly, the boy opens his eyes, the same brilliant light emanating from them, eliciting shocked gasps from both of the siblings. \n",
      "KATARA: He's alive! We have to help! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Before Sokka can grab it, Katara grabs Sokka's club out of its sheath on his back and pulls her hood over her head, heading in the direction of the strange boy sealed in the iceberg. Sokka again reaches out his hand in an attempt to hold Katara back, though she is already running across the ice. \n",
      "SOKKA: Katara, get back here! [He grabs his spear from the ice and runs after Katara, who is already at the ice's edge.] We don't know what that thing is! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara hops across the short distance between her floe and the iceberg on five tiny chinks of ice; Sokka, close behind her, does the same. Reaching the iceberg first, Katara repeatedly strikes the iceberg with Sokka's club. On her fifth strike, the club breaks through the surface and a great gust of wind, which escapes from within the iceberg, throws her and her brother back from the side of the dome. Fissures quickly snake their way over the whole iceberg and, in a massive outward explosion, the entire orb of ice destroys itself. A beam of light bursts from the core of the iceberg and rockets into the sky. The camera shows the iceberg from the shallow sea bottom as it emits ripples of light. The scene switches to a group of tiger seals, who erect themselves to growl at the distant beam of light.\n",
      "Cut to a Fire Nation ship, where a boy in a Fire Nation military uniform stands on the deck, gazing at the light. His ponytail flutters in the wind. \n",
      "ZUKO: Finally! [He turns around to face another person in uniform, who sits at a small table.] Uncle, do you realize what this means?! \n",
      "IROH: [The man is playing some sort of card game. He answers calmly while looking over the tile he's holding toward his nephew.] I won't get to finish my game? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Turning around again to face the light.] It means my search is about to come to an end. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Iroh sighs uninterestedly and places his tile on the table. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Gestures at the light while facing his uncle again.] That light came from an incredibly powerful source! [The light dwindles and disappears.] It has to be him! \n",
      "IROH: [With continuing disinterest and an air of skepticism.] Or it's just the celestial lights. We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko. [He looks at the tile in his hand, depicting the symbol of airbending.] I don't want you to get too excited over nothing. [He places it on a tile carrying the symbol of firebending and gestures toward the open place at the other side of the table while continuing in a relaxed voice.] Please, sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming Jasmine tea? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Furiously, still facing Iroh.] I don't need any calming tea! I need to capture the Avatar! Helmsman, head a course for the light! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko points in the direction of where the light once was. Iroh calmly continues with his game, placing another tile bearing the airbending symbol on the previous one. As he does, a gust of wind washes over him, shaking his tiles.\n",
      "Cut to the iceberg, where the gale has begun to settle. Sokka had protectively clutched Katara, but he now releases her as he looks around. Light still encircles the remains of the former mountain of ice, now reduced to a hollowed-out crater. Sokka looks at his sister and they both get to their feet, Katara holding onto her brother. He points his spear at the crater, ready to defend them, though lowers it in shock as a figure emerges slowly from the depression in the iceberg. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Brandishing his spear in defense once again.] Stop! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Now standing atop the crater, the figure slowly erects himself and looks down at them, and the two siblings stare back in wonder and fear.\n",
      "The circles of light finally dissipate as the boy stops glowing. The figure is revealed to be nothing more than a young boy, who gives a moan of exhaustion and suddenly faints. Katara gasps and runs forward to catch him before he hits the ground and Sokka begins to poke at the boy's head with the blunt end of his spear. \n",
      "KATARA: [Waves the spear away. Annoyed.] Stop it! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara places the boy gently against the base of the crater. Close-up of the boy as he slowly opens his gray eyes. He gasps in awe as he beholds the Southern Water Tribe girl, who stares at him, in relief, with deep blue eyes. Her hair loopies sway in the wind. \n",
      "AANG: [In a weak voice.] I need to ask you something ... \n",
      "KATARA: What? \n",
      "AANG: Please ... come closer. \n",
      "KATARA: [Curiously.] What is it? \n",
      "AANG: [In a clear, happy, hopeful tone.] Will you go penguin sledding with me? \n",
      "KATARA: [Awkwardly.] Uh, sure ... I-I guess. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera moves back again to show the threesome at the base of the iceberg. The boy elegantly rises to his feet in one swift motion, surprising the other two. Katara looks at him in awe while Sokka backs away in shock, aiming his spear at him again. Katara glances at him in disbelief. \n",
      "AANG: [Looking around and rubbing his head, while Katara scrambles on her feet.] What's going on here? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Aggressively.] You tell us! [Points at the top of the crater.] How did you get in the ice? And why aren't you frozen? [He pokes the boy in his side with his spear.] \n",
      "AANG: [Lazily pushes the spear away.] I'm ... not sure. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A low, gruff noise suddenly fills the air, coming from within the crater of the iceberg. Quickly, the boy scrambles up the ridge of ice and happily jumps on the head of a large, furry creature that has the same arrow-shaped marking on his forehead as the boy. \n",
      "AANG: [Exclaims happily.] Appa! Are you all right? [He hangs down the side of the beast to look at its eyes, which are still closed.] Wake up, buddy. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He opens an eyelid that immediately closes again once it is released. He jumps down to the front of the bison and tries to lift its enormous head. Sokka and Katara appear around the corner as Appa finally starts to react to Aang, opening his mouth and licking Aang with his giant tongue. Sokka's jaw drops upon seeing the beast. \n",
      "AANG: [Laughing cheerfully.] Ha, ha! You're okay! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang hugs the bison's nose. The camera moves back to reveal that the creature stands up on his six legs and stretches itself. When the picture moves closer again, Aang is petting the bison's nose. \n",
      "SOKKA: What is that thing? \n",
      "AANG: This is Appa, my flying bison. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sarcastically.] Right, and this is Katara, my flying sister. [Katara shoots him an odd look.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang looks questioningly at Sokka for a moment, but his attention is diverted back toward his bison when Appa starts to inhale deeply. Realizing what is about to happen, Aang ducks before Appa sneezes, sending a large blast of green flying directly onto Sokka, who becomes completely covered in it. He squeals in disgust and begins to frantically try clean it off, rubbing his face in the snow under the amused gaze of his sister. \n",
      "AANG: [Cheerfully.] Don't worry, it'll wash out. [Green slime is hanging from Sokka's face to his glove, dripping down as he retracts his hand. Katara covers her mouth in disgust.] So do you guys live around here? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Pointing his spear accusingly again at Aang who is surprised to see the thing.] Don't answer that! Did you see that crazy bolt of light?! He was probably trying to signal the Fire Navy! \n",
      "KATARA: [Pushes Sokka's spear away again and addresses him sarcastically.] Oh yeah, I'm sure he's a spy for the Fire Navy. You can tell by that evil look in his eye. [Aang shoots the two an earnest grin.] The paranoid one is my brother, Sokka. You never told us your name. \n",
      "AANG: I'm A ... a-a-a-Achoo! [The boy sneezes, creating an air blast that sends him soaring into the air. He lands on the ground, unharmed.] I'm Aang. [He sniffles a bit.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Total disbelief.] You just sneezed ... [Points to the sky.] and flew ten feet in the air! \n",
      "AANG: [He looks questioningly toward the sky.] Really? It felt higher than that. \n",
      "KATARA: [Gasps for air in comprehension.] You're an airbender! \n",
      "AANG: Sure am! \n",
      "SOKKA: Giant light beams, flying bison, airbenders ... [Walks away.] I think I got midnight sun madness. I'm going home to where stuff makes sense. [He realizes, however, that he is stranded in the middle of the ocean with no way home.] \n",
      "AANG: Well, if you guys are stuck, Appa and I can give you a lift. [Aang airbends himself onto Appa.] \n",
      "KATARA: We'd love a ride! Thanks! [Katara runs to the side of the bison.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Oh no! I'm not getting on that fluffy snot monster! \n",
      "KATARA: [While climbing on top of Appa with the help of Aang.] Are you hoping some other kind of monster will come along and give you a ride home? You know, before you freeze to death? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka opens his mouth in defiance and point at Katara, ready to retaliate, but he cannot think of anything. He sighs and bows his head in consent and defeat.\n",
      "The camera switches to a shot where both siblings are sitting on Appa's saddle. Sokka has his arms crossed in front of him with a sulking expression on his face while Katara is full of excitement and anticipation. \n",
      "AANG: Okay, first time flyers, hold on tight! Appa, yip-yip! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang whips the reins and Appa growls in response. He moves his tail up and down and takes a huge jump into the air. He soars through the air for mere few seconds, making it appear as though he would fly, before belly-flopping into the water with a splash. The bison begins trudging through the water slowly. Katara crawls to the front of the saddle while Aang tries to get Appa flying, whipping the reins again. \n",
      "AANG: Come on, Appa. Yip-yip! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sarcastically.] Wow, that was truly amazing ... \n",
      "AANG: [Katara shoots her brother an angry glance.] Appa's just a little tired. A little rest and he'll be soaring through the sky. You'll see. [Katara smiles at Aang, who returns this gesture. When she wants to move back, she realizes that he is still smiling at her.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Uncomfortably.] Why are you smiling at me like that? \n",
      "AANG: Oh, I was smiling? [Surprised, Katara smiles back.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka throws his head back and sticks his tongue out in disgust while groaning loudly. Katara glares at him while Appa continues to make his way through the icy sea, flapping his tail in the water.\n",
      "The picture tilts up and fades away to reveal Zuko standing on the helm of his ship, staring into the distance. The young man is approached by his uncle. \n",
      "IROH: I'm going to bed now. [Yawns and stretches.] Yep, a man needs his rest. [After a short pause, he abandons his try at a veiled suggestion and delivers his request more clearly, his tone tired.] Prince Zuko, you need some sleep. Even if you're right, and the Avatar is alive, you won't find him. Your father, grandfather and great-grandfather all tried and failed. \n",
      "ZUKO: Because their honor didn't hinge on the Avatar's capture. Mine does. This coward's hundred years in hiding are over. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene fades to Appa who is still swimming in the water. Aang now lies lazily on his back, his arms tucked under his head. Katara crawls to the front of the saddle again to have a better look at the boy. She leans on the front of the saddle and rests her head on her arm. \n",
      "KATARA: Hey. \n",
      "AANG: Hey. What'cha thinkin' about? \n",
      "KATARA: I guess I was wondering, your being an airbender and all, if you had any idea what happened to the Avatar? \n",
      "AANG: Oh, no. I didn't know him. I mean, I knew people that knew him, but I didn't. Sorry. [He smiles weakly at Katara.] \n",
      "KATARA: Okay. Just curious. [She slants her eyes in disappointment for a second before smiling again at Aang.] Good night. \n",
      "AANG: Sleep tight. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang uncomfortably turns around and a look of guilt crosses his face. The camera switches to another wide shot of Appa swimming through the vast sea, reflecting the brilliant sunlight.\n",
      "The scene switches to a dream of Aang's, colored in various shades of gray. Aang is sleeping on Appa's saddle while clouds build around and ahead of him. Lightning splits the sky and the rumble of the following thunder awakens him. He shoots up and looks around. In the next shot it is raining and Aang is sitting on Appa's head again, holding the reigns and screaming at the top of his lungs in terror while they go down. Appa and Aang splash into the waters of the ocean. Appa resurfaces again, growls, but is quickly subdued anew by another wave. Both Aang and Appa sink unconscious into the water. As Aang releases the reigns and drifts off, his eyes and tattoos suddenly start to glow brightly. He slams his fists together, creating a bluish-white sphere that encases Appa and himself. As the air sphere slowly solidifies into an icy globe, a voice permeates the dream. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang? Aang! Wake up. [Aang shoots up, throwing the covers of his body and gasping for air. Katara perches beside him and stands up as she sees that Aang is awake.] It's okay, we're in the village now! Come on, get ready. [She points to the door of the tent.] Everyone's waiting to meet you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang happily gets out of bed and starts to dress himself while Katara takes a step toward the door. Before she exits, however, she glances back at Aang and gasps, staring in wonder at the blue, arrow-shaped tattoos that trace his arms and legs and reach up his back and to his head. Before Aang is able to get up, Katara pulls him along by his arm to meet the rest of the village.\n",
      "Aang is dragged out the tent toward a small congregation of villagers. He passes Sokka, who is sitting at the side of the tent, sharpening his boomerang. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, this is the entire village. [Points to the line of villagers in front of them.] Entire village, Aang. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang bows respectfully toward the villages, but they cower away in fear, bringing a surprised look to Katara and Aang's faces. Sokka just watches from a distance. \n",
      "AANG: [Uncomfortably.] Uh, why are they all looking at me like that? Did Appa sneeze on me? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang checks his clothing while an elderly woman steps forward out of the line of villagers. \n",
      "KANNA: Well, no one has seen an airbender in a hundred years. We thought they were extinct, until my granddaughter and grandson found you. \n",
      "AANG: [Shocked disbelief.] Extinct? \n",
      "KATARA: [Gesturing.] Aang, this is my grandmother. \n",
      "KANNA: Call me Gran-Gran. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka walks toward Aang and abruptly snatches his staff out of his hands and starts to examine it. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Annoyed.] What is this, a weapon? You can't stab anything with this! \n",
      "AANG: [Aang uses a small air current to get his staff back.] It's not for stabbing! It's for airbending. [He opens his staff into a glider, making Sokka gasp in fright and cover his head with his hands.] \n",
      "VILLAGE.GIRL: [Excited.] Magic trick! Do it again! \n",
      "AANG: Not magic, airbending. [He moves his glider around him, visually demonstrating what he is talking about.] It lets me control the air currents around my glider and fly. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Mockingly states his disbelief.] Ya know, last time I checked, humans can't fly! \n",
      "AANG: [Accepting Sokka's challenge, smiling.] Check again! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang grabs hold of his glider and pushes himself off the ground, leaving Katara and Sokka to cover their faces against the sudden wind. The village stares in awe as Aang makes some loops and turns in the sky. \n",
      "VILLAGE.GIRL: [In admiration.] He's flying! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang makes another loops and speeds up to soar past the gazing villagers. \n",
      "VILLAGE.GIRL: It's amazing! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang's shadow passes over Katara, who is smiling broadly at him. Aang, intending to further impress the villagers, flies sideways and closes his eyes while grinning broadly. He promptly flies head-on into the village's watchtower, causing his head to be stuck in its side. Katara covers her mouth as she watches Aang struggle to extricate his head from the icy watchtower. Succeeding, he tumbles downward onto a pile of snow at the base of the tower that crumbled from the building. Katara immediately rushes to his side while Sokka stares in shock at the damage inflicted on his watchtower. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Shocked.] My watchtower! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang lies covered in snow at the base of the partially collapsed tower. Katara and some other girls of the tribe run toward Aang, smiling. \n",
      "KATARA: [Offering her hand to pull him out of the snow.] That was amazing! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka runs toward his watchtower and starts to pat it in the hope that he can save it from collapsing any further. While Aang spins his staff around to retract its wings, Sokka is being knocked down by a large pack of snow that falls down. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Annoyed.] Great. You're an airbender, Katara's a waterbender. Together you can just waste time all day long. [He wedges himself free from underneath the weight of the snow and stalks off.] \n",
      "AANG: [Surprised and with admiration.] You're a waterbender? \n",
      "KATARA: [Nervously.] Well, sort of. Not yet. \n",
      "KANNA: All right, no more playing. Come on, Katara, you have chores. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Kanna leads Katara away from Aang. The surrounding villagers part to let the duo pass. \n",
      "KATARA: [Excitedly.] I told you, he's the real thing Gran-Gran! I finally found a bender to teach me! \n",
      "KANNA: [Calmly.] Katara, try not to put all your hopes in this boy. \n",
      "KATARA: But he's special! I can tell! [Clenches her fist and closes her eyes in hope.] I sense he's filled with much wisdom. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara opens her eyes again and glances back toward Aang, who is surrounded by a bunch of kids. He smiles while his tongue is stuck to his staff. \n",
      "AANG: [Muffled.] See? Now my tongue is stuck to my staff! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Much to Aang's discomfort, one of the smaller village boys starts to yank his staff, pulling Aang along with every movement. The village kids laugh and applaud Aang as his tongue remains stuck to his staff.\n",
      "The scene shifts to Zuko's ship where Zuko is facing two soldiers dressed in the uniforms of a firebending Fire Nation soldier. Iroh is sitting on a small chair next to them. \n",
      "IROH: [Sternly.] Again. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko opens the fight by spreading his arms in the direction of the two firebenders, showering them with flames. His adversaries block Zuko's attack with ease. Zuko shifts his weight to duck under a retaliation blast of the firebender to his left. The firebender to his right jumps forward to aim a blast at Zuko's feet. The prince propels himself out of the way. He twists around in mid-air and directs another fire blast with his hand to the firebender that retaliated first, and another with his foot to the firebender that aimed for his feet. Both soldiers jump out of the way of Zuko's flames. Zuko lands and stretches his fists out toward his adversaries, ready to face another attack. \n",
      "IROH: [Sighs while he gets up.] No! [Zuko lowers his arms and looks at his uncle.] Power in firebending comes from the breath [Iroh moves his both hand up in front of him to emphasize the breathing motion.], not the muscles. [He stretches his left arm out as if he was sending a fire blast.] The breath becomes energy in the body. The energy extends past your limbs and becomes: fire! [Iroh directs a fire blast at his nephew that evaporates just before it would scorch him.] Get it right this time. \n",
      "ZUKO: [With suppressed anger, he walks toward his uncle and addresses him.] Enough! I've been drilling this sequence all day. Teach me the next set! I'm more than ready! \n",
      "IROH: No, you are impatient. [He sits down again on his chair.] You have yet to master your basics. [He yells his order.] Drill it again! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko clenches his teeth in anger. He turns around and suddenly directs a power fire kick toward one of the soldiers. The firebender attempts to stop the fire blast, but he is unable to and is thrown on his back by its power. \n",
      "ZUKO: [The suppressed anger is very apparent in his voice.] The sages tell us that the Avatar is the last airbender. [Close-up of Iroh, who does not look pleased with the attitude of his nephew.] He must be over a hundred years old by now. He's had a century to master the four elements! I'll need more than basic firebending to defeat him. [Starts to yell at his uncle.] You will teach me the advanced set! \n",
      "IROH: [Concedes reluctantly. On a dire tone.] Very well, [His expression changes completely to one of delight as he picks something up from the ground.] but first, I must finish my roast duck. [He quickly munches down the roast duck, much to the dismay of Zuko.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene shifts back to the Southern Water Tribe, where it pans down to reveal Sokka pacing to and fro, his arms behind his back. \n",
      "SOKKA: [With a stern expression.] Now men, it's important that you show no fear when you face a firebender. [He brings out his club and holds it proudly.] In the Water Tribe, we fight to the last man standing! For without courage, how can we call ourselves men? [He clutches his fist to emphasize the word \"men\" as he stares down the people in front of him.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera shifts positions to reveal that Sokka is talking to six uninterested little boys. \n",
      "SOUTHERN.WATER.TRIBE.BOY: [Waving his hand in the air.] I gotta pee! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Angrily.] Listen! Until your fathers return from the War, they're counting on you to be the men of this tribe, and that means no potty breaks! [He makes some wide arm gestures to emphasize his words again.] \n",
      "SOUTHERN.WATER.TRIBE.BOY: But I really gotta go! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sighs.] Okay, who else has to go? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Every child immediately raises his hand. Sokka is surprised for a second, before facepalming in frustration. \n",
      "KATARA: [Runs up to Sokka as the children leave. In a worried tone.] Have you seen Aang? Gran-Gran said he disappeared over an hour ago. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang appears from an outhouse igloo, pulling his pants up a bit higher. \n",
      "AANG: [Amused.] Wow! Everything freezes in there! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He points toward the bathroom with a smile on his face. Sokka's \"soldiers\" halt beside Aang and laugh with him. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Annoyed.] Uh! [Angrily points at Aang.] Katara, get him out of here! This lesson is for warriors only! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka is about to walk away when he hears the sound of playing children. \n",
      "VILLAGE.BOY: Whee! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He turns around, and the picture follows his gaze to reveal the village children sliding down Appa's tail like a slide. The end of the tail is propped upward, so the children are propelled into the air. They fly over Sokka's spear, now serving as a mark that they need to cross before landing in a soft pile of snow. Katara laughs as a boy lands head-first in the snow, but Sokka rushes forward. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Yelling angrily.] Stop! Stop it right now! [The laughter of the children is stifled immediately and Appa turns his head to look at Sokka, who accusingly directs his anger to Aang.] What's wrong with you?! We don't have time for fun and games with the War going on! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka takes back his spear and casts an annoyed glance at the laughing children who run past him. \n",
      "AANG: [Slides down from Appa's head.] What war? What are you talking about? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Raises one eyebrow in disbelief.] You're kidding, right? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang looks questioningly at Sokka, but the expression on his face changes to enthusiasm when he catches sight of an otter-penguin. \n",
      "AANG: [Exclaims enthusiastically.] Penguin! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The animal is startled by Aang's outburst and quickly waddles off. Aang gives chase, racing past Katara and Sokka, enhancing his speed with his airbending. He leaves a deep trail in the snow as he dashes after the penguin. \n",
      "SOKKA: He's kidding, right? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The siblings glance at each other, not sure what they need to think of Aang's reaction.\n",
      "The scene fades away to show the otter-penguin habitat, where hundreds of otter-penguins are walking or sliding down icebergs. Katara approaches the penguins in search for Aang. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang? \n",
      "AANG: [Chasing the penguins while laughing.] Hey, come on little guy. Wanna go sledding? [He jumps at a penguin, but the animal evades his attempt and Aang belly flops into the snow. He turns on his back and quickly erects himself with his airbending as Katara comes up beside him.] Heh heh. I have a way with animals. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang stretches his arms wide and imitates the sound and movements of the animals around them, making Katara laugh. \n",
      "KATARA: [Amused.] Hehehe, Aang, I'll help you catch a penguin if you teach me waterbending. \n",
      "AANG: [Having grabbed the tail of a penguin, he holds on as it pulls him through the snow for a short way before letting go and looking up at Katara.] You got a deal! Just one little problem ... [He airbends himself into a sitting position.] I'm an airbender, not a waterbender. Isn't there someone in your tribe who can teach you? \n",
      "KATARA: [Sadly.] No. You're looking at the only waterbender in the whole South Pole. \n",
      "AANG: This isn't right. A waterbender needs to master water. [He thinks for a moment.] What about the North Pole? There's another Water Tribe up there, right? Maybe they have waterbenders who could teach you. \n",
      "KATARA: Maybe, but we haven't had contact with our sister tribe in a long time. It's not exactly \"turn right at the second glacier\". It's on the other side of the world. \n",
      "AANG: But you forget, I have a flying bison. [He happily points at himself.] Appa and I can personally fly you to the North Pole. Katara, we're going to find you a master! \n",
      "KATARA: [Unsure.] That's ... I mean, I don't know. I've never left home before. \n",
      "AANG: Well, you think about it, but in the meantime, can you teach me catch one of these penguins? \n",
      "KATARA: [Mockingly imitating a teacher.] Okay, listen closely my young pupil. [Inclines her head toward Aang.] Catching penguins is an ancient and sacred art. [She conjures a fish out of her sleeve.] Observe! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She tosses Aang the fish. As he catches it with an uncomprehending look on his face, the penguins immediately begin crowding him. He laughs as the penguins swarm over him, pulling him down amidst their ranks. \n",
      "AANG: Hi hi hi! Ha, ha, ha! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene switches to a protruding iceberg that Aang and Katara use as a slide, each sitting atop a penguin. They soar through the air for a moment before landing on the slope and continuing their journey downward. They race down and Aang uses another iceberg as a ramp to propel him into the air and to soar over and past Katara. She in turn uses the next jump to land next to Aang again. The two laugh and shout out as they gleefully ride over snowy bumps. \n",
      "KATARA: [Happily.] I haven't done this since I was a kid! \n",
      "AANG: You still are a kid! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two ride through a tunnel of ice. Katara is in the lead and tries to hold Aang back by constantly changing her direction when he wants to pass her. Aang solves this problem by increasing his speed with airbending, enabling him to race over the ceiling past Katara. The tunnel levels out on an open plain of ice where the two get off their rides. The plain itself is dominated by a large metal ship, elevated and held in place by a large protrusion of ice with the bow pointing toward the sky. Curious, Aang gazes at it. \n",
      "AANG: [In awe.] Whoa! What is that? \n",
      "KATARA: [On a slightly dark tone.] A Fire Navy ship. And a very bad memory for my people. [Aang begins to approach the wreckage.] Aang, stop! We're not allowed to go near it! The ship could be booby-trapped! \n",
      "AANG: If you want to be a bender, you have to let go of fear. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara ponders over that remark for a moment and walks toward Aang with a scared look upon her face. The two venture closer toward the ship. Aang helps Katara to climb some of the blocks of ice that lay beside the ship and they crawl through a hole in the hull of the ship. The two walk through the silent rooms of the shipwreck. Some white hamsters roam the otherwise deserted ship. Aang enters a room stocked with weapons in various places. \n",
      "KATARA: [Her voice echoes through the room.] This ship has haunted my tribe since Gran-Gran was a little girl. [The camera shifts through the room, revealing all the weapons more closely.] It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks. \n",
      "AANG: Okay, back up. I have friends all over the world, even in the Fire Nation. [Aang picks up a Guan Dao to inspect it.] I've never seen any war. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, how long were you in that iceberg? \n",
      "AANG: [Uncertain.] I don't know. A few days, maybe? \n",
      "KATARA: I think it was more like a hundred years! \n",
      "AANG: [In full disbelief and slightly accusing.] What?! That's impossible! Do I look like a hundred-twelve-year-old man to you? \n",
      "KATARA: Think about it. The War is a century old. You don't know about it because, somehow, you were in there the whole time! [Aang's expression changes to one of comprehension.] It's the only explanation. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang backs away and slumps to floor in shock. \n",
      "AANG: A hundred years! [Saddened by his new discovery.] I can't believe it. \n",
      "KATARA: [Squats beside him.] I'm sorry, Aang. Maybe somehow there's a bright side to all this ... \n",
      "AANG: [Cheerfully.] I did get to meet you. \n",
      "KATARA: [Smiling warmly at him while offering her hand.] Come on, let's get out of here. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara smiles and pulls him to his feet and the two exit the room. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, let's head back, this place is creepy. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang ventures down yet another room with Katara on his trail. There, he trips over a thin rope; as he stumbles, metal bars slide downward over the entrance, barring it and trapping them inside. \n",
      "AANG: Huh? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They both run toward the bars and peek through them. \n",
      "AANG: What's that you said about booby traps? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The gears and engines of the shipwreck suddenly power up, beginning to function. In shock, Katara and Aang follow the movements of the machines until suddenly, a flare is fired and explodes high in the sky. \n",
      "AANG: Uh oh ... [Aang notices a hole in the roof of the ship and takes a surprised Katara into his arms.] Hold on tight! \n",
      "KATARA: Aaah! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang enhances the power of his jump with his airbending to jump several feet into the air through the hole.\n",
      "The scene switches to Prince Zuko, who is peering through a telescope. He follows every movement the duo makes as Aang, still holding Katara, jumps down the side of the ship. \n",
      "ZUKO: The last airbender! [Aang and Katara reach the ground again and Aang sets Katara down. They start to walk away.] Quite agile for his old age. [He turns and angrily yells to a soldier behind him.] Wake my uncle! Tell him I found the Avatar. [Zuko peeks through his telescope again to see that Katara and Aang are running now. Zuko follows the direction they are running in with his telescope and discovers that they must be headed for the village he spots.] As well as his hiding place ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Close-up of Zuko's right eye as he squints it to look in the direction of the Southern Water Tribe. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to credits. \n",
      "KATARA: Water. Earth. Fire. Air. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang. And although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens onto the yellowing sky as the flare Aang accidentally launched in the previous episode soars lazily through the air in the distance. The camera pans downward to show the figures of Aang and Katara appearing over the horizon. The Southern Water Tribe villagers have gathered in the snow, waiting for the duo's return. Cut to a shot of Aang and Katara approaching the village and the gathered villagers that stand outside the village walls. The children become overjoyed upon seeing Aang. \n",
      "VILLAGE.KIDS: [Joyfully.] Yay! Aang's back! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Some of them run over to him while the others remain cheerful in the crowd. The camera pans up from the children to the adults, revealing more stern and offended expressions. The children reach Aang and Katara, crowding around him gleefully, and Aang responds kindly. Switch to a shot of Sokka, who breaks from the line of villagers and steps forward toward Aang. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Angrily.] I knew it! [Accusingly points a finger at Aang as he and Katara draw closer.] You signaled the Fire Navy with that flare! You're leading them straight to us, aren't you? \n",
      "KATARA: [Protesting.] Aang didn't do anything! It was an accident. \n",
      "AANG: [Sheepishly, as Katara glares at Sokka.] Yeah. We were on the ship and there was this booby trap, and, well -- [Awkwardly rubs his head.] -- we booby-ed right into it. \n",
      "KANNA: [Worriedly.] Katara, you shouldn't have gone on that ship! Now we could all be in danger! \n",
      "AANG: [Sorrowfully.] Don't blame Katara. I brought her there. It's my fault. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Angry and triumphant, having found an excuse.] Aha! The traitor confesses! Warriors, away from the enemy. [The children begin to sadly walk away.] The foreigner is banished from our village. \n",
      "KATARA: [Irritably, clenching her fists.] Sokka, you're making a mistake. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Stubbornly persisting in his anger.] No, I'm keeping my promise to Dad. [Pointing to Aang.] I'm protecting you, from threats like him! \n",
      "KATARA: [Angrily.] Aang is not our enemy! [Continues in a calm, soothing voice.] Don't you see? Aang's brought us something we haven't had in a long time: fun. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Annoyed.] Fun?! We can't fight firebenders with fun! \n",
      "AANG: [Optimistically.] You should try it sometime. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Angrily.] Get out of our village! Now! \n",
      "KATARA: [Pleading.] Grandmother, please. Don't let Sokka do this! \n",
      "KANNA: [Gravely.] Katara, you knew going on that ship was forbidden. Sokka is right. I think it best if the airbender leaves. \n",
      "KATARA: [Outraged.] Fine! Then I'm banished, too! [Drags Aang away.] Come on Aang, let's go. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Demanding.] Where do you think you're going? \n",
      "KATARA: [Angrily.] To find a waterbender. Aang is taking me to the North Pole. \n",
      "AANG: [Confusedly.] I am? [Brightening.] Great! \n",
      "SOKKA: Katara! Would you really choose him over your tribe? [Shows shot of the entire Southern Water Tribe.] Your own family? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A side-view-shot shows that Katara had stopped in her tracks, right between Appa and her tribe. Close-up of Katara, who looks down sorrowfully as Aang approaches her with a sad look upon his face. \n",
      "AANG: [Understanding.] Katara, I don't want to come between you and your family. \n",
      "KATARA: [Upset.] So, you're leaving the South Pole? [In a quieter tone.] This is goodbye? \n",
      "AANG: Thanks for penguin sledding with me. \n",
      "KATARA: [Still in that quiet tone.] Where will you go? \n",
      "AANG: Guess I'll go back home and look for the airbenders. [He places one hand on Appa, but is suddenly struck with realization.] Wow, I haven't cleaned my room in a hundred years. Not looking forward to that. [He uses his airbending to hop onto Appa's head.] It was nice meeting everyone. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sarcastically, with arms crossed.] Let's see your bison fly now, air boy. \n",
      "AANG: [Encouragingly.] Come on Appa, you can do it. Yip-yip! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang flicks the reins, but Appa merely rises and growls. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Mockingly.] Yeah, I thought so! \n",
      "SOUTHERN.WATER.TRIBE.GIRL: [Runs from crowd to stand next to Katara with tears in her eyes.] Ahhh! [Close-up.] Aang, don't go! I'll miss you! \n",
      "AANG: [Sadly.] I'll miss you, too. [Looks at Katara, who frowns back at him, her eyes saddened while her hair loopies sway in the wind.] Come on, boy. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa turns and plods away, disappearing over the hill. The young girl sighs and trudges back to the village, while Katara remains standing in the snow. Kanna walks up to her granddaughter. \n",
      "KANNA: [Consoling tone.] Katara, you'll feel better after you- [Katara quickly turns around and cuts her off.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Rounding on Kanna and interrupting her, her voice full of empassioned rage.] You happy now? [Gestures in the direction Aang took off.] There goes my one chance at becoming a waterbender! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She marches away furiously, leaving Kanna looking saddened. Meanwhile, Sokka coaches the young boys to prepare for battle just outside the village. \n",
      "SOKKA: All right, ready our defenses! The Fire Nation could be on our shores any moment now! \n",
      "SOUTHERN.WATER.TRIBE.BOY: [Stopping and dancing around.] But I gotta ... \n",
      "SOKKA: [Authoritatively, a twinge of annoyance in his voice; he points onward, ushering the boy in that direction.] And no potty breaks! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to a snowy landscape dotted by several ice formations. The camera pans to the right, where Aang and Appa are resting in an ice formation, Appa lying lazily on his back in the lower section and Aang resting above him. Appa grunts. \n",
      "AANG: [Sorrowfully.] Yeah, I liked her too. [Catches sight of Fire Nation ship advancing toward the Southern Water Tribe; gasps.] The village! [He slides off the ice formation onto the ground.] Appa, wait here. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa responds by merely grunting lazily. The scene changes to where Sokka prepares for battle inside a Water Tribe tent. He dons gloves, boots, bindings, and applies face paint. After necessary preparations, he puts his boomerang away on his back.\n",
      "The scene changes to Zuko's ship, where servants are seen helping the Fire Nation prince to put on his Fire Nation outfit, complete with a red helmet ending in a sharp point. Through all this, Zuko never moves a muscle.\n",
      "Cut back to Sokka kneeling inside the tent, grabbing his club. He glances at a candle that flickers as he exits.\n",
      "The scene cuts to an overhead shot of the village, the camera panning upward to the low-stooping wall surrounding the town. Sokka is seen standing atop the wall, overlooking the foggy horizon. Cut back to a shot of the village where a mother is seen squatting beside her child, but she suddenly jerks up upon hearing a loud, cracking noise. Her son gasps for air and the surrounding villagers also turn around in fright to see what the source of the noise was. Kanna, sitting on a log by a camp fire, rises and gasps for air. Suddenly, the ground begins to quake and a rumbling sound is heard in the distance. Kanna gasps louder this time and her face contorts in horror. Switch to a shot of Sokka's feet where bits of the wall are cracking and breaking off. A mother carrying her child slowly backs away in fright. A watchtower on the wall is shaking under the pressure of the trembling, and completely collapses. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Disappointed at the tower's collapse.] Oh man! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a shot of inside the village where the citizens are beginning to flee from the scene. Katara runs up and looks up at her brother still standing atop the wall, and her look turns to one of horror. Cut to a shot of the wall from her perspective; an enormous shadow of the bow of Zuko's ship comes into view. Camera closes in on Sokka's face. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Horrified.] Oh maaan ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A side-view of the ship approaching the village, cutting through the icy sea. Switch to a shot of Kanna standing in the snow, looking up in terror at the vessel while backing up slightly. Villagers pass her in their haste to get to safety and the shadow of the large ships descends over her. Cut to a close-up of the ship's bow as it plows through the snowy shores, splintering the ground. Sokka looks up, terrified by the large ship. The ship's approach creates a large crack that quickly travels toward the village and over the wall. Cut to Katara helping her grandmother into a tent, when she hears a frightened scream. She gasps in terror when she realizes that the sound came from a small boy, kneeling on the ground. The fissure is rapidly approaching him, but Katara quickly runs over and scoops up the child before the ground splinters underneath. She sets the child down again in front of a tent which he quickly enters, and Katara turns back to view her brother. \n",
      "KATARA: [Hysterically.] Sokka, get out of the way! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a shot of Sokka standing on the wall, the bow of the ship plowing through the snow. Sokka raises his club in defense, ready to strike. Before he can make his move, however, the bow crumbles a large portion of the wall into snowy ruins. The snow slides downward, pushing Sokka several feet back before he lands to a halt. With a loud hiss of steam, the ship has come to a halt as well. Switch to an overview shot of the entire village.\n",
      "Cut back to the villagers, who now curiously come out of hiding and are staring in complete shock at the large vessel. The camera pans to the right toward Katara, who is looking at the ship with her mouth open; she gasps. Sokka also gasps when he catches sight of the bow of the ship opening and creaking forward in a burst of steam, forming a walkway. He backs up and falls to the ground once the bow hits the ground with a loud thud. The villagers gather closer around for support and several people even cover their eyes. Katara takes a step back upon noticing the shape of three figures cloaked in the mist.\n",
      "Cut to the top of the walkway, where Prince Zuko emerges from the mist, two guards following close behind him. Cut to the villagers huddled together and Sokka, who kneels in the snow in front of them, ready to defend his tribe. The camera cuts to shot of the top of the walkway and pans downward. Prince Zuko descends from the ship along with the two guards. Sokka lets out a battle cry and charges at the prince with his club to the ready. Switch to a side-view of the walkway, where now even more soldiers trudge down while Sokka is traveling his way upward. When he reaches Zuko, the prince merely kicks the club to his left and, without ever resting his leg on the ground, kicks Sokka over to his right, sending him into the snow, where his head becomes trapped. The warrior desperately tries to free himself as Zuko continues on his way to the village, followed by six more men. Katara covers her mouth in shock upon witnessing her brother's quick defeat.\n",
      "Shift to a shot of the villagers, as Zuko and his men stand before them. Zuko approaches. He passes to the right when he does not seem to find what he is looking for and stops in front of Katara, who is clutching Kanna. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Angrily.] Where are you hiding him? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko surveys the crowd of villagers, who fall completely silent. Without warning, he extends his arm out into the crowd and grabs Kanna, holding her by the hood of her parka. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Shaking Kanna; annoyed.] He'd be about this age, master of all elements? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He shoves Kanna forcefully back into the crowd. The elderly woman shudders in fear and embraces Katara, while Katara shoots an angry glare at Zuko. Receiving no response, Zuko swings his arm out and releases an arc of fire that passes just over the heads of the people, causing them to cover their heads and cry out in fear. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Angrily.] I know you're hiding him! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a shot of Sokka's club lying in the snow. Sokka runs over and picks it up, most of his war paint having come off at this point. He lets out another battle cry as he charges toward the prince. Cut to a shot of Zuko, his back facing the camera. He swiftly turns around just as Sokka approaches. He ducks under Sokka's wide swing and hurls the warrior forward. Sokka lands on his rear in the snow and is quickly forced to dart from his spot when Zuko fires a blast at him. He spins to the side and tosses his boomerang at the enemy who barely manages to miss getting hit by the weapon. Zuko growls and glares at Sokka in anger at the near hit; he follows the course of the weapon until it vanishes before looking back at Sokka in anger. One of the village boys tosses Sokka a spear. \n",
      "VILLAGE.BOY: Show no fear! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka handily catches the weapon and charges at Zuko once more. The camera cuts to a shot from Sokka's perspective as he faces him head-on. Zuko breaks of pieces of the spear with his forearms, pulls the remains of the weapon out of Sokka's hands and pokes him thrice in the head with the blunt end. Sokka falls to the ground as Zuko snaps the spear in two and tosses the pieces to the ground on both of his sides. Cut to shot of Sokka, who rubs his head in pain, before switching back to a head shot of Zuko. A sparkle of light shines briefly in the distance and Sokka's boomerang spins into view, unnoticed by Zuko. The weapon strikes Zuko on the back of his helmet with a loud cling; he is momentarily pushed forward by the unexpected blow. Zuko rearranges his helmet and growls at Sokka. The boomerang has plummeted into the ground in front of Sokka's feet. Enraged, Zuko readies two fire daggers.\n",
      "Cut to shot of Aang, who is seen rapidly riding on a penguin toward the battle scene. He holds his glider horizontal on the animal and he has a determined look on his face. His tongue is out of his mouth in pure concentration. Cut to shot of Zuko's backside. The camera closes in on Zuko as Aang takes his feet out from underneath him, tossing Zuko off his feet; speeding past, Aang soars into the air as the prince lands on his face, his legs in the air. He spins around a few times before coming to a halt in front of his men, his helmet landing on his rear as they watch.\n",

Switch to a shot of a group of several other villagers, including Kanna, Katara, and Sokka. Aang comes to a halt before them. The penguin crawls out from under him, tossing him off. Aang falls on his rear, blinking stupidly. Aang smiles at the penguin when the animal quacks at him before waddling away. \n",

Shift to an overhead shot of Aang assuming a fighting stance as well, his staff held firmly in front of him as he is being surrounded by the soldiers. He sweeps the ground side-to-side with his staff, showering the men with snow. He subsequently slams the ground, sending a rush of snow at Zuko who braces for the impact. After being sprayed with snow, and heating it up so it would melt off, Zuko looks up angrily. \n",

Cut to a shot of the villagers, who cower as the flames stream through the air over their heads. Aang widens his eyes in horror at the sight of the frightened villagers and immediately ceases to defend himself. \n",

Several villagers surround the collapsed wall, surveying the damage and trying to repair the collapsed watch tower by digging it out. Several others work together to help put up a fallen tent. Cut to shot of the Southern shores where Katara is standing on the edge in the distance. The camera closes in on where she is standing. \n",
      "KATARA: [Sokka is seen in the background, carrying a pack as she speaks on a determined tone.] We have to go after that ship, Sokka. Aang saved our tribe, now we have to save him. \n",

      "ZUKO: This staff will make an excellent gift for my father. [Inspects the staff further.] I suppose you wouldn't know of fathers, being raised by monks. [To his soldiers.] Take the Avatar to the prison hold, [Handing the staff to Iroh.] and take this to my quarters. \n",

He walks down a corridor, one soldier before him, one following after him. \n",
      "AANG: [Slyly.] So, I guess you've never fought an airbender before. I bet I could take you both with my hands tied behind my back. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The party stops and Aang observes the soldier in front of him preparing to unlock a door. As the guard in front of him begins to unlock the cell, Aang inhales deeply and unleashes a powerful breath, stunning both of them. The firebender before him slams into the door subsequently knocked out from the impact. Aang is sent several feet back, slamming into the guard behind him. They both fly back even further, where they crash into the stairs. The soldier behind Aang is also knocked out by the impact, while Aang propels himself onto the deck and kicks open a door using airbending. He quickly runs down the hallway, panting heavily.

      "AANG: [Off camera.] Thanks anyway! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He continues racing through the hallways of the ship and encounters a single guard when he rose another deck. The soldier fires a blast at Aang, who leaps forward. A slow-motion shot depicts Aang somersaulting over the soldier and using the sharp tip of his helmet to cut his bindings, thus freeing him. The soldier falls over from the impact and Aang proceeds down the hall. The young Avatar races through the interior, opening two doors leading to various compartments of the ship. Upon opening the third door, he finds Iroh sleeping blissfully, snoring. He begins closing the door, his mouth still visible through the crack. \n",

He ducks to avoid another fire blast. Cut to Zuko standing in the middle of the room, Aang managing to roll over directly behind his opponent. Aang deftly manages to stay behind Zuko, utilizing circle-walking. Zuko spins around, desperately attempting to land a blow.\n",
      "The scene cuts to a shot of the deck and cabin of the ship, the window of the room where the battle is occurring illuminating two consecutive times from the fire blasts. Cut back to inside the room, where Aang uses airbending to try and deter another one of Zuko's attacks by catching his flames in a current of air. After extinguishing yet another one of his attacks, Aang uses Zuko as a stepping stone. He pushes himself off against his head and creates an air scooter in mid-air that he uses to ride around the room and over the walls and ceiling, as Zuko resumes attacking.\n",
      "He avoids Zuko's repeated attacks; however, the prince manages to dissipate the air scooter by shattering it with a flame arc. Aang is smacked against the wall underneath a hanging tapestry. He quickly pushes himself up under the tapestry to avoid another fire blast. When he emerges at the top, he grabs the tapestry off its hooks and wraps it around Zuko's body, tangling him momentarily. This brief intermission gives Aang enough time to grab his glider and he turns around to face his opponent, pointing the end of the staff at Zuko, who destroys the tapestry with firebending. Zuko assumes a fighting stance, while Aang looks on with alarm. Cut to shot of the entire room, as Aang uses airbending to propel a mattress lying in a corner toward Zuko. The mattress slams into the Fire Nation prince, sending him colliding into the wall, before falling onto the mattress. Aang propels the mattress upward, sending Zuko slamming into the ceiling of the room. Aang makes a break for it before the mattress touches the ground again. Zuko and the mattress fall to the floor, and Zuko remains lying face down upon it. Cut to shot of Zuko, who raises his head and glances around the empty room, fuming.\n",
      "Cut to the main control room of the ship. The wheel of the hatch located toward the back of the room begins spinning rapidly. The hatch opens with a small tornado of air and Aang emerges. Cut to a shot of the rest of the control room, a man at the helm. Cut to Aang, who leaps from the hatch and runs across the room, leaping over a table and past the man who looks up in surprise. He exits the room and runs onto the upper deck of the ship. Cut to an overhead shot of the upper deck as Aang happily spreads his arms and welcomes the fresh air. He throws his staff over the balcony which opens into a glider and begins soaring away. He appears successful until Zuko appears on screen, leaping forward, his arms extended outward. While yelling, Zuko manages to grab hold of Aang's ankle. Cut to shot of Aang, whose expression of triumph turns into one of despair as he begins losing altitude, struggling to maintain the weight of the extra, unexpected person.\n",

Both lie on the deck for a moment. Close-up of Zuko's eyes, as they narrow in anger. Zuko begins rising, a look of persistence on his face. Aang rises and assumes a fighting stance, looking very unsure of himself. Before the fight could begin, Appa's growl distracts both fighters.

However, he propels himself by accident into the air and lands on the ledge of the deck. He leans precariously over the side, unsteadily balancing himself, but manages to regain his balance only for Zuko to fire another blast at him. He twirls his glider again to deflect the attack. Two more blasts are fired his way before he loses his grip on his glider and the object spins away. The staff falls several feet away. Aang ducks, spins and leaps out of the way of blasts and lands on the very ledge, struggling to keep his balance. Zuko hurls more fire blasts his way. Aang holds up his hands in defense, but the last blast seemingly knocks him out cold and he falls backward off the ship into the water, where he slowly sinks. Cuts to shot of Katara riding atop Appa. \n",

Katara still stands beside the large beast while Aang lies on top of his head. Cut to three soldiers, who rise after being knocked down by Aang's water attack and menacingly approach her. Katara takes a step back and slowly and precariously bends a stream of water from the puddle, causing the men to slow down and gasp in surprise. She swings her arms around in an attempt to whip them, however, only succeeds in freezing a channel of water behind her on the deck, encasing Sokka's legs in ice in the process. \n",

      "KATARA: But Aang, the world's been waiting for the Avatar to return and finally put an end to this war. \n",
      "AANG: [Downcast.] And how am I going to do that? \n",
      "KATARA: According to legend, you need to first master water, then earth, then fire, right? \n",
      "AANG: [Looking at Katara.] That's what the monks told me. \n",
      "KATARA: [Brightening a bit.] Well, if we go to the North Pole, you can master waterbending! \n",
      "AANG: [Turning to face her, smiling and brightening up completely.] We can learn it together! \n",
      "KATARA: [Faces her brother; cheerfully.] And Sokka, I'm sure you'll get to knock some firebender heads on the way. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Content.] I'd like that. I'd reeally like that. \n",
      "KATARA: [Optimistically.] Then we're in this together! \n",
      "AANG: [Cheerfully, pulling out a rolled up scroll.] All right, but before I learn waterbending, we have some serious business to attend to. [He uses airbending to situate himself onto the saddle and unrolls the scroll, revealing a map of the Avatar World.] Here, here and here. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: While stating this, he points to three locations, two in the Earth Kingdom, one in Air Nomad territory. \n",
      "KATARA: [Curiously.] What's there? [Points to one of the locations.] \n",
      "AANG: [Points to the location in Earth Kingdom.] Here, we'll ride the hopping llamas. [Points to the location in Air Nomad territory.] Then waaay over here, we'll surf on the backs of giant koi fish. [Katara and Sokka stare at him in wonder.] Then back over here, we'll ride the hog monkeys. [The siblings glance at each other.] They don't like people riding them, but that's what makes it fun! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Close-up of Aang, as he smiles enthusiastically, his eyes widened with excitement. Cut to a wide shot of Appa flying peacefully in the sky, sunbeams breaking through the clouds behind him. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode begins with a beautiful sunrise that just peeks above some cliffs. The beams of the morning sun reflect on the water, bathing the whole scene in yellow light. The camera pans to the left, where the group has made camp on the shore. Appa is seen chewing on some grass while the smoke of the nearby campfire rises to the sky. Sokka is lying in a blue sleeping bag next to the fire. The camera zooms in on Aang and Katara atop Appa. Aang sits on the bison's head and is checking the knots that tie the reins to Appa's horns. Katara is sitting on the saddle, fiddling with their luggage. \n",
      "AANG: [Excitedly.] Wait 'til you see it, Katara! The Air Temple is one of the most beautiful places in the world! \n",
      "KATARA: [Cautiously.] Aang, I know you're excited, [She turns around to face him.] but it's been a hundred years since you've been home. \n",
      "AANG: [Smiling broadly.] That's why I'm so excited! \n",
      "KATARA: [Cautiously.] It's just that ... a lot can change in all that time. \n",
      "AANG: [Happily.] I know, but I need to see it for myself. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang jumps off Appa, landing softly due to his airbending. A side-view shows him as he walks over to a snoring Sokka, who is lying in his sleeping bag. The shot changes to a view from next to Sokka's head, looking up at the approaching airbender. \n",
      "AANG: [Cheerfully.] Wake up, Sokka! Air Temple, here we come! [Sokka awakens, making groggy noises.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Grunting sleepily.] Uggh! Sleep now. Temple later. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka turns around, showing his back to Aang and falls back asleep, snoring as soon as his eyes close. Close-up of Aang, whose big eyes blink in surprise. He looks discontent with Sokka's attitude, but he quickly smiles mischievously. Aang grabs a small, thin stick. \n",
      "AANG: [Alarmed.] Sokka! Wake up! [Aang moves the stick up and down the sleeping bag, only touching Sokka with the tip of it.] There's a prickle snake in your sleeping bag! \n",
      "SOKKA: [He lazily opens one eye before yelling out in horror.] Ahh! [He quickly rises and hops around, still inside the sleeping bag.] Get it off! Get it off! [After two hops, Sokka slams flat to the ground.] Ahh! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara giggles, as Sokka falls over. Close-up of Sokka's angry face. \n",
      "AANG: [Happily.] Great! You're awake! Let's go! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene slowly fades to a harbor, where several Fire Nation ships are lined up next to each other. The camera pans to the left to reveal a smaller ship docked between all the others, identical mastodons. Its walkway is down and the small figures of two persons are seen leaving the ship. Cut to a closer shot of Zuko and Iroh, as they reach the bottom of the walkway. \n",
      "ZUKO: Uncle, I want the repairs made as quickly as possible. I don't want to stay too long and risk losing his trail. \n",
      "IROH: [Disinterested.] You mean the Avatar? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Turns around sharply to face Iroh, as he slightly backs off.] Don't mention his name on these docks! [Makes some wide arm movements.] Once word gets out that he's alive, every firebender will be out looking for him, and I don't want anyone getting in the way! \n",
      "ZHAO: [Iroh and Zuko turn, with shocked expressions on their face, toward the camera in the direction the sound came from.] Getting in the way of what, [Close-up of a man with big sideburns dressed in a Fire Nation uniform.] Prince Zuko? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The man walks over to the duo with his hands held behind his back. Zuko awaits him with his arms crossed with contempt, while Iroh just stares at him. \n",
      "ZUKO: [With dislike in his voice.] Captain Zhao. \n",
      "ZHAO: [Smirks.] It's commander now. And [Bows slightly in Iroh's direction.] General Iroh. Great hero of our nation. \n",
      "IROH: [Bows back.] Retired general. \n",
      "ZHAO: The Fire Lord's brother and son are welcome guests anytime. What brings you to my harbor? \n",
      "IROH: Our ship is being repaired. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As Iroh gestures toward the ship, the camera moves back to show the severely damaged ship. \n",
      "ZHAO: That's quite a bit of damage. \n",
      "ZUKO: Yes. [He holds up one finger, while Iroh stares disinterested in front of him.] You wouldn't believe what happened. [He glances at his uncle, and angrily commands him as he gestures at Zhao.] Uncle! Tell Commander Zhao what happened. \n",
      "IROH: [Iroh's eyes open wide in surprise, as he is addressed by Zuko.] Yes. I will do that. [He happily holds his hand up and relates enthusiastically.] It was incredible! [To Zuko, from the corner of his mouth in a confused tone.] What? Did we crash or something? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Looks at his uncle uncomfortably.] Yes! Right into ... an Earth Kingdom ship! \n",
      "ZHAO: [In disbelief.] Really? You must regale me with all of the thrilling details. [Smirks while he gets into Zuko's face.] Join me for a drink? \n",
      "ZUKO: [He averts his gaze and begins to walk away.] Sorry, but we have to go. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zhao smiles evilly at him as he starts to walk away, but after a few steps, Iroh place his hand on his shoulder to hold him back. \n",
      "IROH: Prince Zuko, show Commander Zhao your respect. [Removes his hand from Zuko's shoulder as he faces Zhao while Zuko just slants his eyes.] We would be honored to join you. Do you have any ginseng tea? It's my favorite. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Iroh and Zhao walk off screen. Zuko grunts in anger upon hearing Iroh's tea comment. He growls angrily and firebends a small arc out of annoyance as he turns to walk after them.\n",
      "The scene cuts to Appa, who is flying above the clouds in the Patola Mountain range. A closer shot reveals Aang and Katara sitting atop Appa's head, and Sokka is back in the saddle. Switch to a close-up of him clutching his stomach at it growls. Close-up of his face, with a look of dismay all over it. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Annoyed.] Hey, stomach? Be quiet, all right? I'm trying to find us some food. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka starts to go through the luggage and gets out a bag. He looks at it for a moment while it sways in the wind. With his tongue out of his mouth full anticipation, he sticks his hand in the bag and starts to go through it. He looks surprised for a moment, but quickly and with anticipation turns the bag upside down to pour the contents into his hand. Close-up of his gloved hand as only a few crumbs of blubbered seal jerky fall into it. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Accusingly to the two in front of him.] Hey! Who ate all of my blubbered seal jerky?! \n",
      "AANG: [Surprised.] Oh. That was food? [Happily.] I used it to start the campfire last night. [The hint of a smile can be heard.] Sorry. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Shocked.] You what?! [Looks up before slanting his eyes and groans. Longing.] No wonder the flames smelled so good. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a wider shot, as Appa races past and ascends up to some mountains. \n",
      "AANG: [Excitedly.] The Patola Mountain range! We're almost there! \n",
      "KATARA: [Uneasily.] Aang, before we get to the temple, I want to talk to you about the airbenders. \n",
      "AANG: [Cheerfully.] What about 'em? \n",
      "KATARA: [Close-up of Katara.] Well, I just want you to be prepared for what you might see. The Fire Nation is ruthless. [Sadly.] They killed my mother, and they could have done the same to your people. \n",
      "AANG: [Ponders over her words for a bit. Hopefully.] Just because no one has seen an airbender, doesn't mean the Fire Nation killed them all. They probably escaped! \n",
      "KATARA: [Places one hand on Aang's shoulder.] I know it's hard to accept. \n",
      "AANG: [Cheerfully, as Katara moves her hand back to her side.] You don't understand, Katara. The only way to get to an airbender temple is on a flying bison, and I doubt the Fire Nation has any flying bison! [Caresses Appa's head.] Right, Appa? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa grunts. The camera moves back to show that Appa flies past to begin a last ascent up the side of a mountain. \n",
      "AANG: Yip yip! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: An overview shot follows Appa's flight up the mountain and through the clouds. Appa turns out of sight behind the flank of a mountain. The camera view shifts and Appa is seen emerging from behind that flank and turns further upward. Close-up of his passengers. Aang holds onto the reins tightly as Appa rapidly ascends while Katara, whose eyes are closed, and Sokka hold on tight to Appa's fur and saddle respectively. Aang looks back for a moment to his passengers. The camera switches to a further off view of Appa as he flies over the rocks and into the sky again. He flies over a last ridge that is covered with trees. The camera pans up to reveal a large temple as Appa floats toward it. \n",
      "AANG: [Voice-over.] There it is. The Southern Air Temple. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, it's amazing! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang is visibly excited as a close-up shows how his eyes widen upon the sight of the temple. \n",
      "AANG: [To Appa.] We're home, buddy! We're home. [His eyes squint a bit in happiness.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene switches back to the Earth Kingdom docks, where several Fire Navy ships are lined up. Something that looks like a railroad stretches out along the shipyard. The camera moves to the right to reveal a number of tents lined up in front of the ships. One of the bigger tents is being guarded by two Fire Nation soldiers. Switch to a shot of Zhao inside the tent, standing in front of a large map of the Avatar World that is hung up on the wall. He holds his hands behind his back. The camera slowly starts to move back. \n",
      "ZHAO: ... And by the year's end, the Earth Kingdom capital will be under our rule. [Shift to a bird view of the tent, revealing Zuko, sitting at a table, and Iroh, standing in the corner, looking at some weapons that are placed against the wall. Zhao turns around.] The Fire Lord will finally claim victory in this war. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Close-up. Angrily.] If my father thinks the rest of the world will follow him willingly, then he is a fool! \n",
      "ZHAO: [Pulls up alongside Zuko and smirks.] Two years at sea have done little to temper your tongue. So, how is your search for the Avatar going? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Iroh knocks over a weapon display behind them. The weapons come crashing down with a lot of noise. The general cowers at the noise and the damage he wrecked. Zhao turns around looking annoyed. \n",
      "IROH: Eh.. My fault, entirely. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Iroh places his hands in his sleeves and walks away backward out of the screen with a faint smile on his face. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Aggressively.] We haven't found him yet. \n",
      "ZHAO: Did you really expect to? The Avatar died a hundred years ago. [Close-up of Zuko, as he slants his eyes.] Along with the rest of the airbenders. [Close-up of Zhao, whose face contorts in an evil expression.] Unless you have found some evidence that the Avatar is alive? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Faces Zhao and responds very clearly.] No. [Stares back in front of him.] Nothing. \n",
      "ZHAO: [With an expression of disbelief on his face, as he rises from his chair.] Prince Zuko, the Avatar is the only one who can stop the Fire Nation from winning this war. [Leans in and faces Zuko.] If you have an ounce of loyalty left, you'll tell me what you found. \n",
      "ZUKO: I haven't found [Looks up at Zhao and his tone becomes slightly more aggressive.] anything. [Close-up, as he continues on a softer tone, slightly mockingly.] It's like you said. The Avatar probably died a long time ago. [Gets up.] Come on, Uncle, we're going. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As Zuko approaches the door, the guards stop him from leaving by crossing their spears while a third soldier enters the room. The camera switches to Zhao's point of view. Zuko and the two soldiers blocking his path can be seen in the background. The camera pans to the right to reveal the soldier that entered walking up to Zhao. \n",
      "SOLDIER: Commander Zhao, we interrogated the crew as you instructed. They confirmed Prince Zuko had the Avatar in custody, [Close-up of Zuko's head from behind.] but let him escape. \n",
      "ZHAO: [Smiling evilly.] Now remind me, [Close-up of Zuko's face, as Zhao walks up to him and leans over to talk into Zuko's ear. Zuko slants his eyes.] how, exactly, was your ship damaged? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene fades to a shot of the Southern Air Temple, as the camera slowly moves closer toward it. Cut to Appa, who has landed at the base of snow covered stairs. The camera quickly pans up to reveal three small figures making their way up the mountain trail. The lead figure is running. Close-up of Aang as he runs at the front, excitedly looking back at the two siblings. As the two emerge from behind a corner, Aang runs off the screen. \n",
      "SOKKA: So where do I get something to eat? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Closer shot of the two siblings. Sokka clutches his stomach with both hands. The bags under his eyes are darkened and he has a very annoyed look on his face. \n",
      "KATARA: [Irritated.] You're lucky enough to be one of the first outsiders to ever visit an airbender temple, and all you can think about is food? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera switches to a broader view as the two siblings draw level with Aang, who is waiting for them at the next corner. \n",
      "SOKKA: I'm just a simple guy, with simple needs. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Switch to a front view of Aang, who points at something in front of him as Katara and Sokka approach. \n",
      "AANG: [Excited.] So that's where my friends and I would play airball, [The camera shifts to a shot of a stadium consisting of many tall poles.] and over there [The camera pans to the right to reveal the trio again.] is where the bison would sleep, and ... [Aang sighs.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Switch to a front view of Aang, with Katara and Sokka in the background. Aang looks sad at the deserted remains of his home. \n",
      "KATARA: What's wrong? \n",
      "AANG: [A bit saddened.] This place used to be full of monks and lemurs and bison. Now there's just a bunch of weeds. [His eyes squint with sadness. The shot changes to a back view of Aang as he stands on the ledge; his clothes flutter in the wind, a dead tree at each side of him. In a sad tone.] I can't believe how much things have changed. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera moves back to show that Katara and Sokka give each other a look of sympathy. They quickly approach Aang. The camera switches back to a front view of Aang, who still looks sad as Katara and Sokka pull up beside him. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Cheerfully trying to distract Aang from his sadness.] So uh, this airball game. How do you play? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara smiles at her brother and Aang's face clears up. He smiles too, as he looks at Sokka from the corners of his eyes. Cut to a shot of Sokka, looking concentrated while standing on a pole and guarding the goal of the airball court. The camera quickly moves back to the other side of the court, where Aang also stands on one of the tall poles, suspending a hollow ball in the air with airbending. He lets the ball roll over his shoulders, tosses it from side to side and lazily tosses it up in the air. He looks and smiles innocently at Sokka with his hands behind his back. Switch to Sokka, who looks surprised at the upward movement of the ball before cutting back to Aang who opens one eye as the ball comes down again. The airbender jumps up and kicks the ball away with a powerful air swipe. It rapidly shoots across the poles, changing direction as it crashes into several poles, but steadily moving closer toward Sokka's goal. Switch to Sokka's point of view as the ball races quickly toward him. Change to a side-view of Sokka, who opens his mouth in shock. He grunts as the ball hits him right in the stomach. The force of impact sends Sokka and the ball flying backward, right through the rotating door of the goal behind him. The camera moves further back to reveal Sokka crashing into the snow behind the goal. Aang laughs as he jumps up in joy. Close-up of Aang as he holds a hand above his eyes to make out where Sokka landed. \n",
      "AANG: [Smiling broadly, he stretches out his arms above his head.] Aang, seven! [He forms a Zero with his hands and makes a circular movement with his whole body.] Sokka, zero! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a shot of Sokka lying in the dirt. A twig is lying on his head while he looks a bit miserable. Katara stands in the background looking at her brother. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Painfully.] Making him feel better is putting me in a world of hurt. [He erects himself, but before he gets up completely, his eyes widen when he sees something in front of him and he crawls to the front. The camera shifts to reveal an old Fire Nation helmet lying in the snow. It has been battered by the elements, and shows signs of cracks and burns. He looks up at his sister.] Katara, check this out. \n",
      "KATARA: Fire Nation. \n",
      "SOKKA: We should tell him. \n",
      "KATARA: [Yelling.] Aang! There's something you need to see. \n",
      "AANG: [Aang runs to them from the airball court, still playing with the hollow ball. Cheerfully.] Okay! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Close-up of Katara, as her determined look to tell Aang the truth shifts to one of insecurity. She glances at the helmet and back at the approaching Aang. Suddenly she shifts her weight and brings her arms up. With one swift movement she swings her arms back, manipulating the overhanging snow to fall down, obscuring the helmet and Sokka from sight. \n",
      "AANG: [Happily runs up.] What is it? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka brushes the snow off his head in the background and looks at his sister. \n",
      "KATARA: [Innocently holds her hands behind her back.] Uh ... Just a new waterbending move I learned. \n",
      "AANG: Nice one! But enough practicing, [Excited as he turns around and start walking away.] we have a whole temple to see! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Brushes the last of the snow from his head and shoulders.] You know, you can't protect him forever. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara sadly slants her eyes and walks after Aang. The scene switches to a full view of one of the temple's many towers and quickly pans down to reveal that the trio has made it to a courtyard with a fountain in the middle. The water is frozen. Sokka and Katara are standing at the entrance of the courtyard, while Aang runs up ahead excitedly. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Arms crossed; stern.] Katara, firebenders were here. You can't pretend they weren't. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara walks passed her brother. Camera view switches to a side-view. Sokka pulls up beside Katara as she is talking. \n",
      "KATARA: I can for Aang's sake. If he finds out that the Fire Nation invaded his home, he'll be devastated. \n",
      "AANG: [Happily.] Hey guys! [The two look up and see Aang standing in front of a statue of a monk, turning around and pointing toward it.] I want you to meet somebody! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Point of view switches to a shot from over the shoulder of the statue. \n",
      "SOKKA: Who's that? \n",
      "AANG: [Facing the statue again.] Monk Gyatso! The greatest airbender in the world. [Scene switches to a frontal view of the statue as Aang turns around again toward the siblings while gesturing at the statue.] He taught me everything I know. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang bows to the statue of an elderly man with a mustache and a distinct round necklace sitting in lotus with his fists bumped to each other in front of him, while the camera zooms in on it. When the shot has zoomed in to a close-up of the statue's face, the scene changes to a flashback of Aang's past, the statue's face is replaced by the face of the real Gyatso. The scenery also become much brighter as it is a flashback of a sunny day at the Southern Air Temple. \n",
      "GYATSO: But the true secret, is in the gooey center. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera moves back a bit to reveal that Monk Gyatso is standing in front of an oven. With the use of a long wooden paddle, he retracts an orange, fruit pie out of the oven. With the use of his airbending, he creates a miniature tornado to spin out the fruity center of the pie.\n",
      "The camera moves back to reveal Aang sitting on the ledge of the balcony, resting his left hand on his knee while staring into nothing. A bison is grazing in the trees on the background. \n",
      "AANG: [Distant.] Hmm ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Gyatso walk over to the ledge as well and places his newly baked cake next to three others that were already standing there. \n",
      "GYATSO: [With a calm, soothing and understanding voice.] My ancient cake-making technique isn't the only thing on your mind, is it, Aang? \n",
      "AANG: [Downcast.] This whole Avatar thing, m-maybe the monks made a mistake. \n",
      "GYATSO: The only mistake they made was telling you before you turned sixteen, but we can't concern ourselves with what was. We must act on what is. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Gyatso extends his arm and while he does so, the camera moves back to reveal the beauty of the Southern Air Temple. The sky is filled with several sky bison with their calves who are feasting from the nearby trees. Sun beams bathe the scene in bright light. \n",
      "AANG: [Voice-over.] But Gyatso? How do I know if I'm ready for this? \n",
      "GYATSO: [Cut back to a close shot of Gyatso with Aang sitting on the ledge in the background.] Your questions will be answered when you're old enough to enter the air temple sanctuary. Inside, you will meet someone who will guide you on your journey. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera moves slowly toward Aang whose face clears up. He uses his airbending to shift positions on the ledge, now facing his guardian and teacher. \n",
      "AANG: [Excited and curious.] Who is it? \n",
      "GYATSO: [Cut back to the close shot of Gyatso with Aang in the background.] When you are ready, he will reveal himself to you. [In the background, Aang, annoyed by this vague answer, grunts softly and looks up to the sky before cupping his face in his hands again. Monk Gyatso continues on a bright, happy tone.] Now, are you going to help me with these cakes, [Close-up of Aang as he smiles lovingly at Gyatso.] or not? \n",
      "AANG: [Happily stands up.] All right. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to a close-up of a purple fruit pie with Aang and Gyatso in the background. They take on an airbending stance, bringing their hand back. \n",
      "GYATSO: One. [The camera switches to a side-view as the duo conjures a small air ball.] Two. Three! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They shift their weight to the front, launching their air balls. The balls send the four fruit pies flying high in the air, disappearing in the clouds. The scene of the flying cakes switches to a shot of four monks in lotus, meditating quietly between some trees. Suddenly, the cakes drop out of the sky and each of the monks is hit on the head by one of the colorful desserts. The monk at the far left of the line topples over upon impact. The moment the pies hit their heads, several flying lemurs appear and start to stuff their faces. One of the lemurs jumps up and down on the stomach of the toppled-over monk, while another grabs some cake right of the head of the monk on the far right. One of the lemurs jumps on the head on one of the monks. Cut back to Aang and Gyatso, who are laughing loudly at the scene. Aang is clutching his stomach, while Monk Gyatso is leaning on the railing of the balcony. They both move back from the railing when they are done laughing. The two monks bow at each other \n",
      "GYATSO: [Full admiration and love.] Your aim has improved greatly, [Caressing Aang's head.] my young pupil. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The flashback fades back to reveal Aang in the present, bowing the same way before the statue as he had done for the real Gyatso. The camera switches to a frontal view of Aang as he erects himself with a sad look upon his face. \n",
      "KATARA: [Understandingly places a hand on his shoulder.] You must miss him. \n",
      "AANG: [Downcast.] Yeah. [He walks away.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Curious.] Where are you going? \n",
      "AANG: [Switch to a shot from Katara's point of view. Aang is walking up some stairs that lead to a corridor behind the statue. He looks back while answering.] The air temple sanctuary. There's someone I'm ready to meet. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang enters the hallway. Cut back to Katara; she looks questioningly at Sokka, who just shrugs. They both start walking after Aang. Switch to an overview shot of inside the corridor. The round symbol of intertwined air currents, the national symbol of the Air Nomads is largely embedded in the floor, surrounded by two square shapes that form some sort of sun together. The camera pans up to reveal that the trio has reached the entrance of the air temple sanctuary. The door supports a combination of metal colored pipes and three, blue, rolled up, pipes that are similar looking and arranges like the symbol for airbending. The large wooden door is framed by the branches of an old tree standing on the left of it and the hallway is illuminated by sunlight that falls through little, round windows. \n",
      "KATARA: But Aang, no one could have survived in there for a hundred years. \n",
      "AANG: [Camera changes to show the trio looking up at the door. Hopeful.] It's not impossible. [Opening his arms.] I survived in the iceberg for that long. \n",
      "KATARA: [Touching her chin with a finger.] Good point. \n",

      "SOKKA: [Appears in screen from behind Aang's back. Katara and Aang look surprised at him. Eagerly.] And whoever's in there might have [Katara's look changes to one of annoyance. Close-up of Sokka's determined, anticipating face.] a medley of delicious [He rubs his hands together and practically starts to drool over the thought.] cured meats! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Full of anticipation and longing, Sokka charges at the door, but it will not budge and he simply smacks into it, head first. He quickly turns around and puts his back to it, trying to push the giant door open. When the door does not move, he sighs, slides down to the floor, disappointed, and rests against the door. \n",
      "SOKKA: I don't suppose you have a key? \n",
      "AANG: [Shot from over Sokka's shoulder.] The key, Sokka, is airbending. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Close-up of Aang, as he takes a deep breath. He spreads his arms and thrusts them forward, sending an air current into both of the tubes on the door. The camera follows the path of the right air current as it travels through the pipe. The wind makes one of the blue curled tube turn around. When it does, the tube changes colors to purple and the wind blows out like a horn. The process is repeated for the other two blue tubes as well. When the three blue tubes have turned and become purple, the camera moves back to show that Aang has unlocked the door and it slowly starts to open. Switch to a shot from inside the sanctuary, as the door cracks open and light penetrates the dark room. The doors sway open and Aang is seen standing there with Katara and Sokka in the background.

      "ZHAO: So a twelve-year-old boy bested you and your firebenders. [Wider shot of the tent as Zhao stops pacing. Iroh can be seen sitting in a corner.] You're more pathetic than I thought. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Angrily.] I underestimated him once, but it will not happen again! \n",
      "ZHAO: [Frontal view with Zuko in the background. Aggressively.] No, it will not. Because you won't have a second chance. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Alarmed.] Commander Zhao, [Closer shot of Zuko.] I've been hunting the Avatar for two years and I - \n",
      "ZHAO: [Cut to a shot from over Zuko's shoulder as Zhao angrily turns around, spreading flames in an arc.] And you failed! [He walks intimidatingly up to Zuko.] Capturing the Avatar is too important to leave in a teenager's hands. He's mine now. \n",

      "KATARA: It's true. [The picture pans up the reveal Aang staring at the statue of an elderly man with a beard. In the background hundreds of statues can be seen spiraling up.] When the Avatar dies, he's reincarnated into the next nation in the cycle. \n",

      "SOKKA: You were a firebender? No wonder I didn't trust you when we first met. \n",

      "AANG: I'm not sure. I just know it somehow. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Growls irritably while crossing his arms.] You just couldn't get any weirder. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The trio startles and stares with big eyes in front of them when they hear something. They turn around.

The camera pans to the right toward the statues, but the trio cannot be seen. Overview shot from among the statues where Katara and Aang are hiding behind a statue on the left and Sokka, who is holding his club ready, hides behind a statue to the right. The shadow is creeping closer. Cut to a closer shot of the threesome. Katara has her teeth clutched in fright, while Aang looks in front of him. Sokka holds his hand to his mouth as he addresses them. \n",

      "SOKKA: [Aang glares angrily at Sokka, before the scene switches to a close-up of his drooling face. Challenging.] Not if I get him first! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka stretches his hand while he excitedly lunges himself at the animal from behind the statue. Aang runs up at the lemur as well. Point of view switches to that of the boys. The lemur arcs his back in fright, his ears, hair and tail standing upright as the snatching hands of the boys draw closer.

Aang nimbly avoids the club and uses his airbending to run on the side of the wall, laughing loudly with amusement. Cut to a shot from Sokka's point of view as Aang runs up ahead. The airbender runs on the floor again. He quickly turns around and directs on airball at Sokka, which knocks his legs from underneath him.

[Close-up of Zhao lying on the floor.] Disgraceful. [Cut back to a closer shot of Zuko and Iroh.] Even in exile, my nephew is more honorable than you. [Zuko looks at Iroh upon hearing those last words. Switch to a shot from over Zhao's shoulders.] Thanks again for the tea. It was delicious. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Iroh and Zuko turn and walk toward the gate of the arena. Zhao partially erects himself, with his left arm resting on his left knee, and grunts as he watches them go. Overview shot of Iroh and Zuko exiting the arena and a close-up of the duo. \n",

      "Cut to Aang, who is still suspended in the air in his sphere. Strong winds are rampaging through the rubble of the destroyed building. Katara and Sokka are holding on for dear life on some stones, trying not to get blown away. \n",
      "KATARA: [In the background, Sokka is hunched over his rock, clenching his teeth together. Katara shouts calmly with a sad expression on her face. The camera slowly moves in on her.] Aang! I know you're upset and I know how hard it is to lose the people you love. I went through the same thing when I lost my mom. [Diverts her eyes. Shot switches to a frontal view of Aang, his tattoos glowing and wind swirling around him; his clothes flutter in the storm. Sokka runs over to his sister in the background.] Monk Gyatso and the other airbenders may be gone, [Close-up of her as she looks up at him.] but you still have a family. Sokka and I! [Sokka opens his eyes and glances at his sister.] We're your family now! \n",

      "AANG: [Sad and tired.] I'm sorry. \n",
      "KATARA: It's okay. It wasn't your fault. \n",
      "AANG: [Sadly.] But you were right. And if the firebenders found this temple, that means they found the other ones, too. [Close-up of his sad face, as he closes his eyes.] I really am the last airbender. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara hugs Aang tightly. The camera moves back and Sokka places a hand on Aang's shoulder. Switch to a shot of the statues inside the sanctuary.

      "KATARA: Everything's packed. You ready to go? \n",
      "AANG: [Closer shot of Aang and Katara's faces. Softly.] How is Roku supposed to help me if I can't talk to him? \n",
      "KATARA: Maybe you'll find a way. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They glance at each other when they hear something behind them. They turn around and see the flying lemur standing on its back legs in the middle of the doorway. Cut to a back view of the animal as it jumps to the right, toward where Sokka is standing. The animal reaches his feet and drops the load he was carrying: a variety of fruits. The lemur quickly dashes away as Sokka sits down and starts to stuff his face with the fruit, taking large bites of two different pieces of fruit.

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a wider shot. Sokka still stands there, mouth open and hand in front of his mouth, ready to take a bite, however, he has no peach anymore. The others start to laugh upon seeing Sokka's expression. Cut to a panoramic view of the Southern Air Temple at dusk; the camera slowly pans to the right. Cut to Aang, who is sadly staring back at it, leaning on the luggage that is tied at the back on Appa's saddle. Momo chitters quietly as they fly further away from the temple.

Cut to frontal shot of Zuko sitting peacefully with his eyes closed, the four candles in view, continually brightening and dimming. Cut to side-view shot of Zuko's head, the door to his cabin in view. Iroh cracks open the door and peeks through while Zuko opens his eyes. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Calmly.] The only reason you should be interrupting me, is if you have news about the Avatar. \n",
      "IROH: [Pushes open the door completely and enters the room, holding a rolled up scroll in his hands.] Well, there is news, Prince Zuko, but you might not like it. Don't get too upset. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Cut to shot of the prince sitting motionless, still assuming his meditative stance, his back to the camera. Calmly.] Uncle, you taught me that keeping a level head is a sign of a great leader. Now, whatever you have to say, I'm sure I can take it. \n",
      "IROH: [Frontal view of Zuko, Iroh tugging his small beard in the background.] Okay then. [Hesitatingly.] We have no idea where he is. \n",

      "ZUKO: [He snatches the scroll from Iroh's hand.] Give me the map! [He unrolls it, scanning over the parchment.] \n",
      "IROH: Well, there have been multiple sightings of the Avatar, but he is impossible to track down. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Desperately.] How am I going to find him, Uncle? [Cut to a shot of the map in Zuko's hand, several locations marked down with zigzagged lines connecting each point; Voice-over.] He is clearly a master of evasive maneuvering. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The shot of his map fades to a shot of the team's own map, minus the zigzagged lines, Sokka holding it in his hands. Cut to shot of him pouring over the map and questioning Aang's navigational skills. \n",

      "KATARA: [Looks over Aang and attempts to show enthusiasm.] That's great! \n",
      "AANG: [Dismayed.] But I'm not doing it now. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Cut to shot of Katara and Sokka seated on Appa's saddle. Sokka waves his arm breezily at Aang as if he is trying to shoo him away.] Stop bugging her, airhead. You need to give girls space when they do their sewing. \n",
      "KATARA: [Close side-view shot of Katara as she casts her brother an annoyed glare; irritably.] What does me being a girl have to do with sewing? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Cut to a shot of Sokka lazily resting with his arms behind his head.] Simple. Girls are better at fixing pants than guys and guys are better at hunting and fighting and stuff like that. [Cut back to an annoyed Katara.] It's just the natural order of things. \n",
      "KATARA: [Suddenly smiles. Sarcastically.] All done with your pants! [Shows that the pants are still ripped.] And look what a great job I did! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara angrily tosses the pants in his direction. Cut to shot of Sokka as the pair of pants hit him in the face, covering it. He quickly scrambles to free himself. \n",

Cut to an overview shot of an island covered with mountains. Switch to a far off shot of a beach, where Appa has landed and Team Avatar has dismounted. \n",
      "SOKKA: We just made a pit stop yesterday. Shouldn't we get a little more flying done before we camp out? \n",
      "KATARA: [Cut to close frontal view of Aang who is looking at something, his hand held against his brow. The siblings stand in the background.] He's right. At this rate, we won't get to the North Pole until spring. \n",
      "AANG: [Camera moves back to reveal Appa as well. Innocently.] But Appa's tired, aren't you boy? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa does not react at all apart from a mild grunt, which comes across less than convincing. \n",
      "AANG: [Nudges Appa against his front leg with his elbow.] I said, aren't you boy? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa puts slightly more enthusiasm behind his response the second time by grunting louder and opening up his mouth wide as if he was yawning. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Aang smiles over his shoulder at the duo. Sarcastically.] Yeah, that was real convincing.[Somewhat fearfully.] Still, hard to argue with a ten-ton magical monster. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to an overview shot of the bay.

      "AANG: [Excited.] That's why we're here. [Starts to disrobe while more koi fish jump out of the water in the background.] Elephant koi, and I'm gonna ride it. Katara, you've got to watch me! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a side-view of the coastline as Aang runs up and dives in. As soon as he submerges, he jumps out again. \n",
      "AANG: Cold! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Switch to Katara and Sokka, still standing on shore, they exchange glances while Appa walks away, clearly taking interest in something else. Sokka makes a circular motion with his left hand around near his left temple, signaling to his sister that he thinks Aang is crazy.

He dives under and immediately appears again, now holding on to the back fin of one of these giant animals as it jumps out of the water before diving again. Cut back to the siblings.

      "The shot switches to a close-up of Kyoshi's statue's wooden face as it is being repainted. The right side of her face is already done and the previous cracks are not visible anymore. The painter carefully reapplies her left eyebrow with black paint. A back view shot of the statue shows the main street of Kyoshi village with houses at both sides and one bigger house at the end of the street. Another villager is cleaning the back of the statue with a broom. The camera pans to the right until the big house becomes the center of the shot before cutting to a shot of Appa who lazily lies on his side, eating hay while two villagers are grooming him. He growls and chews while the camera pans the the left and up to focus on three open windows of the main house on the first floor. Cut to a side-view of inside the house where Aang, Katara, and Momo are sitting at a long table. A villager places another dish on the already richly filled table. Aang and Momo are very excited to see the display of decadent desserts in front of it, but Katara supports an uneasy look. \n",
      "AANG: [Throws his arms in the air while Momo digs in and chitters. Ecstatic.] All right! Dessert for breakfast! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara pokes one of the squishy looking, orange puffs with a flat top in front of her. Cut to a frontal view of the two as a doubtful Katara picks up and closely investigates the dessert she just pokes. Aang on the other hand does not share her reluctance and starts stuffing his face, two desserts at once. \n",
      "AANG: These people sure know [The rest is kind of muffled out because he is cramming his desserts in his mouth.] how to treat an Avatar! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara still is not convinced about the deliciousness of the dessert she is holding. Glances at Aang. \n",
      "AANG: [Impressed.] Mmm ... [Offers one of the desserts he is holding to Katara.] Katara you've got to try these! \n",
      "KATARA: [Puts down the orange dessert, accepts the dessert Aang offers her and takes a bit.] Well, maybe just a bite. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo sneaks up to Aang and snatches the dessert out of his other hand and quickly dashes away, who smiles at his pet. He does not let the theft bother him and quickly gabs another dessert in front of him while Katara munches down the piece of cake and reaches across the table for the same dessert Aang just took. Aang glances to his left, over the hunched Katara to Sokka. Momo appears between Aang and Katara and quickly snatches another cupcake from the table before vanishing underneath it. \n",
      "AANG: Sokka, what's your problem? Eat! \n",

      "SOKKA: Not hungry. \n",

      "KATARA: [Glancing amusingly at Aang. Slightly mocking.] He's just upset because a bunch of girls kicked his butt yesterday. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Protesting.] They snuck up on me! \n",
      "KATARA: [Mockingly looks at her brother.] Right. And then they kicked your butt. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a wider shot of the table. Momo is lying underneath the table with his front paws around a bunch a pastries he collected. He is chewing while Sokka angrily stands up in the background. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Indignant.] Sneak attacks don't count! [Walks out of the scene with big strides. Mumbling to himself.] Tie me up with ropes! I'll show them a thing or two. [Comes back to the table to face Katara and Aang. Momo grabs some more pastries that lie around him.] I'm not scared of any girls. [Snatches some of the desert of the table.] Who do they think they are anyway? [He shoves one of the deserts in his mouth and stalks off again.] Mmm ... this is tasty. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Front view of Aang and Katara. In the back villagers are still working on beautifying the statue of Kyoshi. Aang is still holding one of the sweets as the looks at Katara. \n",
      "AANG: What's he so angry about? [Excited.] It's great here. They're giving us the royal treatment! \n",
      "KATARA: Hey, don't get too comfortable. It's risky for us to stay in one place for very long. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo's arm comes into view from underneath the table. He scans the table for new pastries to snatch. \n",
      "AANG: [Lowers his arm with the pastry and offers it to Momo's grasping paw.] I'm sure we'll be fine. [The lemur feels the desert and quickly snatches it out of Aang's hand.] Besides, did you see how happy I'm making this town? [Aang moves closer to Katara and turns around to look out of the window at the statue.] They're even cleaning up that statue in my honor! \n",
      "KATARA: Well, it's nice to see you excited about being the Avatar. [Slightly concerned.] I just hope it doesn't all go to your head. \n",
      "AANG: [Reassuring.] Come on, you know me better than that. I'm just a simple monk. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang gets up and leans on the window sill so he can look better outside. As soon as he emerges, the villagers scream with delight and admiration for him. Aang looks down in surprise to see where the sound came from. The camera switches to his point of view and reveals a bunch a little girls cheering for him; Koko is among them in the front row. The camera cuts back to Aang who flashes a broad smile at the girls while blushing. Katara is standing behind him with her arms crossed in disapproval. She rolls her eyes and makes a raspberry.\n",
      "The shot changes to a side-view of a brownish-red bridge over a small creek. Aang quickly runs over it from the right to the left, trailed by four screaming fangirls. They run out of the picture, but Aang quickly comes back and traverses the bridge again, now from left to right. The girls are still following him, screaming loudly with the same amount of enthusiasm. They run out of the picture again, but once again, Aang runs back in. He runs up the bridge, but halts in the middle, looking from left to right as he sees that hordes of fangirls are trapping him on the bridge as they run up from both sides. Before they can reach him, the airbender leaps in the air. Cut to a closer shot of the girls in the middle of the bridge as they are still creaming and reaching for the sky. They gasp for air in admiration when they see that Aang is suspended in the air by clinging to an airball. The ball, however, slowly reduces in size until it vanishes completely. Aang looks scared as he drops down into the crowd of little girl who happily catch him.\n",
      "Switch to a shot of Aang and Koko standing serene with a waterfall in the background. A painter is measuring their proportions with his brush. Aang and Koko are obscured from sight as the artist raises his canvas and starts painting the outlines of Koko. \n",
      "PAINTER: [Muttering to himself.] Hmmm ... Painting the Avatar ... that's easy enough ... [He lowers the canvas and notices that another girl has pulled up next to Aang. Surprised.] Oh, there's another one ... [He obscures his models again from sight by raising his canvas and painting the outlines of the other girl.] Well, I'll make an adjustment here, and ... [He lowers the canvas to see that three more girls have joined Aang.] There's more ... [He obscures the Avatar and his fangirls from sight again with his canvas while he quickly paints Aang.] well that ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The painter lowers his canvas again and discovers that Aang is now surrounded by sixteen little girls. The camera switches to the annoyed face of the painter. As he stares at his models, his brush drips on his painting. Close shot of Aang and the fangirls as they all push and pull to be as close to Aang as possible. They are all smiling widely and giggling while Aang looks somewhat horrified by all the girls around him. A side-view of the scene shows that some girls are completely leaning on others in order to have a spot on the painting. The painter gets up and walks away without saying a word, while the tower of people crashes under its own weight.\n",
      "Switch to a shot of Aang and his fangirls back in the village. A frontal shot of the monk shows that he is doing push-ups while Momo is sitting on his back and his fangirls have lined up in a semi-circle behind him. After three push-ups, Aang starts to do one handed push-ups and soon switches to no handed push-ups, but pushing himself up with his airbending. The girls stare at him in admiration. Cut to a wider view as Katara walks past carrying a basket. A look of disapproval dons her face as she keeps on walking without even glancing at the Avatar.\n",

      "SOKKA: [Condescending.] Sorry ladies, [Suki and the other warriors stop their exercise and close their fans. They stare at Sokka with a serious look on their faces.] didn't mean to interrupt your dance lesson. [The camera moves back, revealing that Sokka was stretching.] I was just looking for somewhere to get a little workout? \n",
      "SUKI: [Looks at how Sokka continues his warm up.] Well, you're in the right place. [Cut to a side-view while Sokka is loosening up his hips.] Sorry about yesterday. I didn't know that you were friends with the Avatar. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Stretching his arms.] It's all right. [Mockingly suppressing a laugh while speaking.] I mean, normally I'd hold a grudge, but seeing as you guys are a bunch of girls, I'll make an exception. \n",
      "SUKI: [Sarcastically.] I should hope so. A big strong man like you? We wouldn't stand a chance. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Smugly.] True. But don't feel bad. After all, I'm the best warrior in my village. \n",
      "SUKI: [Keeps using sarcasm without Sokka catching on to it. Leans slightly toward Sokka.] Wow! Best warrior, huh? [Glances back to the other Kyoshi Warriors.] In your whole village? [Looks back to Sokka.] Maybe you'd be kind enough to give us a little demonstration. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Frontal view of Sokka as his eyes widen upon hearing the unexpected request.] Oh ... Well ... I mean ... I ... \n",
      "SUKI: [Turns to the other warriors.] Come on, girls! Wouldn't you like him to show us some moves? \n",

      "SOKKA: Well, if that's what you want, I'd be happy to. [He places his hands on Suki's shoulder in order to push her back a little, but she does not move a bit.] All right, you stand over there. Now, this may be a little tough, but try to block me. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: While he is talking, Sokka takes on a fighting stance while Suki has not moved a muscle from the position Sokka has put her in. Sokka bends through his knees and attacks the female warrior by trying to punch her. Suki does not move, but easily defends herself by bringing up her left arm and thrusting her closed fan against Sokka's shoulder. His cries out in pain and staggers backward. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Rubbing his hurt right shoulder. Impressed.] Aw! Heh heh ... Good. Of course, I was going easy on you. \n",
      "SUKI: [Close-up of Suki's confident face.] Of course. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a side-view. Sokka is clearly annoyed and angered by Suki's arrogant facial expression. \n",
      "SOKKA: [He starts with a mumble, raising his tone of voice with each word.] Let's see if you can [Shouting while he attempts to hit Suki with a roundhouse kick.] handle this! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Suki quickly dodges under Sokka's outstretched leg and pushes him off balance. When the Water Tribe warrior lands flat on his back with a loud thud, Suki lazily opens her fans to wave herself some air. Sokka, a little shocked by his second failure, loses his temper at the sight of Suki's defiant posture. \n",
      "SOKKA: [His voice cracking in anger.] That does it! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He gets up and madly charges her again. Suki quickly closes her fan and moves out of Sokka's way. She grabs him by the arm with her right hand, while she pushes against his shoulder with her left hand, quickly spinning him around. After two turns, she switches position and spins Sokka in the other direction. Close-up of Sokka's distressed face as he is powerlessly being tossed around. Switch to a wider shot as Suki suddenly halts Sokka so he topples forward. Before falling down, Suki loosens Sokka's belt and ties his left hand to his right foot behind his back in one swift movement. Sokka tries so maintain his balance for a while by jumping on one leg, but it is not long before he loses footage and smacks down flat on his face. \n",

      "KATARA: [Turns around in surprise, but is happy to see that the poke came from Aang.] Oh, good! Can you help me carry this back to the room? [She moves the pot toward Aang.] It's a little heavy. \n",
      "AANG: [Holding up his hands to fob off with the offered pot.] Actually, I can't right now. \n",
      "KATARA: [Slightly irritated.] What do you mean, \"you can't?\" \n",
      "AANG: I promised the girls I'd give them a ride on Appa. Why don't you come with us? It'll be fun! \n",
      "KATARA: [Resumed filling the pot with more vegetables.] Watching you show off for a bunch of girls does not sound like fun. \n",
      "AANG: [Disappointed.] Well, neither does carrying your basket. \n",
      "KATARA: [Annoyed.] It's not my basket. These supplies are for our trip. I told you, we have to leave Kyoshi soon. \n",
      "AANG: [Central focus on Aang.] I don't want to leave Kyoshi yet. I can't put my finger on it, [He puts his hand to his chin in a thinking posture; the camera pans to the right, showing Aang's fangirls better in the background.] but there's something I really like about this place. \n",

      "AANG: It didn't. You know what I think? You just don't want to come because you're jealous. \n",
      "KATARA: [Close-up; angrily.] Jealous? [More high pitched voice.] Of what? \n",

Suddenly Aang is swept away by a wave and lifted out of the water, while he is screaming in panic. He looks around to find himself sitting on the back of Unagi as the monstrous eel erects itself before him, and directs a powerful jet of water to him.

He emerges back to the surface, clearly unconscious with his tongue out of his mouth. The camera pans up to show a heavily panting and fully clothed Katara entering the water. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Unagi shrieks and dives under to get to his unconscious prey. Close-up of a worried Katara who is moving toward Aang through the water as fast as she can. The camera switches between shots of a rapidly approaching shadow underneath the water of Unagi, and a heavily panting Katara in her frantic effort to reach Aang before the eel. The moment Katara reaches Aang and takes him into her arm, Unagi emerges right in front of them. In an attempt to get away, Katara violently pushes the water, propelling herself and Aang backward with her waterbending; at the same time, Unagi snatches the water where they were just moments before. Although missing the duo, the impact of Unagi's attack creates a giant wave that slams Katara and Aang back to the rocks on shore. Angered, the animal spews power streams of water to the rocks before submerging again. \n",
      "KATARA: [Carefully peeking over the rock.] Zuko! \n",

Switch to a scene of the sky that quickly pans down to reveal how Zuko and his man ride past Katara and Aang's hiding place.

When she is certain the riders have past, Katara lays Aang on his back. \n",
      "KATARA: [Worriedly.] Wake up, Aang! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She looks around for a while before starting to move her left hand over his chest, while supporting his head with her right. She moves her hand from his chest to his mouth, and bends out the water he had swallowed. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to an outside shot of the Kyoshi Warriors' dojo. Inside Suki and Sokka are still training. Momo is hanging by his tail on one of the support beams of the roof.

A Kyoshi Warriors lands in front of the lead rhino and opens her fans. The rider stabs at her with his spear. She moves to the right, disarms the rider, and jumps up to knock him off his steed with a spinning kick. Suki can be seen running past in the background.\n",
      "Cut to a frontal view of a concentrated Suki while she runs toward Zuko. Switch to a back view of Suki, who moves to the left to avoid a fire blast of the prince. She jumps over another blast and tries to attack Zuko from the air, but he turns his rhino. The beast slams Suki away with a might sweep of his tail, knocking her down. Zuko shoots a fire blast at the downed warrior, but right before it would have burned her, Sokka jumps before her and decimates the flames with a sweep of his fan. Sokka prepares to fight Zuko, but before he can do anything, another Kyoshi Warrior jumps of a nearby roof and knocks a surprised Zuko of his rhino; the beast dashes away. \n",

The camera moves back to reveal how Sokka, Suki, and the other Kyoshi Warrior all take on a fighting stance. Zuko pushes himself up and rapidly spins around on his hand while shooting fire out of his feet, knocking the Kyoshi Warrior back into the house and slamming Suki against a wooden pole, where she collapses in pain. Zuko proceeds with a low fire kick in Sokka's direction. The Water Tribe Warrior jumps over the fire, but as soon as he lands again, Zuko sweeps his feet from underneath him. Sokka falls in his back, and Zuko jumps over him to the middle of the street. He angrily looks around. Camera moves back to reveal the completely deserted street. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko commences by sending two fire balls in Aang's direction. Back view of Aang as he prepares to face the incoming, burning projectiles. He ducks underneath the first and uses his staff to decimate the next fire ball. He rapidly spins the staff over his head, propelling himself in the air. He lands in front of Zuko, who immediately kicks the staff out of his hands. Aang jumps up and lands between two fans of a Kyoshi Warrior that are lying on the ground. He stands up and picks us the fan with his airbending. Close-up of Zuko, who madly charges Aang with his fist already held stretched out before him. Aang spins around a few times to create a bigger momentum and uses the extra power of his swirl to blast Zuko in a nearby house with a strong blast of air. Aang looks sad and lowers the fans. He runs down the main street and picks up his staff along the way. Aang tosses the object in the air, where it snaps open into his glider and jumps on. A close-up of a saddened Aang, switches to the scene he is seeing: a lot of burning houses and the Fire Nation troops among them. Aang looks back to see the burning statue of Avatar Kyoshi, which saddens Aang even more.\n",

      "KATARA: Then let's get out of here. Zuko will leave Kyoshi to follow us. I know it feels wrong to run, but I think it's the only way. \n",
      "AANG: [Sad.] I'll call Appa. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a Kyoshi Warrior who deflects a fire blast with her fan, and retaliates by throwing her other closed fan to the firebender. With a load clung, the object makes contact with the bender's helmet, knocking him on his behind. The camera moves backward through an ally. Two retreating Warriors can be soon, deflecting fire balls left and right, before the camera pans to the left, revealing Sokka and Suki squatting behind a house. \n",
      "SUKI: There's no time to say goodbye. \n",
      "SOKKA: What about, \"I'm sorry?\" \n",

      "SUKI: [Side-view.] I am a warrior. [She leans over and kisses Sokka on the cheek, before continuing again. A surprised Sokka touches his cheek where Suki just kissed him.] But I'm a girl, too.

      "KATARA: [Peeking over the rim of the saddle to address a saddened Aang. Sokka is wiping of the face paint with his sleeve.] I know it's hard, but you did the right thing. [Gesturing toward the town.] Zuko would have destroyed the whole place if we had stayed. [Comforting.] They're going to be okay, Aang. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang looks up with a determined look on his face. The camera zooms in on him, when he suddenly jumps off Appa, the camera following his free fall. \n",

Cut back to a shot of the surface, where a few ripples betray the nearing emerging of something. The water bubbles and suddenly Unagi shoots out of the water with Aang on top of his head, holding his whiskers. After swaying about a few times, he sturdies himself atop Unagi's head and pulls the creature's barbels. Unagi opens its mouth wide and begins gushing water which rains over the town. Cut to shot of the village houses as the fires are put out by the rain. Cut to shot of a drenched Zuko and his men mounted on the rhinos, Zuko looking angered and his men looking surprised.

      "SOKKA: [Somewhat seriously.] You need a disguise. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Closer shot of the talking guard as he squishes the cabbage he is holding and knocks another two cabbages out of the merchant's hands. He proceeds by earthbending a rock under the cart, catapulting it high in the air, making it tumble down the chasm with all the cabbages. \n",
      "CABBAGE.MERCHANT: [Leaning over the rim of the path. Dramatically waving his arms in despair.] No! My cabbages! \n",

      "AANG: [Close-up, broadly smiling; somewhat nervously.] Just keep smiling! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: While Aang walks over to the guards, Katara and Sokka give each other an uneasy look. Katara flashes her teeth in an awkward way and chuckles uncomfortably, while Sokka merely raises a doubtful eyebrow. Side-view as Aang approaches the sentries at the gate. The earthbender steps to the front and raises a boulder out of the ground before Aang and levitates it above his head. \n",
      "GATE.GUARD: [Aggressively with a glare.] State your business! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang quickly runs from underneath the boulder and toward the guard; he halts right in front of the surprised man. \n",

[Close-up of the guard, taken aback by the threateningly pointing finger just centimeters from his face.] I've got half a mind to [Close-up of Sokka, eyes and mouth wide open in shock at Aang's audacity to talk to the sentry like that, and Katara, shaking her head with eyes wide open in shock.] bend you over my knee and paddle your backside! \n",
      "GATE.GUARD: [In a calmer voice.] Settle down, old timer! Just tell me who you are. \n",
      "AANG: [Sokka and Katara are still in shock in the background; in old man voice.] Name's Bonzu Pippinpaddleopsicopolis, the Third, [Sokka raises a questioningly eyebrow while Katara walks up, smiling friendly.] and these are my grandkids. \n",

They walk through as the walls already start to move again to close right after them. A back view of Aang as he walks through the opened gates, when suddenly Momo's ears pop out of his wig. Close-up of the guard that granted them entrance, as his eyes widen in surprise. He tries to keep an eye on Aang as long as he can, but the airbender is obscured from his view by the closing gates.\n",

Closer shot of Sokka and Katara, excitedly taking in the city spread out before them as Aang pulls up next to them, Momo's head now entirely popped out of his wig. He leans on the rim as well and joins the siblings in mouth open gazing at Omashu's scenery. Cut to a shot of the streets filled with people. The camera pans up, revealing an intricate system of chutes. The aqueduct like structures are built over and beside the houses with typical green roofs. \n",

As the cart passed one earthbender, he uses his bending to change the cart's directing and pushes it to the front, where another earthbender bends it up a tube to two other earthbenders standing at the ready to receive it. One earthbender quickly bends stone lintels underneath the cart so it would not fall down again, while the other one thrusts it off the platform, where it slides down a chute at high speed. \n",

Camera shifts to the Water Tribe siblings, Katara screaming in fear, Sokka gritting his teeth in terror. Camera moves back as the cart makes a turn, and follows it down the slope. The chute they are riding pulls up next to a parallel one, where a cart with a rack of six spears is racing down. Switch to a side-view as the cart of the trio pulls up next to the cart with the spears and they all stare at it, no one making a sound. They race past it and both tracks join together. Sokka and Katara scream as the two chutes merge into one chute with the spear-cart behind them, but quickly gaining. Sokka hears it coming and turn around. He gasps and ducks just in time to avoid being skewered by the spears. Katara turns around, and screams in fear as she sees the weapons so close. Aang, smiling excitedly, turns as well to see what the commotion is all about. \n",

The scene freezes for a second at that shot as the sound of a little bell can be heard, before continuing. The warriors gasp in surprise as the cart ricochets and continues moving. Switch to a scene of other carts moving over a chute. The cart with the trio breaks through the railing closing off the other chute and crosses the track, knocking over one of the supply carts, spilling a load of pumpkins all over the ground.

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang airbends behind him. They pass by a restaurant, where a couple is eating together. They look up in surprise at the kids flashing by while the waiter dashes over to see what is going on. The scene switches to an earthbender soldier waiting for the arrival of the next cart. As a cart of scrolls stops in front of him, the camera tilts to the right, showing how the cart with the trio is flying down an incredibly steep slope. As the slope flattens out, the kids cry out in alarm as they are moments from colliding with the motionless cart in front of the bender. The earthbender on duty at that station sends it on its way, briefly relieving the trio in the speeding cart. Much to the riders' horror, another cart instantly pops up from the tube below the bender. Before it can be moved, the kids' cart crashes into it, catapulting them and their cart into the air, high above a lower level of the city. Aang airbends the cart in front of them as they fall, making them drop back into the cart. The kids ride down several roofs, leaving damaged tiles in their wake. The scene switches to inside a craftsman's home, where he whistles serenely as he puts the final touches on a vase. The cart flies through one window, ricochets off of the floor where the vase is, smashing it and making the riders grunt, and flying out the window opposite. The craftsman peers out the ruined window as a dust cloud emerges, revealing that the cart has crashed against something else. \n",
      "AANG: Sorry! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They land on a balcony and slide through another house. Emerging on the other side, a bearded cat chases Momo around Aang's wig until the lemur pushes it off. The cart smashes through a parapet and drops vertically out of sight. The view changes to the same cabbage merchant that had his cabbage cart thrown into the abyss earlier, now cuddling a cabbage at a replacement cart. Alerted by something coming from up above, he walks from underneath the cart's roof to check it out, and gasps in horror as the kids' cart drops on it, smashing the replacement cart to pieces and scattering what intact cabbages are left all over. Aang, Katara, and Sokka are in a tangled heap by the remains, while Momo elegantly floats down. \n",
      "CABBAGE.MERCHANT: [Grasping his head in despair.] My cabbages! [Angrily.] You're gonna pay for this! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Guards walk up, surrounding the still dazed trio. Close-up of Aang as he sits up, his disguise pretty much gone, revealing his youthful face and airbending arrow. \n",
      "AANG: [Sheepishly.] Two cabbages please. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene fades to the ceiling of the palace of Omashu. The camera pans down, revealing a watch guard in the front, and the King of Omashu sitting on his throne, flanked by two guards, in the back of an enormous room. The first watch guard slightly moves aside to let the three children pass. Sokka looks very uneasy, Katara slants her eyes up in an attempt to look sympathetic, and glances to the side. As she gazes at the king, the scene switches to a close-up of the elderly king, who looks at them questioningly, arching an eyebrow and grunting in wonder. The scene switches to a frontal view of the \"visitors\" as they are being pushed into a kneeling position by two guards. \n",
      "GUARD: Your majesty, these juveniles were arrested for vandalism, traveling under false pretenses, and malicious destruction of cabbages. \n",
      "CABBAGE.MERCHANT: [Jumping agitatedly up and down, waving his left fist in the air.] Off with their heads! One for each head of cabbage! \n",
      "GUARD: [Gesturing at the merchant.] Silence! Only the king can pass down judgment. What is your judgment, sire? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera slowly moves in on the king who squints his eyes and grunts pensively. Switch to a close-up of the trio, who uneasily eye each other. A close-up of a whimpering Sokka, moves to one of a smiling Katara, her hands folded in front of her and her eyes twinkling hopefully. Aang is the only one who keeps staring at the side, one eyebrow arched and pouting. Switch to a close-up of the dissimilar eyes of the elderly king, before going back to a shot of Aang who now whistles nonchalantly. \n",
      "BUMI: [Raising his hand.] Throw them ... [Sokka, Katara, and Aang gasp.] a feast! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The guard gasps and the merchant grasps his head with both hands in dismay upon hearing the king's verdict. Sokka is smiling, while Katara darts a questioningly look toward Aang, who arches his eyebrows in wonder. Cut to a richly-filled dining table. The camera pans to the right, revealing all sorts of different dishes and teapots. Camera zooms in on Momo as he eats a lot of the food, chittering contently. Switch to a frontal view of the children sitting at the table, the king standing behind their chairs. \n",
      "BUMI: [To Aang.] The people in my city have gotten fat from too many feasts, [Leaning in over Aang, grabbing the chicken leg that is on his plate, holding it in front of him.] so I hope you like your chicken with no skin. \n",
      "AANG: Thanks, but I don't eat meat. \n",
      "BUMI: [To Sokka.] How about you? I bet you like meat. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Bumi stuffs the chicken into Sokka's mouth, who eats it appreciatively, and walks over to his own seat. \n",
      "KATARA: [Quietly to Aang.] Is it just me, or [Turns circles with her index finger beside her temple, implying the king is crazy.] is this guy's crown a little crooked? \n",
      "BUMI: [Aerial shot of the dining table as Bumi pulls up to his seat.] So tell me, young bald one, [Sitting down.] where are you from? \n",
      "AANG: [Close-up.] I'm from ... Kangaroo Island! \n",
      "BUMI: [Cut to the King, two guards standing watch behind him.] Oh, Kangaroo Island, eh? I hear that place is really hopping! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A moment of silence occurs, someone coughs off camera. Cut to a frontal shot of the three children, looking straight at the king with blank faces. Sokka bursts out laughing. Katara and Aang look at him, still with a blank expression. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Stops laughing; unsure.] What? It was pretty funny. \n",
      "BUMI: [Cut back to the king, who lazily stretches his arms, and yawns.] Well, all these good jokes are making me tired. Guess it's time to hit the hay. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Bumi eyes the children with a weird expression as he leans to the left on his chair. Suddenly, he hurls a chicken leg at them. Close-up of the meat as it flies through the air. Cut to a side shot of the three children, as Aang nearly tumbles off his chair in reflex of catching the chicken leg in a small airball. Switch to guards gasping in surprise. Cut to a side shot of the entire table. Aang is still suspending the chicken leg in the airball. \n",
      "BUMI: [Gesturing at Aang.] There's an airbender in our presence, and not just any airbender. [Close-up as he decisively stands up.] The Avatar! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Close-up of a shocked Aang, who quickly stops bending and puts his hands behind his back. The chicken leg falls on his plate. Back shot of the three children, as Bumi continues. \n",
      "BUMI: [Sits down again.] Now, what do you have to say for yourself, [Close-up, smiling satisfied.] Mr. Pippinpaddleopsicopolis? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Camera fades to black before cutting to a frontal shot of the entire city of Omashu. Cut back to an overview shot from inside the dining room from behind Aang, Katara, and Sokka. Momo is still sitting in the middle of the table, eating. \n",
      "AANG: [Standing up, throwing his hands in the air.] Okay, you caught me. [Frontal shot of the three friends.] I'm the Avatar. Doing my Avatar thing, keeping the world safe. Everything checks out. [Aang looks underneath table.] No firebenders here. So, good work, everybody! [Pulling Katara and Sokka into a hug.] Love each other, [Cut to a dismayed looking king.] respect all life, [Cut to a shot of the threesome walking backward toward the exit.] and don't run with your spears. We'll see you next time! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As they near the guard at the exit door, the two men cross their spears, effectively blocking their paths. Camera zooms back to a back shot of the king. \n",
      "KATARA: [Accusingly.] You can't keep us here! Let us leave! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Frontal shot of the king as he questioningly picks up a lettuce leaf from his plate and waves it in the air. \n",
      "BUMI: Lettuce leaf? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Switch to a side shot of Bumi's mouth as he takes a bite out of a lettuce leaf and chews it slowly. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Cut to the threesome. Sokka holds his hand for his mouth; whispering.] We're in serious trouble. This guy is nuts. \n",
      "BUMI: [Close-up.] Tomorrow, the Avatar will [Slowly zooming in close-up of Aang.] face three deadly challenges. [Back to Bumi.] But for now, the guards will show you to your chamber. \n",
      "CHAMBERLAIN: [Leaning in toward Bumi.] My liege, do you mean the good chamber or the bad chamber? \n",
      "BUMI: [Turning to the guard.] The newly refurbished chamber. \n",
      "CHAMBERLAIN: [Putting finger in the air.] Wait, which one are we talking about? \n",
      "BUMI: The one that used to be the bad chamber, until the recent refurbishing, that is. Of course, we've been calling it the new chamber, but we really should number them. [Switch to a frontal shot of the three children as they are being led out of the room, flanked by two guards. Commanding.] Uh, take them to the refurbished chamber that was once bad! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As the children and their guards walk out of the room, the camera rapidly zooms in on Bumi's face. He stares at them before chewing on a new lettuce leaf. The scene changes to inside a room. A wall cracks and moves down, revealing Aang with Momo perched on his shoulders, Katara, and Sokka. They are roughly pushed inside, and the wall is immediately bent up again after them. Switch to a scene of the room, panning to the left, revealing the content of the room, and the fact that there is no door anywhere. The room has three green beds in the center with three green drapes hanging from the ceiling above them. The scene stops on the children. \n",
      "KATARA: This is a prison cell? But it's so nice. \n",
      "AANG: [Momo jumps off Aang's shoulders and onto a bed.] He did say it was newly refurbished. \n",
      "SOKKA: Nice or not, we're prisoners! \n",
      "AANG: [Close-up; worried.] I wonder what these challenges are gonna to be. \n",
      "KATARA: [Determined.] We're not sticking around to find out. There's got to be some way out of here. \n",
      "AANG: [Excitedly pointing at something at the other side of the room.] The air vents! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene quickly moves around the room and halts at a hole in the wall. Cut back to the trio. Aang smiles happily, staring at the hole, while Katara and Sokka eye each other in wonder. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Harshly.] If you think we're going to fit through there, you're crazier than that king. \n",
      "AANG: [Turning to Sokka.] We can't, but Momo can! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Happily points in front of him. Cut to Momo lazily lying on the bed, licking a half-eaten apple. His belly protrudes from eating so much. Aang appears at the side of the bed. \n",
      "AANG: [Hopeful.] Momo, I need you to find Appa and bust us outta here! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo looks up surprised to his friend, blinking and chittering softly. Cut to a shot from inside the air vent looking out. Momo's head appears and the animal is pushed inside the tube. The animal is shoved back and forth a few times, much to its displeasure. Cut to Aang standing on a chair, trying to push Momo into the air vent without success. \n",
      "AANG: Go on, boy, get Appa! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang quits trying, looking down discouraged, leaving Momo stuck in the vent. Cut to Sokka who is relaxing on a bed. \n",
      "SOKKA: Eh, how was Appa supposed to save us anyway? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Momo trying to free himself by pushing against the wall with his hind legs. \n",
      "AANG: [Voice-over.] Appa's a ten-ton flying bison; I think he could figure something out. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo was unsuccessful and gives up, his hind legs hanging down in defeat. Cut to an overview shot of the three beds. \n",
      "KATARA: [Climbing into her bed.] Well, no point arguing about it now. Get some rest, Aang. [Aang walks toward his bed.] Looks like you'll need it for tomorrow. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang sadly sits on the side of his bed, looking down. Switch to the next scene of Aang lying on his bed, snoring loudly and drooling on his pillow. The room is only dimly lit, casting a somewhat green glow. The wall behind Aang opens, revealing a guard. The crunching sound of the earth being moved wakes Aang, who quickly raises his head and glances around. \n",
      "AANG: [Alarmed.] Sokka? [Switch to Aang's point of view; the other beds are empty.] Katara? [Frontal shot as Aang turns toward the guard.] Where are my friends? \n",
      "GUARD: [Frontal shot.] The king will free them if you complete your challenges. \n",
      "AANG: [Frontal shot; unsure.] And if I fail? \n",
      "GUARD: [Frontal shot.] He didn't say. [Extending his arm; switch back to a shot of the guard.] Your staff, please? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang lifts his staff with his foot, grabs it, and spins it around, places it upright next to him, before tossing it to the guard. Switch to a frontal shot of Aang, flanked by two guards, entering the large throne room. The scene slightly pans to the left, showing a bit of King Bumi's back. \n",
      "BUMI: [Serious.] First, Avatar, [Frontal shot as Bumi spread his arms, showing off his purple outfit; lighthearted.] what do you think of my new outfit? I want your honest opinion. [Frontal shot of Aang who blankly stares at the king. Someone coughs during the ensuing silence. Switch back to a frontal shot of Bumi.] I'm waiting. \n",
      "AANG: [Scratching his head.] I ... guess it's fine. \n",
      "BUMI: Excellent! You passed the first test. \n",
      "AANG: Really? \n",
      "BUMI: [Upbeat.] Well, not one of the deadly tests. [Waving his finger from side to side, emphasizing his words.] The real challenges are much more, uh, challenging. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a side shot of Aang as he suddenly dashes forward to the surprise of his two guards. Using his airbending, his speed is enhanced. Close-up of his feet as he quickly crosses the distance between him and King Bumi. Cut to a back shot of Bumi as Aang halts in front of him, the wind passing over them. \n",
      "AANG: [Aggressively.] I don't have time for your crazy games! [Close-up of King Bumi.] Give me my friends back! We're leaving! \n",
      "BUMI: Oh, I thought you might refuse, [Side shot of the two. A wall opens, revealing Katara and Sokka struggling in the grasp of a guard. Aang turns to them.] so I will give your friends some special souvenirs. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang looks back at Bumi. Cut to a frightened Katara as her guard slides a green ring over her finger. Close-up of the ring being put on. The moment the guard retracts his hand, the ring glows and tightens around her finger. The scene broadens, showing Sokka has gotten a ring as well, his being blue, and is now frantically trying to remove it from his finger. Katara tries to pull it off as well, both are unsuccessful. \n",
      "BUMI: [Voice-over.] Those delightful rings are made of pure jennamite, also known as creeping crystal. It's a crystal that grows remarkably fast. [Close-up of Bumi; sinister.] By nightfall your friends will be completely covered in it. [Slightly sympathetic.] Terrible thing, really. [Serious.] I can stop it, but only if you cooperate. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Bumi glances toward the siblings. Cut to a shot of Sokka's finger now donning a blue jennamite ring. The ring glows and expands toward his hand. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Panicking.] Ah! It's already creeping! \n",
      "AANG: [Cut back to a side shot of Aang and Bumi; serious.] I'll do what you want. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Close-up of an evil grinning Bumi. Scene changes to a cave filled with stalagmites and stalactites. Camera pans to the left where Aang stands on a flat rock with a waterfall in front of him. In the waterfall, there is a ladder, and above the ladder hangs a rope. Sokka, Katara, and Bumi are on a balcony cut into the wall to the left of the waterfall. King Bumi is laughing. Cut to a frontal shot of the king looking over the balcony rim. Katara and Sokka are guarded behind him. The jennamite ring has already expanded to engulf part of their right forearm. Bumi glances back at the siblings with a grin on his face. Close-up of the jennamite as it glows and creeps a bit further on the arms of Sokka and Katara. Switch to a back shot of Bumi as he is looking out toward where Aang is standing. \n",
      "BUMI: It seems I've lost my lunch box key and I'm hungry. Ooh, there it is! [Bumi points to inside the waterfall.] Would you mind fetching it for me? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The key hanging from a chain and a vertical iron ladder are dimly visible behind the waterfall. Aang airbends to the base of the fall and plunges into the waterfall. He manages to climb up the rock face to the base of the ladder and grasp it with one hand. Before he can get any further, the torrent of water pushes him away and out. \n",
      "BUMI: [Sarcastically.] Ooh, climbing the ladder. No one's ever done that before. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Panting, Aang rests a moment between two stalagmites, leaps from them to the stalactites above, and closer to the waterfall still high by the roof of the cavern. He dives into the fall above the key and tries to grab the key as he falls with the water; the rush of the water carries him past and in a moment he shoots out again, keyless. \n",
      "BUMI: That's right. Keep diving head in. I'm sure it'll work eventually. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang cuts a stalagmite with airbending and throws it like a spear at the key, accelerating it with another air blast. The stone spear snags the chain suspending the key, and carries it out of the waterfall. The spear pierces the stone wall above the King's balcony, the key now dangling right in front of Bumi. \n",
      "AANG: There! Enjoy your lunch! I want my friends back now! \n",
      "BUMI: Ah, not yet. I need help with another matter. It seems I've lost my pet, Flopsie. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to Aang in a large sunken enclosure in a new room, with Bumi, Katara, and Sokka up above. Aang finds a lop-eared bunny. \n",
      "AANG: Okay! Found him! \n",
      "BUMI: Bring him to me. Daddy wants a kiss from Flopsie! \n",
      "AANG: Come here, Flopsie. [Flopsie jumps down behind Aang, startling both him and the bunny.] Huh? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Squealing with terror, the bunny bolts across the arena with Aang in pursuit until it goes into a hole. Aang puts his arm in the hole up to the shoulder trying to grab hold of the frightened rabbit. The light dawns on his face. \n",
      "AANG: Flopsie, wait! Flopsie! [Cut to Bumi laughing. Back to Aang chasing the bunny.] Flopsie! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang puts his arm in the hole up to the shoulder trying to grab hold of the frightened rabbit. The light dawns on his face. The snarling goat gorilla bounds toward Aang but instead of attacking, picks him up and licks him. \n",
      "AANG: Wait a minute. [Close-up of Flopsie snarling. Cut to behind Aang.] Flopsie? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The snarling goat gorilla bounds toward Aang but instead of attacking, picks him up and licks him. \n",
      "AANG: Flopsie! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Flopsie puts Aang down and, obeying a whistle from the king, climbs up from the arena to him and rolls onto his back, offering his belly. \n",
      "BUMI: [Rubbing Flopsie's belly.] Oh, that's a good boy. Yes, who has a soft belly? \n",
      "AANG: [Aang jumps up to where Katara and Sokka. Both are encased in crystal to their shoulders.] Guys, are you okay? \n",
      "KATARA: Other than the crystals slowly encasing my entire body, doing great! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: At that moment, a crystal grows on one side of Sokka's body, making him become unbalanced and fall. Aang walks over to Bumi. \n",
      "BUMI: [Rubbing Flopsie's belly.] Oh, yes. \n",
      "AANG: Come on! I'm ready for the next challenge. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The king gives an evil laugh and the scene dissolves to an earthbending arena. Aang and the king are on a balcony overlooking the arena, Sokka and Katara along with a guard are on an adjacent balcony. The crystals are past their heads, leaving their faces exposed. \n",
      "BUMI: Your final test is a duel. And as a special treat, you may choose your opponent. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Two tough-looking men come out, standing next to the king. Aang looks at them uncertainly. \n",
      "BUMI: Point and choose. \n",
      "AANG: So ... you're saying whoever I point to, that's the person I get to fight? \n",
      "BUMI: Choose wisely! \n",
      "AANG: I ... choose ... you. [Aang points to the king.] \n",
      "BUMI: Wrong choice! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The king straightens up and removes his outer robe, proving himself to be a powerfully built old man. He earthbends Aang off of the balcony, making him fly into the arena. The king jumps down right in front of Aang, and laughs. \n",
      "BUMI: You thought I was a frail old man, but I'm the most powerful earthbender you'll ever see. \n",
      "AANG: Can I fight the guy with the axe instead? \n",
      "BUMI: There are no take-backsies in my kingdom. You might need this. [Points to the guard standing near Katara and Sokka.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The guard tosses Aang his staff. The king bends several rocks at Aang who just avoids and evades the attacks. \n",
      "BUMI: Typical airbender tactic: avoid and evade. I hoped the Avatar would be less predictable. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The king attacks Aang some more. Aang just keeps avoiding and evading. \n",
      "BUMI: Don't you have any surprises for me? Sooner or later you'll have to strike back! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang uses his staff to helicopter into the air. The king bends a large boulder into the ceiling, raining rocks onto Aang, knocking him from the air. He charges at the king on foot, but a series of bending attacks leaves him flat atop a large rock pile \n",
      "BUMI: You'll have to be a little more creative than that! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang bends an air scooter and charges forward on it, throwing a huge air blast at the king as he comes. The king throws up a stone barrier and the blast deflects to both sides of it. \n",
      "BUMI: Did someone leave the windows open? It feels a little drafty in here. Are you hoping I'll catch a cold? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The king bends more attacks at Aang, leading him across half of the arena. \n",
      "BUMI: How are you going to get me from way over there? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang charges forward on foot again, using airbending to accelerate but the king softens the arena floor, leaving him sunk to the waist. The king bends two stones to collide on the spot but Aang pops out at the top of them when they meet. Visibly angry now, he bends the slab the king is standing on all the way to the back of the arena. The king bends the largest boulder yet to come at Aang from behind but he does an air-assisted back flip over it. The king makes more bending moves, cracking the floors and walls of the arena, tearing out a huge chunk of the wall and balcony they had been standing on. Seeing what is coming, Aang gasps and runs in tight circles, conjuring a tornado. When the king flings the huge piece at Aang, it is caught in the tornado and instantly whips around right back at the king. The king bends it to sand before it can smash him, but before he can recover, Aang attacks from the top of the tornado, landing at the king's feet with his staff poised to strike. The king's arms are raised as if surrendering but a small pebble strikes Aang's head, drawing his attention to the large boulder suspended over the both of them. \n",
      "BUMI: Well done, Avatar. You fight with much fire in your heart. [He tosses the boulder aside and bends up to the balcony where the two siblings are almost completely encased. Aang joins him.] You've passed all my tests. Now, you must answer one question. \n",
      "AANG: That's not fair! You said you would release my friends if I finished your tests. \n",
      "BUMI: Oh, but what's the point of tests if you don't learn anything? \n",
      "SOKKA: Oh, come on! \n",
      "BUMI: Answer this one question and I will set your friends free. What ... is my name? From the looks of your friends I'd say you only have a few minutes. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Bumi walks out of frame. Aang confers with Katara and Sokka. \n",
      "AANG: How am I supposed to know his name? \n",
      "KATARA: Think about the challenges. Maybe it's some kind of riddle. \n",
      "SOKKA: I got it! \n",
      "AANG: Yeah? \n",
      "SOKKA: He's an earthbender, right? Rocky. You know, because of all the rocks. \n",
      "KATARA: We're going to keep trying, but that is a good back-up. \n",
      "AANG: Okay. So back to the challenges. I got a key from the waterfall, I saved his pet, and I had a duel. \n",
      "KATARA: And what did you learn? \n",
      "AANG: Well, everything was different than I expected. \n",
      "KATARA: [The jennamite grows as she talks with anxiety.] And? \n",
      "AANG: Well, they weren't straight forward. To solve each test, I had to think differently than I usually would. I know his name. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Aang confronting Bumi. \n",
      "AANG: I solved the question the same way I solved the challenges. As you said a long time ago, I had to open my brain to the possibilities. [The king laughs with the same odd snort Bumi did a hundred years ago.] Bumi, you're a mad genius. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang and Bumi hug like old friends. \n",
      "BUMI: Oh Aang, it's good to see you. You haven't changed a bit. Literally. \n",
      "KATARA: Uh, over here! \n",
      "SOKKA: Little help? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Bumi breaks the crystals using earthbending, making pieces fly everywhere. He catches one of them. \n",
      "BUMI: Jennamite is made of rock candy. [He takes a bite into the crystal.] Delicious! \n",
      "KATARA: So this crazy king is your old friend Bumi? \n",
      "BUMI: Who are you calling old? Okay, I'm old. \n",
      "SOKKA: Why did you do all of this instead of just telling Aang who you were? \n",
      "BUMI: First of all, it's pretty fun messing with people. [Snorts.] But I do have a reason. Aang, you have a difficult task ahead. The world has changed in the hundred years that you've been gone. It's the duty of the Avatar to restore balance to the world by defeating Fire Lord Ozai. You have much to learn. You must master the four elements and confront the Fire Lord. And when you do, I hope you will think like a mad genius. And it looks like you're in good hands. You'll need your friends to help defeat the Fire Nation. [Momo climbs up on Aang.] And you'll need Momo, too. \n",
      "AANG: Thank you for your wisdom, but before we leave, I have a challenge for you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to show Bumi and Aang riding down the mail system. Cut to view of the entire city. A cloud of dust is raised as a crash is heard. \n",
      "CABBAGE.MERCHANT: My cabbages! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene opens up in a forest. Katara and Aang are on a raised, grassy plateau. A gentle stream is running out beneath it. Katara is folding one of their sleeping blankets. Aang is lying on the root of a tree. Momo screeches and lands on the plateau as Sokka approaches. \n",
      "AANG: [Enthusiastically.] Great, you're back! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang leaps off the root with his airbending, landing beside the Water Tribe siblings as Sokka digs in his bag. \n",
      "AANG: What's for dinner? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Digs nuts from his bag.] We've got a few options. First; round nuts. And some kind of oval shaped nuts? And some rock-shaped nuts, that might just be rocks. [Throws the rock-shaped nut toward Momo.] Dig in! [Aang and Katara look at each other then back at Sokka.] \n",
      "KATARA: Seriously ... what else you got? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo coos, and sniffs the rock-shaped nut, before taking it with one of his paws and slapping it against a stone twice. Attempting to break it, he takes it with both paws and slams it down on the big rock. The moment he does so, however, the entire earth quakes, making Momo shriek and his hair stand up on end. \n",
      "SOKKA: What was that? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo, believing he may have caused the quake, cautiously drops the rock to the ground in test. The quake returns, causing Momo to leap away. \n",
      "AANG: It's coming from over there! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Aang and Katara run off-camera.] Shouldn't we run away from huge booms? Not toward them? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The three, joined by Momo, hide behind a fallen tree and spy on a young boy bending boulders into the air and punching them into the side of the ravine. \n",
      "KATARA: An earthbender! \n",
      "AANG: Let's go meet him! \n",
      "SOKKA: He looks dangerous, so we better approach cautiously. \n",
      "KATARA: [Suddenly Katara is a few feet in front of them, excitedly addressing the earthbender.] Hello there! I'm Katara! What's your name? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The young boy gasps in surprise, dropping the boulder he was bending to the ground. He flees quickly, bringing down an avalanche of boulders with his bending to block his exit. \n",
      "AANG: [Sokka and Aang approach Katara; yelling.] Nice to meet you! \n",
      "KATARA: [Shrugging.] I just wanted to say hi. \n",
      "AANG: Hey! That guy's gotta be running somewhere. Maybe we're near a village? And I bet that village has a market! \n",
      "KATARA: [Excitedly.] Which means no nuts for dinner! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Katara and Aang chase after Haru.] Hey! I worked hard to get those nuts! [Momo flies overhead, chasing Katara and Aang.] Yeah, I hate 'em too. [Slowly follows Katara and Aang.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara and Sokka stroll through the mining village's streets while Aang speaks with a shopkeeper under a terrace. \n",
      "AANG: Great hat! [Tries on the hat.] I'll trade you some nuts for it. \n",
      "KATARA: [Notices the boy enter a shop. Speaks to herself in surprise.] Hey ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The boy enters into the dark, wooden building and approaches a woman. \n",
      "HARU: Hi, Mom. \n",
      "HARU'S.MOTHER: Where have you been, Haru? You're late! Get started on your chores. \n",
      "KATARA: [Enters the shop's front door, startling Haru.] Hey. You're that kid. Why did you run away before? \n",
      "HARU: Uh, you must have me confused with some other kid. \n",
      "AANG: [Aang and Sokka enter the shop.] No, she doesn't. We saw you earthbending. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Haru and his mother gasps in horror at his secret being revealed and both the door and window to the small shop are promptly slammed shut. \n",
      "HARU'S.MOTHER: [Standing by the window.] They saw you doing what?! \n",
      "HARU: They're crazy, Mom! I mean, look at how they're dressed. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang gazes to his conical hat, shifting it about in confusion. Katara awkwardly grasps at her dress, looking with astonishment at herself. Sokka quirks an eyebrow and smooths out his sleeve. \n",
      "HARU'S.MOTHER: You know how dangerous that is! You know what would happen if they caught you earthbending! \n",
      "TAX.COLLECTOR: [Heavy knocks on the door.] Open up! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sokka peeks through the window's blinds.] Fire Nation! Act natural! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Haru's mother opens the door, allowing the Fire Nation tax collector to walk inside. He stares awkwardly at the four children in front of him. Haru grasps his chin and stares toward Katara, cross-eyed. Sokka eyeballs an apple. Katara hunches forward with her eyes wide open, having stuffed her mouth with berries. Aang has his hand atop a barrel, beaming an immense toothy smile. His pose is short-lived as the barrel's lid spins, dunking Aang's hand into the barrel of water and causes him to fall down. \n",
      "HARU'S.MOTHER: [The tax collector stares sourly toward the four children; aggressively.] What do you want? I've already paid you this week! \n",
      "TAX.COLLECTOR: The tax just doubled. [Arrogantly.] And we wouldn't want an accident now would we? [Creates a ball of fire between his hands, making everyone slightly back away.] Fire is sometimes so hard to control. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Haru's mother and the tax collector approach the store's counter, where she opens a small chest and passes a meager handful of Earth Kingdom currency to the tax collector. Haru leans against the counter, staring with contempt toward the Fire Nation man. \n",
      "TAX.COLLECTOR: You can keep the copper ones. [Walks away, dropping four copper pieces to the floor, exits.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Door slams.] Nice guy. How long has the Fire Nation been here? \n",
      "HARU'S.MOTHER: Five years. Fire Lord Ozai uses our town's coal mines to fuel his ships. \n",
      "HARU: They're thugs. They steal from us. And everyone here's too much of a coward to do anything about it. \n",
      "HARU'S.MOTHER: [Angered.] Quiet, Haru! Don't talk like that. \n",
      "KATARA: [Curiously.] But, Haru's an earthbender? He can help! \n",
      "HARU'S.MOTHER: Earthbending is forbidden. It's caused nothing but misery for this village! [Casts a meaningful glance toward her son.] He must never use his abilities. \n",
      "KATARA: How can you say that? Haru has a gift! Asking him not to earthbend is like asking me not to waterbend. It's a part of who we are. \n",
      "HARU'S.MOTHER: [Shakes head in dismay.] You don't understand. \n",
      "KATARA: I understand that Haru can help you fight back. What can the Fire Nation do to you that they haven't done already? \n",
      "HARU'S.MOTHER: They could take Haru away! Like they took his father. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to late evening, viewing farmland and a barn. Appa walks into the barn. Cut to a closer view of Sokka, Katara, Haru, and Aang standing inside the barn. \n",
      "HARU: My mom said you can sleep here tonight. But you should leave in the morning. \n",
      "AANG: Thanks. I'll make sure Appa doesn't eat all your hay. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa engulfs a mouthful of hay. Appa pauses, turning to stare dubiously toward Aang before continuing to chew hay. The scene switches to Katara and Haru taking a walk into the woods outside under the setting sun. \n",
      "KATARA: I'm sorry about what I said earlier. I didn't know about your father. \n",
      "HARU: That's okay. It's funny, the way you were talking back in the store? It reminded me of him. \n",
      "KATARA: [Flattered.] Thanks. \n",
      "HARU: My father was very courageous. When the Fire Nation invaded, he and the other earthbenders were outnumbered ten to one. But they fought back anyway. \n",
      "KATARA: He sounds like a great man. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two approach the top of a steep cliff, gazing out to the setting sun beyond. \n",
      "HARU: [Stops.] After the attack, they rounded up my father and every other earthbender, and took them away. [Kneels.] We haven't seen them since. \n",
      "KATARA: So that's why you hide your earthbending. \n",
      "HARU: Yeah. Problem is ... [Close-up, earthbends two stones in a circle above his hand.] the only way I can feel close to my father now [Crushes the stones to sand with his hands. The sand blows away.] is when I practice my bending. He taught me everything I know. \n",
      "KATARA: [Sits beside Haru, sets her fingertips on her necklace.] See this necklace? My mother gave it to me. \n",
      "HARU: It's beautiful. \n",
      "KATARA: I lost my mother in a Fire Nation raid. [Hangs her head, turning away.] This necklace is all I have left of her. \n",
      "HARU: It's not enough, is it? \n",
      "KATARA: No. [Hangs her head and turns away.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene switches to Katara and Haru who have continued their walk along the dirt trail. A loud boom sounds and rock and dust blasts from a distant mine entrance. An old man cries out. \n",
      "OLD.MAN: Help, help! \n",
      "HARU: The mine! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara and Haru run quickly to the entrance, which has caved in and left a tremendous pile of rocks pinning the old man to the ground on his stomach. Sand continues to pour down, rocks intermittently falling. \n",
      "OLD.MAN: Help me! \n",
      "KATARA: [Haru braces his back against the mine entrance. Katara pulls the old man.] Ugh! It's not working! We have to get help! \n",
      "HARU: There's no time, pull harder! \n",
      "KATARA: [Getting an idea.] Haru. There's a way you can help him. \n",
      "HARU: [Guilty fear.] I can't. \n",
      "KATARA: Please, there's no one around to see you. It's the only way! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Haru leaps away from the falling debris, spinning back to face it as he assumes an earthbending form. With a sudden and strong move, he blasts all the rocks down the tunnel, freeing the old man. \n",
      "KATARA: [Excitedly.] Haru! You did it! [The two take place beside the old man and aid him walking away from the mine.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: At the barn, Katara is sitting up in her bedroll with a lamp in her lap. Sokka is lying on a square bale of hay with his blanket over him, and Aang is sprawled out on Appa's head with Momo lying on his back. \n",
      "KATARA: It was so brave of Haru to use his earthbending to help that old man. \n",
      "AANG: You must have really inspired him. \n",
      "KATARA: I guess so. \n",
      "SOKKA: Everyone should get some sleep, we're leaving at dawn. \n",
      "KATARA: [Unhappily.] Dawn?! Can't we sleep in for once? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Commandingly.] Absolutely not! This village is crawling with Fire Nation troops. If they discover you're here, Aang, we'll be eating fireballs for breakfast. Goodnight. \n",
      "KATARA: [Slyly, with a wry smirk.] I'd rather eat fireballs than nuts. \n",
      "SOKKA: [With finality.] Goodnight! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara and Aang share a few playful chuckles with each other before she blows out the lamplight to get some rest.\n",
      "Fire Nation troops march on a mission through the dead of night. The man in the lead raps on a wooden door. Haru answers the door, suddenly gasping in shock as he sees the troops. \n",
      "OLD.MAN: [Points accusingly.] That's him! That's the earthbender! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Fire Nation leader shoves the old man out of the way and approaches Haru. Haru screams as the man forces Haru into his grip and hauls him away.\n",
      "In the morning, Katara carries a jar outside of the barn. She sets it down beside a water pump and proceeds to waterbend, drawing water out of the spigot and into the waiting pot. Picking it up, she spots Haru's mother standing with her back to her, gazing toward the distant ocean. Haru's mother slowly turns around, laying a tearful gaze upon Katara. Katara realizes Haru has been taken and drops the pot, as it shatters to pieces at her feet. \n",
      "KATARA: [Enters barn to see Aang and Sokka folding blankets; emotionally.] They took him! They took Haru away! \n",
      "AANG: [Surprised.] What? \n",
      "KATARA: [Hurriedly.] The old man turned him in to the Fire Nation - it's all my fault - I forced him into earthbending! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Steps beside her, taking her hand in his and laying his other hand supportively behind her shoulder.] Slow down, Katara. When did this happen? \n",
      "KATARA: Haru's mother said they came for him at midnight. \n",
      "SOKKA: Then it's too late to track him, he's long gone. \n",
      "KATARA: [Turns defiantly to the open door, clenches fists.] We don't need to track him. The Fire Nation is going to take me right to Haru. \n",
      "AANG: [Confused.] And ... why would they do that? \n",
      "KATARA: [Determined.] Because they're going to arrest me for earthbending. [Aang and Sokka share a horrified look.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to Sokka and Katara working together to push a boulder overtop an air vent on a rocky road. \n",
      "SOKKA: I thought you were crazy at first, Katara, but this might work. There are ventilation shafts throughout these mines. All Aang has to do is send an air current from that vent to this one right here. The boulder levitates and ta-da! Fake earthbending. \n",
      "KATARA: [Props hands off hips, turns to Aang.] Aang? Did you get all that? \n",
      "AANG: [Snapping small puffs of air at a sooty copper fritillary butterfly; dismissively.] Sure, sure. I got it. \n",
      "SOKKA: Do you remember your cue? \n",
      "AANG: [Continues snapping puffs of air; still dismissive.] Yeah, yeah. Just relax. You're taking all the fun out of this. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Aggravated.] By this, do you mean intentionally being captured by a group of ruthless firebenders? \n",
      "AANG: [Humored.] Exactly! That's fun stuff! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Group of firebenders with spears approach.] Here they come! Get in your places! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang stops playing with the butterfly and Momo tries catching it as it flies away. As the group of spear-wielding guards approach, Katara and Sokka make a show of walking into one another by their stomachs before emphatically shouting. \n",
      "SOKKA: [While angrily pointing at Katara.] Get out of my way, pipsqueak! [The soldiers watch in confusion. One of them even raises an eyebrow.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Angrily hunched over.] How dare you call me pipsqueak, you giant-eared cretin! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Just as angrily hunched over.] What did you call me? \n",
      "KATARA: [Far too dramatically as her hair loopies move with her motion.] A giant-eared cretin! Look at those things! Do herds of animals use them for shade?! [Imitates an elephant's ears.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Towers over his sister.] You better back off! [Slips his hand by his mouth and mutters.] Seriously, back off. \n",
      "KATARA: [More determined, heightens above her now-cowering brother.] I will not back off! I bet elephants get together and make fun of how large your ears are! \n",
      "SOKKA: That's it! You're going down! \n",
      "KATARA: I'll show you who's boss! [Angrily points at Sokka.] Earthbending style! [Over-dramatically leaps toward the boulder, clenching her fist upward to which there is no reaction. Angrily.] I said, earthbending style! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: At Katara's shout, Aang gasps quietly as he realizes his mistake by missing his cue. The young airbender ceases playing with the butterfly, leaps up, and blasts a strong jet of air into the ventilation duct, suddenly sending the boulder levitating into the air. This reveals Momo behind the boulder, who has his arms raised, licking himself. \n",
      "GUARD: [Points a finger to the lemur; surprised.] That lemur! He's earthbending! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Katara and Momo each remain in their positions. Katara eyes the man in surprise. Sokka, angrily, waves his arms toward her.] No, you idiot, it's the girl! \n",
      "GUARD: Oh. [Blushes shamefully.] Of course. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka steps beside Katara, laying his hands on her shoulders as the boulder falls to the ground. Katara stands patiently. \n",
      "SOKKA: I'll hold her. [Close-up. Whispers to Katara.] You've got twelve hours to find Haru. We'll be right behind you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The guards escort Katara away, leaving Aang, Sokka, and Momo to watch as she takes a final glance back. Sokka unhappily tugs at his ears, testing their sizes. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Eyeballs Momo perched off of Aang's shoulder. Points accusingly.] Momo, you have some big ears! [Momo folds his ears back, hunches down, and coos in protest.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara is in the back of a Fire Nation transport with other earthbender prisoners. She wears a brown, tattered prison garb over her blue Water Tribe outfit and stares glumly downward. Sokka and Aang each have conical yellow hats in a crowd, attempting to stealthily observe her travel. Katara looks longingly over shoulder as the cart bobs along a pier, heading toward a waiting barge on the ocean.\n",
      "Aang and Sokka chase the barge, riding Appa through the clouds. The immense, smoking, off-shore Fire Nation prison rig is seen just ahead. Close-up of the rig. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Aang stares nervously at the barge carrying Katara to the prison.] She'll be fine, Aang. Katara knows what she's doing. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: After the barge arrives, six prisoners, including Katara, line up on the deck of the prison. Spear-wielding guards stand at either side. A prison warden approaches. \n",
      "WARDEN: [Smugly.] Earthbenders. It is my pleasure to welcome you aboard my modest shipyard. I am your warden. I prefer to think of you not as prisoners, [Quips smartly.] but as honored guests. And I hope you come to think of me as your humble and caring host. [Paces nonchalantly.] You will succeed here, if you simply abide- \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The warden pauses, suddenly interrupted by a prisoner in line coughing. With no forewarning, the warden leaps into the air and aims a blast of fire at the prisoner's legs in anger. The prisoner cowers away for safety as the warden stands defiantly toward the man. \n",
      "WARDEN: [Very angrily.] What kind of guest dishonors his host by interrupting him?! Take him below! [Swings his arms. Some guards escort the man away. Mutters.] One week in solitary will improve his manners. [Continues smug gait.] Simply treat me with the courtesy that I give you- \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Approaches Katara, kneeling to stare into her obstinate expression. She crosses her eyebrows, scowling coarsely at the man. \n",
      "WARDEN: And we'll get along famously. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The prisoners are taken on a tour of the facility. Below, fellow prisoners are seen laboring. \n",
      "WARDEN: You will notice, earthbenders, that this rig is made entirely of metal. You are miles away from any rock or earth. [Katara pauses, glancing over the expansive ocean to the land far away.] So, if you have any illusions about employing that brutish savagery that passes for bending among you people ... [Lowly.] forget them. It is impossible. Good day. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A guard escorts the prisoners into the prison courtyard. Katara enters last and the metal gates close behind her. Among many earthbender prisoners, Haru takes notice of Katara. Above the courtyard, a watchman and the warden monitor the scene. \n",
      "HARU: [Surprised.] Katara? \n",
      "KATARA: [Excitedly. Runs and hugs Haru.] Haru! \n",
      "HARU: [Confused.] What are you doing here? \n",
      "KATARA: [Somewhat apologetically.] It's my fault you were captured. I came to rescue you. \n",
      "HARU: [Shocked.] So, you got yourself arrested? \n",
      "KATARA: It was the only way to find you. \n",
      "HARU: You've got guts, Katara. I'll give you that. [Places hand on her shoulder.] Come on. There's someone I want you to meet. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two approach an old, gray-bearded man eating dinner among other prisoners. \n",
      "HARU: Katara. This is my father, Tyro. [The older man looks up.] Dad. This is Katara. \n",
      "KATARA: [Slightly bows.] It's an honor to meet you. \n",
      "TYRO: [Hands Katara a bowl.] Have some dinner, Katara. [Katara accepts the bowl, but grimaces.] It's not as bad as it looks. [Katara tries a spoonful, but becomes further disgusted. He finds humor in this with a small chuckle.] It's still pretty bad though. \n",
      "PRISONER: [Walks up and lays a hand on Tyro's shoulder.] Tyro. The prisoners are complaining there aren't enough blankets to go around. \n",
      "TYRO: I'll talk to the guards. In the meantime, make sure the elderly are taken care of. The rest of us will simply have to hope for warmer weather. \n",
      "KATARA: If you don't mind me asking, what's your escape plan? \n",
      "TYRO: Excuse me? \n",
      "KATARA: You know, the plan to get everyone off the rig? What is it? Mutiny, sabotage? \n",
      "TYRO: The plan? The plan is to survive. Wait out this war. Hope that one day some of us can get back home and forget this ever happened. \n",
      "KATARA: [Shocked.] How can you say that? You sound like you've already given up! \n",
      "TYRO: Katara, I admire your courage. And I envy your youth. But people's lives are at stake here. The warden is a ruthless man, and he won't stand for any rebellion. I'm sorry, but we're powerless. \n",
      "KATARA: [Obstinately.] We'll see about that. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara stands up and carries a trash can lid and a ladle, climbing on top of a wooden table. From there, she bangs the ladle against the lid to draw attention. \n",
      "KATARA: Earthbenders! You don't know me, but I know of you. Every child in my Water Tribe village was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave Earth Kingdom, and the courageous earthbenders who guard its borders. [The watchman walks up to talk the warden, but the warden stops him and listens.] Some of you may think that the Fire Nation has made you powerless. Yes, they have taken away your ability to bend. But they can't take away your courage. And it is your courage they should truly fear! Because it runs deeper than any mine you've been forced to dig, any ocean that keeps you far from home! It is the strength of your hearts that make you who you are. Hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has eroded away. The time to fight back is now! I can tell you the Avatar has returned! So remember your courage earthbenders, [Shouts clearly.] let us fight for our freedom! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara's speech is met with utter silence and a small cough in the background, leaving her to fall into sorrow as she realizes the muted answer she receives. The warden walks away from the courtyard. Later that night while she is sleeping, Aang sneaks into the prison and taps his hand to her shoulder, waking her. Urging her to be quiet, he leads her to the perimeter where Sokka and Appa are waiting to make their escape. \n",
      "SOKKA: Your twelve hours are up; where's Haru? We've gotta get outta here! \n",
      "KATARA: I can't. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Hurriedly.] We don't have much time. There are guards everywhere. Get on! \n",
      "AANG: [Concerned.] Katara, what's wrong? \n",
      "KATARA: I'm not leaving. [Aang and Sokka share a questionable look.] I'm not giving up on these people. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to black. Cut to Sokka, Aang, and Katara on the metal perimeter. \n",
      "SOKKA: What do you mean you're not leaving? \n",
      "KATARA: We can't abandon these people! There has to be a way to help them. \n",
      "AANG: Maybe she's right. What do you say, Sokka? \n",
      "SOKKA: I say you're both crazy! [The trio ducks a searching spotlight.] Last chance! We need to leave, now! \n",
      "KATARA: [Sternly.] No! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Shakes his head dismally.] I hate when you get like this. Come on, we better hide. \n",
      "AANG: [Katara and Sokka flee. Aang whispers to Appa before joining them.] Go hide. \n",
      "CAPTAIN: [Appa soars overhead to fly away and hide.] Look! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two guards who witnessed Appa take to the skies approach the warden on a catwalk. \n",
      "WARDEN: Tell me exactly what you saw. \n",
      "CAPTAIN: Well, sir, it looked like a flying bison. \n",
      "WARDEN: [Surprised.] What? \n",
      "GUARD: It was a giant flying buffalo, sir. With an empty saddle. \n",
      "WARDEN: Which was it? A buffalo or a bison? \n",
      "CAPTAIN: Uh, I'm not sure what the difference is, but that's not really the point, is it, sir? \n",
      "WARDEN: [Furiously.] I'll decide what the point is, fool! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The warden throws the first guard overboard. The man screams in horror before finally being silenced by a splash below. \n",
      "WARDEN: [To the second guard as he straightens up.] You! Wake up the captain. Search the entire rig! [Turns to walk away.] \n",
      "GUARD: Uh, sir. \n",
      "WARDEN: [Annoyed.] What? \n",
      "GUARD: [Somewhat timidly.] That was ... the captain you just threw overboard, so ... \n",
      "WARDEN: [Still quite annoyed.] Then wake up someone I haven't thrown overboard and search the rig! There's something going on here and I don't like it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut scene; Momo peeps over a wooden crate where the trio is safely hiding behind numerous boxes. Scene opens up to show the three huddled together seated on the metal ground in the darkness. \n",
      "SOKKA: We don't have much time. What are we gonna do? \n",
      "AANG: I wish I knew how to make a hurricane! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Both Sokka and Katara provide Aang with assuredly un-entertained facial expressions. \n",
      "AANG: The warden would run away and we'd steal his keys! \n",
      "SOKKA: Wouldn't he just take his keys with him? \n",
      "AANG: I'm just tossing ideas around. \n",
      "KATARA: I tried talking the earthbenders into fighting back but, it didn't work! If there was just a way to help them help themselves. \n",
      "SOKKA: For that they'd need some kind of earth, or some rock. Something they can bend. \n",
      "KATARA: [Lays her palm to the surface.] But this entire place is made of metal! \n",
      "AANG: No, it's not. [Points to smokestacks.] Look at the smoke! I bet they're burning coal. In other words, earth. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Morning arrives, the scene gaining light. Sokka and Katara are alone by an air duct. Sokka is peering down into it, while Katara kneels beside it with her hands on its rim. \n",
      "KATARA: It's almost dawn. We're running out of time! You sure this is gonna work? \n",
      "SOKKA: It should. These vents reminded me of our little trick back at the village. We're gonna do the same thing, but on a much bigger scale. [The camera zooms through a visual walkthrough of Sokka's explanation.] There's a huge deposit of coal at the base of the silo. And the whole system is ventilated. Aang closed off all the vents except one. When he does his airbending the coal only has one place to go, right back here. \n",
      "GUARD: There's the intruder! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two siblings are suddenly surrounded by a number of spear-wielding Fire Nation guards. The prisoners have gathered a safe distance away from this spectacle, observing what is happening. \n",
      "SOKKA: Stay back! I'm warning you! [Pulls out his boomerang, turning back-to-back with his sister.] \n",
      "TYRO: [Roughly.] Katara, stop! You can't win this fight! \n",
      "WARDEN: Listen to him well, child. You're one mistake away from dying where you stand. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A sudden rush of air fills their ears as the facility shakes. The ventilation shaft bursts off its hinges as an immense blast of coal soars into the air, crashing down into a gathered pile. Everyone present is silent, staring in stark surprise at this turn of events. Lastly, Aang leaps out from the barren ventilation shaft, landing atop the coal pile and coughing, covered in soot and dirt. Momo follows him and Katara runs up to the coal, turning to face the earthbenders. \n",
      "KATARA: [Lifting up a piece of coal.] Here's your chance, earthbenders! Take it! Your fate is in your own hands! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Haru bolts ahead without hesitation, prepared to bend the waiting coal as a weapon. Tyro throws his hand up, bracing his son's chest to halt his advance. \n",
      "WARDEN: [Bursts out into highly amused laughter.] Foolish girl. You thought a few inspirational words and some coal would change these people? Look at these blank, hopeless faces. Their spirits were broken a long time ago. [Katara's expression dims as she does as instructed, staring at the forlorn prisoners.] Oh, but you still believe in them. How sweet. They're a waste of your energy little girl. You failed. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The warden finishes his speech by turning to take leave of the facility. As he does so, a single piece of coal sails through the air and pelts the back of his head. Outraged, the warden spins back to see who dared to attack him. Haru stands defiantly levitating three pieces of coal above his hand. The warden sends a blast of fire toward Haru, but the fire is blocked, as Tyro raises a wall of coal in his defense. \n",
      "WARDEN: [Guards line up and prepare for battle.] Show no mercy! [The guards send a blast of fire as one toward the rebelling prisoners.] \n",
      "TYRO: [The earthbenders work together to haul a sizable mass of coal to block the fire.] For the Earth Kingdom, attack! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Slamming the coal to the ground; chunks of rock assault the guards. The battle immediately flares, prisoners ducking blasts of fire and countering with fists of coal. Katara and Aang chase after Sokka as he snaps soldiers spears in two with his boomerang, tossing the broken shafts to Momo overhead. Momo continues to collect other pieces of broken spears that are thrown up to him.\n",
      "Tyro and Haru work in unison to compress gathered coal into one lump, slinging this through the doors to make way for their escape. The guards on top fall down. \n",
      "TYRO: Get to the ships! We'll hold them off! \n",
      "WARDEN: Do not let them escape! \n",
      "AANG: [Generates an air funnel and holds it between his hands; to Katara and Sokka.] Guys! Throw me some coal! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara and Sokka drop heaps of coal into his funnel, firing the material rapidly at the warden and his fellow benders, knocking them to the ground. Following this, Tyro and two other earthbenders work together to lift coal beneath these adversaries, moving them away from the rig and over the ocean. \n",
      "WARDEN: [Pleading.] No, please! I can't swim! \n",
      "TYRO: Don't worry. I hear cowards float. [Drops their enemies into the ocean.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: On the barge headed to their homes, Haru and Tyro approach Katara on its deck. \n",
      "HARU: I want to thank you for saving me. For saving us. \n",
      "KATARA: [Turning to face Haru. Denying.] All it took was a little coal. \n",
      "HARU: It wasn't the coal, Katara. It was you. [Katara blushes.] \n",
      "TYRO: Thank you for helping me find my courage, Katara of the Water Tribe. My family and everyone here owes you much. \n",
      "KATARA: So, I guess you're going home now. \n",
      "TYRO: Yes. To take back my village. [Raises his voice to the crowd on the lower deck.] To take back all of our villages! The Fire Nation will regret the day they set foot on our land! [Crowd cheers at Tyro's bravado.] \n",
      "HARU: [To Katara.] Come with us. \n",
      "KATARA: I can't. Your mission is to take back your home. Ours is to get Aang to the North Pole. [Gazes over the rail to see Momo join Aang atop Appa's head, floating in the ocean.] \n",
      "HARU: That's him, isn't it? The Avatar. [Aang airbends an encased piece of coal. Momo jumps into his lap.] Katara, thank you for bringing my father back to me. I never thought I'd see him again. I only wish there was some way ... \n",
      "KATARA: I know. [Reaches for her necklace wistfully, but realizes it is not around her neck and panics.] My mother's necklace! It's gone! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back on the prison rig, Zuko stands alone facing the sunset amid coal lying sparsely on the deck. He seizes Katara's necklace in his fingers, lifting it to stare at it grimly. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens to a cloudy sky, looking toward the ground. The point of view switches to one above the clouds as they pass by. A messenger hawk floats into view, emitting a cry. When Appa overshadows the bear and roars, it shrieks again and stoops down, swiveling out of view. The camera shifts to a side-view of Appa soaring along with Aang, Katara and Sokka in his saddle. \n",
      "KATARA: [Voice-over; somewhat dreamily.] Those clouds look so soft, [Cut to Aang sitting lazily atop Appa's head, a twig in his mouth; the view pans to the left, showing Sokka carving something with an uninterested look on his face, Katara lying on her stomach, popped up on her elbows, staring dreamingly over the rim of Appa's saddle, and Momo sleeping on the luggage.] don't they? Like you could just jump down and you'd land in a big, soft, cottony heap? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Turns to Katara; mockingly with a smile.] Maybe you should give it a try. \n",
      "KATARA: [Looks at Sokka with annoyance; sarcastically as she looks away from him.] You're hilarious. \n",
      "AANG: [Frontal shot; excitedly.] I'll try it! [Carrying his staff, he jumps off Appa with a big smile on his face. As he begins to fall, he turns once around his axis, winking at the camera as he passes. He falls down spreadeagled, laughing joyously.] Yeah! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a side-view of Appa's saddle as Katara and Sokka pop their heads over the rim, looking down in the direction Aang went. Cut to an upward looking shot following Aang falling down, still smiling broadly. As he passes the camera, it tilts down, following him as he vanishes in a cloud. Cut back to the siblings; Katara looks somewhat worried, while Sokka gazes wide-eyed at the point where Aang vanished. When he leans over to search the sky, Aang comes back up from behind them on his glider. The siblings turn around as they hear the snapping noise of Aang's glider being closed, and they watch how the airbender plops down on the saddle, his legs spread apart and a big smile on his face. Cut to a side-view of an unimpressed looking Sokka, before switching back to a frontal shot of Aang who is dripping wet. \n",
      "AANG: [Looking at himself.] Turns out, clouds are made of water. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He breaths in deeply and slams his balled, right fist against his stretched left hand, creating an expanding air ball around him in the process, drying himself off. As Aang leans back to rest on both his hands, he contently looks at Momo, whose fur got all fluffed by Aang's airbending. Cut to a side-view of Sokka, who is still looking at Aang unimpressed. Katara glances at her brother, but her attention is drawn to something over his shoulder. \n",
      "KATARA: Hey, what is that? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka looks over his right shoulder in the direction Katara is looking as well. Katara gets up and walks to the front of Appa's saddle. Cut to a shot of the landscape in front of them, a large, dark patch of burned land standing out among the lush green of the forest. Cut to a frontal view of the trio now all looking over the front rim of Appa's saddle, surprised looks on their faces. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Camera zooms in.] It's like a scar ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene fades to a ground view of the scorched forest. The camera pans to the right, showing many burned trees, and Team Avatar standing in the middle of a gray, barren patch. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Voice-over.] Listen. [Cut to a frontal shot of a sad-looking Aang, his friends behind him.] It's so quiet. There's no life anywhere. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang? Are you okay? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Noticing footprints; angrily.] Fire Nation! Those evil savages make me sick! They have no respect for - \n",
      "KATARA: Shhh! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Whispering angrily.] What? I'm not allowed to be angry? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara points to Aang with a somewhat concerned look on her face as he slumps over, downcast at the sight. \n",
      "AANG: [Kneels down and sighs. He picks up some ash as it slowly seeps through his hand and drops to the ground; sadly.] Why would anyone do this? How could I let this happen? \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, you didn't let this happen. It has nothing to do with you. \n",
      "AANG: [Sadly.] Yes, it does. It's the Avatar's job to protect nature. But I don't know how to do my job. \n",
      "KATARA: That's why we're going to the North Pole. [Smiling softly.] To find you a teacher. \n",
      "AANG: Yeah. A waterbending teacher. But there's no one who can teach me how to be the Avatar. Monk Gyatso said that Avatar Roku would help me. \n",
      "SOKKA: The Avatar before you? He died over a hundred years ago; how are you supposed to talk to him? \n",
      "AANG: I don't know. [Momo comes up to Aang and settles in his lap.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: In another area, Zuko comes looking for Iroh. \n",
      "ZUKO: Uncle! It's time to leave! Where are you? Uncle Iroh! \n",
      "IROH: [Relaxing in a hot spring.] Over here! \n",
      "ZUKO: Uncle? We need to move on. We're closing in on the Avatar's trail and I don't want to lose him. \n",
      "IROH: You look tired, Prince Zuko. Why don't you join me in these hot springs and soak away your troubles? \n",
      "ZUKO: My troubles cannot be soaked away. It's time to go! \n",
      "IROH: You should take your teacher's advice and relax a little. The temperature's just right. I heated it myself. [He breathes steam through his nose.] \n",
      "ZUKO: Enough! We need to leave now. Get out of the water! \n",
      "IROH: Very well! [He gets up, exposing himself.] \n",
      "ZUKO: [Shielding his eyes.] On second thought, why don't you take another few minutes? But be back at the ship in a half-hour or I'm leaving without you! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Iroh sighs as he slumps back into the water.\n",
      "The scene returns to the forest. \n",
      "KATARA: [Approaches Aang.] Hey, Aang! You ready to be cheered up? \n",
      "AANG: [Sadly.] No. [An acorn is thrown at him.] Ow! Hey, how is that cheering me up? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Chuckles.] Cheered me up. [An acorn gets thrown at him.] Ow. Yeah, I probably deserved that. \n",
      "KATARA: These acorns are everywhere, Aang. That means the forest will grow back! Every one of these will be a tall oak tree someday, and all the birds and animals that lived here will come back. [She places the acorn in his hand and closes it.] \n",
      "AANG: Thanks, Katara. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara smiles at him before gasping at the sight of an old man approaching. \n",
      "SOKKA: Hey, who are you? \n",
      "OLD.WANDERER: When I saw the flying bison, I thought it was impossible! [Approaches Aang.] But, those markings ... are you the Avatar, child? [Aang look to Katara, who nods. He nods himself.] My village desperately needs your help! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to them at Senlin Village at sunset. The village has been partially destroyed. The wanderer leads them into the center building. \n",
      "OLD.WANDERER: This young person is the Avatar! \n",
      "SENLIN.VILLAGE.LEADER: So, the rumors of your return are true! It is the greatest honor of a lifetime to be in your presence. \n",
      "AANG: Nice to meet you too! So ... is there something I can help you with? \n",
      "SENLIN.VILLAGE.LEADER: I'm not sure ... \n",
      "OLD.WANDERER: Our village is in crisis, he's our only hope! [To Aang.] For the last few days at sunset, a spirit monster comes and attacks our village. He is Hei Bai, the black and white spirit. \n",
      "SOKKA: Why is it attacking you? \n",
      "SENLIN.VILLAGE.LEADER: We do not know, but each of the last three nights, he has abducted one of our own. We are especially fearful because the winter solstice draws near. \n",
      "KATARA: What happens then? \n",
      "OLD.WANDERER: As the solstice approaches, the natural world and the Spirit World grow closer and closer until the line between them is blurred completely. \n",
      "SENLIN.VILLAGE.LEADER: Hei Bai is already causing devastation and destruction. Once the solstice is here, there's no telling what will happen. \n",
      "AANG: So, what do you want me to do, exactly? \n",
      "OLD.WANDERER: Who better to resolve a crisis between our world and the Spirit World than the Avatar himself? You are the great bridge between man and spirits. \n",
      "AANG: Right ... that's me. \n",
      "KATARA: Hey great bridge guy, could I talk to you over here for a second? [She leads him toward a window.] Aang, you seem a little unsure about all of this. \n",
      "AANG: Yeah, that might be because I don't know anything at all about the Spirit World. It's not like there's someone to teach me this stuff! \n",
      "KATARA: So ... can you help these people? \n",
      "AANG: I have to try, don't I? Maybe whatever I have to do will just ... come to me. [Momo lands on his shoulder.] \n",
      "KATARA: [With a kind and reassuring smile.] I think you can do it, Aang. \n",
      "SOKKA: [With a similar expression.] Yeah. [Brief pause.] We're all going to get eaten by a spirit monster. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut back to the hot spring. A sleeping Iroh is awoken by nearby stirring in the trees. \n",
      "IROH: Who's there? [He sees a rat-like animal.] A meadow vole! I should have known. [He takes the creature into the palm of his hand.] You startled me, little one. [Sighs.] It seems I dozed off and missed my nephew's deadline, but it was a very sweet nap. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The meadow vole leaps up and down. This is followed by shaking and the ground moving toward Iroh. Suddenly, the rock at the bottom of the spring jumps up, capturing him. Three Earth Kingdom soldiers surround him. \n",
      "SOLDIER: [Picks up Iroh's clothes.] He's a Fire Nation soldier. \n",
      "EARTHBENDER.CAPTAIN: He's no ordinary soldier. This is the Fire Lord's brother, the Dragon of the West. The once-great General Iroh, but now, he's our prisoner. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Iroh gives the captain a stern look.\n",
      "Cut back to Senlin, near sunset. Aang steps outside the center building and awaits the Hei Bai. \n",
      "AANG: [Walking toward the village entrance.] Hello, Spirit? Can you hear me? This is the Avatar speaking. I'm here to try to help stuff. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the building interior. Sokka and Katara watch. \n",
      "SOKKA: This isn't right. We can't sit here and cower while Aang waits for some monster to show up. \n",
      "OLD.WANDERER: If anyone can save us, he can. \n",
      "SOKKA: He still shouldn't have to face this alone. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The sun sets and night falls. Cut back to Aang. \n",
      "AANG: The sun has set. Where are you, Hei Bai? Well ... spirit ... uhhh ... I hereby ask you to please leave this village in peace. [He spins his staff and sticks it down, in apparent authority.] Okay ... well ... I guess that's settled, then. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He walks away. Behind him, however, the Hei Bai fades into the real world. He walks right behind Aang, who turns to see him. \n",
      "AANG: You must be the Hei Bai spirit. My name is– \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The spirit releases a burst of energy at him. It moves past him. \n",
      "AANG: My name's Aang! I'm the Avatar and I would like to help. Hey, wait up! [Hei Bai wreaks havoc, smashing buildings and destroying a tower with energy.] Uhhh. \n",
      "SENLIN.VILLAGE.LEADER: The Avatar's methods are ... unusual. \n",
      "SOKKA: It doesn't seem too interested in what he's saying. Maybe we should go help him. \n",
      "OLD.WANDERER: No. Only the Avatar stands a chance against the Hei Bai. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang will figure out the right thing to do, Sokka. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Hei Bai smashes another building. \n",
      "AANG: Please, would you stop destroying things and listen? I'm trying to do my job as spirit bridge! Excuse me, would please turn around? I command you to turn around now! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The spirit hits Aang and sends him flying to the roof of another building. \n",
      "SOKKA: That's it. He needs help. [Exits the building.] \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka, wait! [Starts to follow him.] \n",
      "SENLIN.VILLAGE.LEADER: [Stops her.] It's not safe! \n",
      "SOKKA: Hei Bai, over here! [He throws his boomerang at him, but it barely affects the monster. He runs toward it.] \n",
      "AANG: Sokka, go back! \n",
      "SOKKA: We'll fight him together, Aang. \n",
      "AANG: I don't want to fight him unless I– [Sokka is taken by the Hei Bai, and the spirit flees. Aang chases it.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Running to the village entrance.] Sokka! [The villagers go the entrance as well. Katara is left standing fearful.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back near the hot spring. Two soldiers and Zuko look for Iroh. \n",
      "ZUKO: Uncle! Uncle, where are you? \n",
      "FIRE.NATION.SOLDIER: Sir, maybe he thought you left without him. \n",
      "ZUKO: Something's not right here. That pile of rocks. \n",
      "FIRE.NATION.SOLDIER: It looks like there's been a landslide, sir. \n",
      "ZUKO: Land doesn't slide uphill. Those rocks didn't move naturally. [Stands up straight.] My Uncle's been captured by earthbenders! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back to the forest. Aang continues to pursue the Hei Bai, looking for Sokka. \n",
      "SOKKA: Aang! Over here! Help! \n",
      "AANG: Hang on, Sokka! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang pulls out his hand, trying to free Sokka. However, before he can grab him, the spirit fades away, taking Sokka with it. Aang falls in front of a bear-like statue, knocked out.\n",
      "A couple of hours later, Aang awakens. \n",
      "AANG: Sokka! [He realizes Sokka is nowhere to be seen.] I failed. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The next scene cuts back to the soldiers who captured Iroh. They are riding ostrich horses. One soldier carries a torch with him for light. \n",
      "IROH: Where are you taking me? \n",
      "EARTHBENDER.CAPTAIN: We're taking you to face justice. \n",
      "IROH: Right, but where, specifically? \n",
      "EARTHBENDER.CAPTAIN: A place you're quite familiar with, actually. You once laid siege to it for 600 days, but it would not yield to you. \n",
      "IROH: Ah, the great city of Ba Sing Se. \n",
      "EARTHBENDER.CAPTAIN: It was greater than you were, apparently. \n",
      "IROH: I acknowledge my defeat at Ba Sing Se. After 600 days away from home, my men were tired, and I was tired. [Yawns.] And I'm still tired. [He falls off one of the horses. He is quickly picked back up. However, he leaves one of his sandals behind and smiles cleverly.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut back to Senlin Village. Katara awaits at the village entrance for Sokka and Aang. The Old wanderer approaches her. \n",
      "OLD.WANDERER: I'm sure they'll be back. \n",
      "KATARA: I know. \n",
      "OLD.WANDERER: [Places a blanket around her.] You should get some rest. \n",
      "KATARA: Everything's going to be okay ... \n",
      "OLD.WANDERER: Your brother is in good hands. I would be shocked if the Avatar returned without him. [As he is speaking, Aang approaches.] \n",
      "AANG: Katara? Katara, I lost him. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The sun rises. \n",
      "OLD.WANDERER: The sun is rising. Perhaps he will return soon. \n",
      "AANG: [His appearance is blue.] What? No, I'm right here! [He waves his hand in the Wanderer's face, only to notice his own appearance.] I'm in the Spirit World! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut back to the forest. Zuko comes up on Iroh's sandal. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Sniffs and gets a disgusted look.] Yeah, that's Uncle Iroh. [He re-mounts his rhino.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back at the Village. \n",
      "AANG: I'll figure this out, Katara. I promise. Like they said, I'm the bridge between the worlds, right? All I have to do is ... figure out what I have to do. But once I do that, no problem. [Appa approaches.] Appa! Hey buddy, I'm right here! [He breathes on Katara.] But, I guess you can't see me either. \n",
      "KATARA: It's okay, Appa, don't worry. I'm sure they're on their way back. I bet they even found you a bunch of moon peaches for a treat. [The two return the village.] \n",
      "AANG: What am I supposed to do? Avatar Roku, how can I talk to you? [He hears something.] Sokka? [He notices a dragon coming toward him.] That's definitely not Sokka. [He tries to fly away but cannot. He notices his airbending is not working at all.] What? I can't airbend in the Spirit World. [The dragon lands just before him.] You don't know where Sokka is, do you? [The dragon touches him. He sees a vision of Roku flying on this dragon.] You're Avatar Roku's animal guide! Like Appa is to me! I need to save my friend and I don't know how! Is there some way for me to talk to Roku? [The dragon curls around him, and he gets on him.] I'll be back, Katara. [It gets up.] Take me to Roku! [The dragon flies away.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a mountain the earthbenders are leading Iroh through. Iroh looks at the skies and notices the dragon and Aang. He gasps in wonder. \n",
      "EARTHBENDER.CAPTAIN: What's the problem? \n",
      "IROH: Nothing. [Pauses.] Actually, there is a bit of a problem. My old joints are sore and aching, and these shackles are too loose. \n",
      "EARTHBENDER.CAPTAIN: Too loose? \n",
      "IROH: That's right. The cuffs move and jangle around and bump my wrists. It would help me if you tighten them so they wouldn't shake around so much. \n",
      "EARTHBENDER.CAPTAIN: Very well. Corporal, tighten the prisoner's handcuffs. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They all stop. The corporal dismounts and moves to Iroh. As he touches his handcuffs, Iroh breathes deeply and heats them up. He pushes the corporal's hand to the cuffs, causing him to scream in pain. Iroh jumps free and blasts fire at the soldiers. He rolls down the hill as the soldiers try to get control of their ostrich horses.\n",
      "Cut back to Aang and Fang. Fang takes him to a temple on an unknown island. He flies into the temple and toward the roof. \n",
      "AANG: Hey, what are you doing? [He screams, but they fly right through the roof and into a mysterious room. Within is a celestial calendar and a statue of Roku.] I don't understand, this is just a statue of Roku. [Fang presses one of his feelers to Aang's forehead. A vision of a comet appears to him.] Is that what Roku wants to talk to me about? A comet? When can I talk to him? [Fang moves his head, allowing a light beam to appear. This is just to the right of Roku's statue. With another feeler press, he sees a vision of the sun setting and rising repeatedly, and the light closing in on Roku.] It's a calendar, and the light will reach Roku on the solstice! So, that's when I'll be able to speak to Roku? [The dragon breathes an apparent yes.] But I can't wait that long! I need to save Sokka now! [The dragon takes Aang from the temple.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut back to Iroh rolling down the hill. One of the soldiers hits him with a rockslide. All of the soldiers chase after him, reaching him at the bottom of the hill. \n",
      "SOLDIER: He's too dangerous, Captain! We just can't just carry him to the Capital! We have to do something now! \n",
      "EARTHBENDER.CAPTAIN: I agree. He must be dealt with immediately and severely. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Iroh spits a rock out.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Katara is flying on Appa over the forest. \n",
      "KATARA: It's no use, Appa. I don't seem them anywhere. Our best hope is to go back to the village and wait. [She re-directs Appa to the village's direction.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: While following the ostrich horse footprints, Zuko notices Appa. \n",
      "ZUKO: The Avatar! [He turns slightly, but looks back at the footprints.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fang takes Aang back to the statue at fast speed. Aang notices his body is there and also prepares for impact. Suddenly, Fang disappears into the statue and Aang is returned to his body. He looks around at the statue, opens his glider, and flies back to the village.\n",
      "Cut to the village, sunset. Katara stands outside the center building and notices Aang's return. Aang lands and Katara runs to him. \n",
      "KATARA: You're back! [She embraces Aang.] Where's Sokka? \n",
      "AANG: I'm not sure ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The evening gives way to night. \n",
      "Back to Iroh, who is surrounded by the soldiers. \n",
      "EARTHBENDER.CAPTAIN: These dangerous hands must be crushed. [He brings up and prepares to drop it. However, Zuko jumps in and kicks the rock away before breaking Iroh's chain with his boot.] \n",
      "IROH: Excellent form, Prince Zuko. \n",
      "ZUKO: You taught me well. \n",
      "EARTHBENDER.CAPTAIN: Surrender yourselves. It's five against two. You're clearly outnumbered. \n",
      "IROH: Yeah, that's true, but you are clearly outmatched. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The solders fire rocks, but Iroh destroys them with the chains. Zuko takes out two soldiers with fire. A rock is fired at him, but Iroh catches it and throws it back at the soldiers, knocking them down. The Captain fires three rocks at Zuko, which he dodges. Zuko counters with fire blasts that are dodged. The captain brings up a large mass of rock, however, Iroh throws his chains around his ankles, knocking him and causing the rocks to fall on top of him. The soldiers are heard groaning underneath the rocks. \n",
      "ZUKO: Now would you please put on some clothes? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut back to Senlin. Aang awaits at the entrance for the Hei Bai. After some time, he gives up and returns to the center building. Just as he exits, however, the spirit appears to his left. He throws up an air shield to stop its attack. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, what are you doing?! Run! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The spirit prepares to resume its attack when Aang jumps in front of it. He feels its forehead and notices that a panda lurks below it. \n",
      "AANG: You're the spirit of this forest! Now I understand. You're upset and angry because your home was burned down. When I saw the forest had burned, I was sad and upset, but my friend gave me hope that the forest would grow back. [He shows it the acorn and leaves it at his feet. The spirit picks it up and reverts to the panda form. It walks away peacefully. As it exits, a series of branches grow, and three villagers and Sokka emerge from it.] \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka! [She runs to him and embraces him, while other villagers embrace their loved ones.] \n",
      "SOKKA: What happened? \n",
      "KATARA: You were trapped in the Spirit World for 24 hours! How are you feeling? \n",
      "SOKKA: Like I seriously need to use the bathroom. [Katara gives Sokka a somewhat disgusted look.] \n",
      "SENLIN.VILLAGE.LEADER: Thank you, Avatar. If only there were a way to repay you for what you've done. \n",
      "SOKKA: You could give us some supplies, and some money. \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka! \n",
      "SOKKA: What? We need stuff. \n",
      "SENLIN.VILLAGE.LEADER: It would be an honor to help you prepare for your journey. \n",
      "KATARA: I'm so proud of you, Aang. You figured out what to do, all on your own. \n",
      "AANG: Actually, I did have a little help and there's something else. \n",
      "SOKKA: What is it? \n",
      "AANG: I need to talk to Roku and I think I found a way to contact his spirit. \n",
      "KATARA: That's great! \n",
      "SOKKA: Creepy, but great. \n",
      "AANG: There's a temple on a crescent-shaped island and if I go there on the solstice, I'll be able to speak with him. \n",
      "KATARA: But the solstice is tomorrow! \n",
      "AANG: Yeah, and there's one more problem. The island is in the Fire Nation. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The siblings grow fearful. The shot slowly moves up to the moon over the hills. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene opens to a full moon in the sky. The camera pans down and shows Senlin Village during early morning hours. Cut to a view from among the houses, slowly zooming in on Aang who tries to get Appa to move, yanking on the reins, though the bison continually refuses and sits down. \n",
      "AANG: [Strained voice.] Let's go, Appa! Come on, boy! [Appa roars in protest and sits down. Cut to a close side-view; Aang sadly addresses his pet.] Look I'm sorry, but Katara and Sokka aren't coming to the Fire Nation with us. [Frontal shot; looks down and away, sadly.] If they got hurt, I'd never forgive myself. [Cut back to the side-shot; sternly, emphasizing his command by straightening himself.] So get your big butt off the ground and let's go! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He jerks at the reins, stretching them out, but is flung to the ground when the ropes pull him back as Appa did not move a muscle. Cut to a forlorn looking Aang, sitting spread-legged on the ground. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Voice-over; Aang gasps in surprise and looks over his right shoulder and over his left, turning around in search for the origins of the voice.] I think his big butt is trying to tell ya something. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a frontal shot of Appa as the camera swiftly pans to the right to reveal a collection of Senlin villagers, with Katara and Sokka standing in the front. \n",
      "KATARA: [Desperately.] Please don't go Aang. The world can't afford to lose you to the Fire Nation. [Closer shot of Katara's pleading face.] Neither can I. \n",
      "AANG: [Looks away sadly and recalls an image of Sozin's Comet.] But I have to talk to Avatar Roku to find out what my vision means! [Side-shot as he approaches his friends.] I need to get to the Fire Temple before the sun sets on the solstice. That's today! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang airbends himself atop Appa's head. Close shot of him looking back with a sad expression on his face as he prepares to leave. As Appa stands up, the shot changes to a frontal view, and Katara and Sokka run to stand before the bison, preventing him from moving any further. \n",
      "KATARA: We're not letting you go into the Fire Nation, Aang. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Aang stares curiously.] At least, not without your friends. We got your back. [Momo soars up and perches atop Aang's shoulder, and Appa licks Sokka, who angrily looks at the bison.] Ew! \n",
      "SENLIN.VILLAGE.LEADER: It's a long journey to the Crescent Island. [Hands Aang a small bundle.] You'll have to fly fast to have any chance of making it before sundown. Good luck. \n",
      "AANG: Thank you for your- \n",
      "SENLIN.VILLAGE.LEADER: [Interrupts sharply, yelling. Points toward the ocean.] Go! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa takes off with Aang, Momo, Katara, and Sokka. Later that morning, the Senlin Village leader exits a building, but he stops in his track upon finding Zuko standing in his path. In the background, Iroh is sitting on a komodo rhino. \n",
      "ZUKO: [The Senlin Village leader gasps.] Having trouble sleeping? [Pushes the man back through the door, knocking him down. Frontal shot as he approaches him.] Seen the Avatar lately? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Day has come. Appa soars over the ocean. Aang, Katara, and Sokka all watch the ocean fearfully. \n",
      "AANG: Come on boy, we've got a long way to go. Faster! \n",
      "IROH: [Close-up.] Sailing into Fire Nation waters ... Of all the foolish things you've done in your sixteen years, Prince Zuko, this is the most foolish! \n",
      "ZUKO: I have no choice, Uncle. \n",
      "IROH: [Angrily.] Have you completely forgotten that the Fire Lord banished you? [Fearfully.] What if you're caught? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Breaks away from telescope to talk to his uncle.] I'm chasing the Avatar! My father will understand why I am returning home! \n",
      "IROH: You give him too much credit. My brother is not the understanding type! \n",
      "ZUKO: [Looks back into his telescope. Dark scope view reveals Appa mid-flight.] There they are. Helmsman! Full steam ahead! \n",
      "KATARA: [Looking back to Zuko's ship.] Aang. We've got trouble! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Panicked.] Yeah! And it's gaining, fast! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A Fire Nation catapult is raised to the deck of Zuko's ship. It is loaded with a steaming projectile. \n",
      "IROH: [Waving a fan at his face.] Uh, really Prince Zuko, couldn't you shoot them down with something more fragrant? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Lights the stinking ball with a fire punch.] On my mark! Fire! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A guard beside him slices the rope holding back the catapult. The flaming projectile races toward Appa. \n",
      "KATARA: [Yelling.] Fireball! \n",
      "AANG: I'm on it! \n",
      "KATARA: [Aang, Katara, and Sokka all make faces and grasp their noses.] We have to get out of Zuko's range, before he shoots another hot stinker at us! \n",
      "SOKKA: Can't you make Appa go any faster? \n",
      "AANG: Yeah. But there's just one little problem. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Close-up. Eyes widening.] A blockade. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Birds-eye view of a two-row line of Fire Nation ships stretching across the ocean as far as the eye can see. Brief glimpse of numerous Fire Nation catapults prepared to fire. \n",
      "IROH: Technically you are still in Earth Kingdom waters. Turn back now and they cannot arrest you. \n",
      "AANG: If we fly north, we can go around the Fire Nation ships and avoid the blockade! It's the only way. \n",
      "KATARA: There's no time! \n",
      "AANG: This is exactly why I didn't want you to come! It's too dangerous! \n",
      "KATARA: And that's exactly why we're here. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Boldly.] Let's run this blockade! [Both Katara and Sokka grin confidently.] \n",
      "AANG: Appa, yip-yip! [Appa roars readily, sailing forward even quicker.] \n",
      "ZUKO: He's not turning around! \n",
      "IROH: Please Prince Zuko! If the Fire Nation captures you, there is nothing I can do! Do not follow the Avatar. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Lowers his head, closes his eyes, and clenches his hands into fists. Sorrowfully.] I'm sorry, Uncle. [Raises his head, opens his eyes, and thrusts his right hand forward commandingly.] Run the blockade! \n",
      "ZHAO: [Gazing through telescope.] The Avatar. [Lowers telescope lens to spot Zuko's ship.] And the banished prince. [Lowers telescope.] This must be my lucky day. \n",
      "CAPTAIN: Commander Zhao. What are your orders? \n",
      "ZHAO: Shoot the bison down, captain. \n",
      "CAPTAIN: [Surprised.] But there's a Fire Navy ship out there, sir! One of our own! What if it's hit? \n",
      "ZHAO: So be it. [Captain backs up in shock. Zhao continues coolly.] It belongs to a traitor. [Command.] Ignite. Launch! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The sky becomes littered with flaming fireballs fired from the blockade. View from Zuko's ship as the fireballs fill the sky. Close-up of a screaming Aang, Sokka, and Katara. Zoom out as Appa evades numerous fireballs, some exploding mid-air. Camera switch to forward view, close-up, as they fly through a blanket of fireballs. The team flies directly through one that exploded before them, Appa's fur darkened from the explosion. Katara, Sokka, and Momo all slap out embers on Appa's fur. \n",
      "AANG: Appa, are you okay? [Appa roars a reply. They soar higher into the clouds.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: On the ocean surface, Zuko's ship is narrowly missing many falling fireballs. Sheets of ocean water crash over the ship, and crew members run for safety. A single fireball explodes on the aft side of the vessel. \n",
      "ENGINEER: Prince Zuko! The engines are damaged! We need to stop and make repairs! \n",
      "ZUKO: [Spins away from the man, facing the blockade.] Do not stop this ship. \n",
      "ZHAO: Launch! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Close-up of Aang's view. Just over a cloud; fireballs burst through everywhere and smoke fills the screen. Aang, Katara, and Sokka scream and duck away, while Katara and Sokka grip Appa's saddle. Appa dodges many fireballs before two collide and explode in front of him. Sokka is thrown from the saddle and begins to plunge for the ocean, screaming anew. \n",
      "AANG: [Cries out desperately.] Sokka! [Whips the reins down and begins a speedy descent in chase of Sokka.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa reaches Sokka just in time. Katara grabs his hand, pulling him back into saddle. Appa skims the ocean surface. A fish appears out of nowhere and slaps Sokka square in the face, knocking him into the saddle. Momo leaps up and grabs the fish as Appa continues his swift flight mere feet above the ocean. Fireballs crash into the water all around them. \n",
      "ZHAO: Ready ... [Holds hand up, issuing his command.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Close-up of Appa's view, approaching the ships. Camera switch once to Zhao, moving to prepare the signal. Back to Aang, a look of obstinate determination overcomes him. \n",
      "ZHAO: Fire! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A single catapult launches a fire blast directly toward Appa. Close-up of Aang's eye as it snaps open, unafraid. Aang airbends forward off of Appa's head. He uses a powerful airbending kick, and the flaming boulder explodes in a large smoky blast. Aang falls back to Appa's head, Katara and Sokka grabbing him. Appa soars safely over the blockade, passing them. \n",
      "AANG: [Ecstatic.] We made it! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Katara and Sokka each grimacing in terror.] We got into the Fire Nation. [Meekly.] Great. \n",
      "CAPTAIN: Where do you think the Avatar is headed, sir? \n",
      "ZHAO: I'm not sure. [Turns aside, gazes at Zuko's smoking ship.] But I bet a certain banished prince will know. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene switch to just overhead Zuko's ship. His small vessel approaches two ships in the blockade. These two ships sail opposite directions, in a moment they will close off Zuko's ship's path. \n",
      "IROH: We're on a collision course! \n",
      "ZUKO: [Confidently.] We can make it! \n",
      "CAPTAIN: [Captain stands ahead of a squad of nine firebenders.] The boarding party is ready to apprehend Prince Zuko, sir. \n",
      "ZHAO: [Swiftly.] Wait! Cut the engines, and let them pass. \n",
      "CAPTAIN: Sir? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Each ship in the blockade halts, allowing Zuko's ship to glide by beneath their deck, untouched. Zhao stands high, sharing an interlocked gaze with the banished prince below. Zuko and Iroh look behind them in silence as they sail safely through. Iroh strokes his gray beard curiously. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts back to Appa, flying among blue skies. Sokka and Katara sit up in the saddle, while Aang sits on Appa's head.\n",
      "The scene changes to Sokka slumped in the back of the saddle. Katara is leaning her arms over the front of the saddle, and Aang is lounging against Appa's neck.\n",
      "The sky has changed to a darker, sunset-filled evening. Appa is visibly tired. Aang is sprawled over Appa's head with Momo equally sprawled over Aang's head. Katara and Sokka have each collapsed into the saddle. \n",
      "AANG: [Close-up. Momo is shown bouncing about in eager surprise.] There it is! [Sokka and Katara pop up in the saddle.] The island where Roku's dragon took me. [Full view of Crescent Island and its smoking volcano as Appa descends.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa is lying at the base of a stone bridge leading up to the island's mountain. The bridge ends at an elegant, multi-story Fire Temple. Lava is flowing beneath the bridge. The air is thick with steam. Aang stands by Appa's head, and Katara stands to Appa's side. Sokka is stretching further away. \n",
      "AANG: [Rubs against Appa's head.] You did it buddy. Nice flying. [Appa bellows in satisfaction, rolling to his side to wave his three legs into the air lazily. Appa's tongue lolls out.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Smiles sweetly and approaches Appa. Rubs his belly.] Aww, you must be tired. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Joyous. Katara's expresses dumbfounded interest.] No! I'm good. Refreshed and ready to fight some firebenders! [Continues to work out and flex his body.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Props hand off hip. Responds dryly.] I was talking to Appa. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Instantly halts exercise.] Well ... I was talking to Momo. [Points to the lemur clinging to a dead tree's branch.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene cut to Katara, Sokka, Aang, and Momo walking along the stone bridge to approach a multi-story Fire Temple. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Close-up, top-to-bottom view of the Fire Temple.] I don't see any guards. \n",
      "KATARA: [Camera drops to show the group taking cover behind a lower wall below steps.] The Fire Nation must have abandoned the temple when Avatar Roku died. \n",
      "AANG: It's almost sundown. We better hurry! [The group leaps over the wall and charges for the front door.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [The group tip-toes through an enormous chamber with fire-decor columns.] Wait. I think I heard something. \n",
      "GREAT.FIRE.SAGE: [Turning around, they see five men standing in the hallway dressed in red with tall hats.] We are the Fire Sages. Guardians of the temple of the Avatar. \n",
      "AANG: Great! I am the Avatar! \n",
      "GREAT.FIRE.SAGE: We know. [Inhales briskly before punching a blast of fire their direction.] \n",
      "AANG: [Deflects three balls of fire with his airbending. Close-up. Shouts over his shoulder.] I'll hold them off. Run! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang leaps forward and spins his leg across the ground, sending a low air blade that sweeps the Fire Sages' legs out from beneath them, and they all fall to the ground. Aang flees after his friends. \n",
      "GREAT.FIRE.SAGE: If the Avatar contacts Roku, there's no telling how powerful the boy will become! Split up and find him. \n",
      "AANG: [Hallway view; Aang skids in front of Katara and Sokka and continues running.] Follow me! \n",
      "SOKKA: Do you know where you're going? [The two follow Aang.] \n",
      "AANG: [Rounds a corner and disappears from sight.] Nope! [A moment passes, Katara and Sokka stop when Aang skids into view again. Fearfully.] Wrong way! [Runs past them.] \n",
      "SHYU: [Rounds the corner, frightening Sokka and Katara to chase after Aang.] Come back! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The trio turns another corner and charges down the hallway. However, they reach a dead-end as Aang skids to an immediate halt. Turning around, they face Shyu, who raises a hand in peace. \n",
      "SHYU: I don't want to fight you! I am a friend. \n",
      "SOKKA: Firebenders aren't our friends! [Aang steps ahead of his friends, assuming an airbending posture.] \n",
      "SHYU: [Steps toward the Avatar, before dropping to his knees and pressing his palms to the floor in submission. This startles Aang, Katara, and Sokka.] I know why you're here, Avatar. \n",
      "AANG: [Surprised.] You do? \n",
      "SHYU: Yes. [Rises from the floor to stand again.] You wish to speak to Avatar Roku. I can take you to him. \n",
      "AANG: [Skeptically.] How? \n",
      "SHYU: [Slides back a lamplight on the wall. Places palm on wall, focuses firebending into this location to open a secret passage.] This way. \n",
      "GREAT.FIRE.SAGE: [Echoes in the distance.] Find him. \n",
      "SHYU: [Briefly glances down the hall.] Time is running out! Quickly! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang and Katara exchange a look with one another, asserting each other's belief to trust this firebender. The group enters the passage and descends the steps into the cave. Shyu enters behind them and closes the passageway. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Close-up. Tightens knuckles on ship's railing. Smoke billows behind his ship.] What's he up to, Uncle? Why didn't Commander Zhao arrest me? \n",
      "IROH: Because he wants to follow you. He knows you'll lead him to the prize you're both after: the Avatar. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Close-up.] If Zhao wants to follow a trail of smoke, then that's exactly what I'll let him do. \n",
      "SHYU: [Brief scene cut to show the sun nearly setting. Far overhead view of Shyu leading the group through caverns.] Avatar Roku once called this temple his home. He formed these secret passages out of the magma. \n",
      "AANG: Did you know Avatar Roku? \n",
      "SHYU: No. But my grandfather knew him. Many generations of Fire Sages guarded this Fire Temple long before me. We all have a strong spiritual connection to this place. \n",
      "AANG: Is that how you knew I was coming? \n",
      "SHYU: A few weeks ago, an amazing thing occurred. The statue of Avatar Roku; its eyes began to glow! \n",
      "KATARA: That's when we were at the Air Temple. Avatar Roku's eyes were glowing there, too! \n",
      "SHYU: At that moment, we knew you had returned to the world. \n",
      "AANG: If this is the Avatar's temple, why did the sages attack me? \n",
      "SHYU: Things have changed. In the past, the sages were loyal only to the Avatar. When Roku died, the sages eagerly awaited for the next Avatar to return. But he never came. \n",
      "AANG: [Looking down, guiltily.] They were waiting for me. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Humorously mocking.] Hey don't feel bad. You're only a hundred years late! [Aang scowls heavily at Sokka.] \n",
      "SHYU: They lost hope the Avatar would ever return. When Fire Lord Sozin began the War, my grandfather and the other sages were forced to follow him. [Shakes head sadly.] I never wanted to serve the Fire Lord. When I learned you were coming, I knew I would have to betray the other sages. \n",
      "AANG: Thank you for helping me. [Close-up as Shyu smiles to Aang.] \n",
      "SHYU: [Continues leading the group up a spiraling flight of stairs.] We'll follow these stairs to the sanctuary. [Time skip, Shyu continues talking as they near the top of the stairs.] Once you're inside, wait for the light to hit Avatar Roku's statue. Only then will you be able to speak with him. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Slides back a secret tile and climbs into the outer sanctuary. Massive columns with dragon statues atop them line the room. An immense door is before them with a device holding five open-mouthed dragons. \n",
      "SHYU: [Gasps.] No! \n",
      "AANG: [Approaches door.] Shyu, what's wrong? \n",
      "SHYU: The sanctuary doors, they're closed! \n",
      "KATARA: [Aang tugs at the door uselessly.] Can't you just open them with firebending? Like you opened that other door? \n",
      "SHYU: No. Only a fully realized Avatar is powerful enough to open this door alone. Otherwise, the sages must open this door together, [Sokka shown in deep thought.] with five simultaneous fire blasts. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Ponderously states.] Five fire blasts, huh? [Zoom out to show a lamplight above him.] I think I can help you out. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene switches to Zuko's smoke-billowing ship. Close-up to show a small vessel holding Zuko being slid into the waters. \n",
      "ZUKO: Uncle, keep heading north. Zhao will follow the smoke trail, while I use it as a cover. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Iroh grunts in doubt, stroking his beard in deep thought. Zuko's boat settles on the ocean's surface and disappears in the smoke. Switch to a telescope view of nothing but smoke. Zhao lowers telescope, staring with determination.\n",
      "Switch to view of sanctuary door. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Kneeling. Pours oil into a bag.] This is a little trick I picked up from my father. I seal the lamp oil inside an animal skin casing, Shyu lights the oil soaked twine and, [Picks up bag, holds it proudly before him.] ta-da! Fake firebending! \n",
      "KATARA: [Impressed.] You've really outdone yourself this time, Sokka. \n",
      "SHYU: This might actually work. \n",
      "SHYU: [Time skip. Sokka places his last bag into the dragon's mouth.] The sages will hear the explosion, so as soon as they go off, you rush in! \n",
      "KATARA: [Hides behind a column with her brother. Holds Momo. Glances to the next column where Aang hides.] It's almost sunset. Are you ready? \n",
      "AANG: Definitely. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Shyu thrusts his finger forward, sending a small flare racing across the door to light all five bags at once. Shyu hurries to take cover. There is an intense explosion, producing a lot of smoke. Aang bursts forward and runs for the door. Aang strains to open the door, which has not budged. \n",
      "AANG: [Surprised.] They're still locked! \n",
      "SHYU: [Sadly sighs. Sokka rises from hiding behind his sister.] It didn't work. [Aang falls to his knees.] \n",
      "AANG: [Time skip. Everyone stands in front of the door. Aang beats upon it furiously with consecutive airbending slices.] Why, won't, it, open?! \n",
      "KATARA: [Presses forward. Seizes Aang's arm.] Aang! Stop! [Relaxes, releasing his arm.] There's nothing else we can do ... \n",
      "AANG: [Glumly.] I'm sorry I put you through all of this for nothing. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Examining the explosion. Runs his finger across the black soot.] I don't get it. That firebending looked as strong as any firebending I've seen. \n",
      "KATARA: [A moment passes. Sudden excitement.] Sokka, you're a genius! \n",
      "AANG: [Confused.] Wait. How is Sokka a genius? His plan didn't even work. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Pleasantly.] Come on Aang. Let her dream. \n",
      "KATARA: You're right. Sokka's plan didn't work. But it looks like it did. \n",
      "AANG: [Dubiously.] Did the definition of genius change over the last hundred years? [Katara grasps her chin, slyly grinning toward Aang.] \n",
      "SHYU: [Time skip. Fire Sages run toward Shyu in front of the door.] Come quickly! The Avatar has entered the sanctuary! \n",
      "GREAT.FIRE.SAGE: How did he get in? \n",
      "SHYU: I don't know. But look at the scorch marks! And down there! [Points to a shadow visible at the bottom of the door.] \n",
      "GREAT.FIRE.SAGE: He's inside! Open the doors, immediately! Before he contacts Avatar Roku! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang slides into position behind a nearby column as the five sages firebend the doors locks open. As the door opens, a sooty Momo is revealed sitting on the floor. Momo sneezes, blowing the soot off himself. \n",
      "GREAT.FIRE.SAGE: It's the Avatar's lemur. He must have crawled through the pipes! We've been tricked! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo springs into action, leaping atop the Great Fire Sage's head and clinging to his hat. Katara charged forward, pulling a nearby sage's tunic over his head to blind him. Sokka grabs the lower skirt of a sage's outfit, lifting it completely over his body to cover his face. \n",
      "SHYU: [Grabs the last free sage and hauls him into his grip, pinning him.] Now, Aang! \n",
      "KATARA: [A moment of silence.] Aang! Now's your chance! \n",
      "ZUKO: [Steps out from behind column. Grips Aang from behind, pinning Aang's arms behind him.] The Avatar's coming with me! [The captured sages use their captors' surprise to reclaim the upper hand, pinning their captors down. Momo flies off with the Great Fire Sage's hat.] Close the doors! Quickly! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Walking down steps, Aang glances over his shoulders to see Sokka and Katara being chained to a column. He breaks free, spinning behind Zuko to send him down the stairs with an airbending blast. Aang runs for Katara and Sokka. \n",
      "KATARA: [Chained. Sees him coming toward her. Turns head toward the closing door.] Go! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang listens without hesitation, turning to charge for the door guarded by two sages. He leaps into the air to avoid the Great Fire Sage's fire punch. Aang bounces off his hands from each of the two sage's heads before sailing through the door just as it closes. \n",
      "KATARA: [Pleased.] He made it! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Everyone looks away as the door seals with a blinding flash of white light. Inside, Aang is kneeling and looks up to a tall statue of Avatar Roku. A beam of red sunlight enters the room and strikes a glistening red jewel held by the statue. \n",
      "AANG: [Stands. Confused.] The light hits the statue and I talk to Roku. So why isn't anything happening? \n",
      "ZUKO: [He and four sages launch fire blasts into the door's locks. Nothing happens. Frustrated.] Why isn't it working, it's sealed shut? \n",
      "GREAT.FIRE.SAGE: It must have been the light. Avatar Roku doesn't want us inside. \n",
      "AANG: [Exasperated. Standing in the middle of the room, facing the statue.] Why isn't anything happening? I don't know what I'm doing! All I know is airbending! Please Avatar Roku, talk to me! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Roku's statue turns red as sunlight engulfs it. Its eyes glow white. View of Aang as smoke fills the room. When the white smoke dissipates Avatar Roku is standing before him, they are on a mountaintop and only clouds are visible below. \n",
      "ROKU: It's good to see you Aang. What took you so long? [Aang respectfully places a fist into his palm, bowing his head to the Avatar before him.] \n",
      "ZUKO: [Firmly to Shyu, who is kneeling before him with his hands behind his back.] Why did you help the Avatar? \n",
      "SHYU: [Sadly and proudly.] Because it was once the sages' duty. It is still our duty. \n",
      "ZHAO: [Claps. Interrupts interrogation. Approaches with six firebender guards.] What a moving and heartfelt performance. I'm certain the Fire Lord will understand, when you explain why you betrayed him. \n",
      "GREAT.FIRE.SAGE: [Places palms together. Bows head forward.] Commander Zhao. \n",
      "ZHAO: And Prince Zuko. It was a noble effort, but your little smokescreen didn't work. [Zuko scowls sharply. Firebenders step behind him, seizing his arms.] Two traitors in one day, the Fire Lord will be pleased. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Strains against his captor, snaps at Zhao.] You're too late, Zhao! The Avatar's inside and the doors are sealed. \n",
      "ZHAO: No matter. [Grins confidently.] Sooner or later, he has to come out. [Katara and Sokka share a worried glance.] \n",
      "ROKU: I have something very important to tell you, Aang. That is why, when you were in the Spirit World, I sent my dragon to find you. \n",
      "AANG: [Interested, curious.] Is it about that vision? The one of the comet? \n",
      "ROKU: Yes. \n",
      "AANG: What does it mean? \n",
      "ROKU: One hundred years ago, [Viewers see a visual of a comet in the dark sky.] Fire Lord Sozin used that comet to begin the War. He and his firebending army harnessed its incredible power, and dealt a deadly first strike against the other nations. \n",
      "AANG: [Close-up.] So the comet made them stronger? \n",
      "ROKU: [Close-up.] Yes. Stronger than you could even imagine. \n",
      "AANG: [Close-up.] But that happened a hundred years ago. What does the comet have to do with the War now? \n",
      "ROKU: Listen carefully. [Viewers see silhouette of Fire Lord Ozai standing amid flames, fists taut.] Sozin's Comet will return by the end of the summer, and Fire Lord Ozai will use its power to finish the War, once and for all. [Visual and audio of Ozai's silhouette roaring upward, fire streaming from his mouth.] If he succeeds, even the Avatar won't be able to restore balance to the world. Aang. You must defeat the Fire Lord, before the comet arrives. \n",
      "AANG: [Counters anxiously.] But I haven't even started learning waterbending! Not to mention earth and fire! \n",
      "ROKU: Mastering the elements takes years of discipline and practice. But if the world is to survive, you must do it by summer's end. [Close-up of a shocked Aang.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Firebenders, including Zhao and his crew, circle around the door's perimeter, assuming a firebending form. A monk chant begins for the audience only. They wait patiently for the door to open. \n",
      "ZHAO: When those doors open, [Shouts.] unleash all your firepower! \n",
      "KATARA: [Worried.] How's Aang gonna make it out of this? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Troubled, questioning.] How are we gonna make it out of this? \n",
      "AANG: [Terrified.] What if I can't master all the elements in time? What if I fail? \n",
      "ROKU: I know you can do it Aang. [Close-up of half his face.] For you have done it before. [Close-up of half of Aang's now-smiling face.] The solstice is ending. We must go our separate ways, for now. \n",
      "AANG: But I won't be able to come back to the temple. What if I have questions? How will I talk to you? \n",
      "ROKU: I am a part of you. When you need to talk to me again, you will find a way. [Closes his eyes, providing Aang a vision of Fire Navy ships surrounding the island. Speaks to his mind without words.] A great danger awaits you at the temple. [Provides a vision of the awaiting firebenders on the other side of the door.] I can help you face the threat. But only if you are ready. \n",
      "AANG: [Eyes and arrows glow.] I'm ready. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene switches to the guard surrounding the door. The door glows bright white once again. Smoke streams come through into the room. The door unlocks itself, beginning to open. As it opens, a blinding white light forces all present to look away. \n",
      "ZHAO: Ready ... [Light fades, revealing a pair of glowing white eyes in the darkness.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Sokka struggles against his chains. Katara is terrified.] No! Aang! \n",
      "ZHAO: Fire! [He and his guards cooperate in blasting fire onto the unseen target.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The wall of fire amasses, circling its new host as Avatar Roku, eyes aglow, is revealed behind the flames, untouched. Close-up of a shocked and horror-stricken Zhao. \n",
      "SHYU: [In awe.] Avatar Roku ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Avatar Roku draws the circling fire together in one motion. He sends it forward in one powerful wave that sears the room, blasting the offenders off their feet and melting the chains binding Katara, Sokka, Shyu, and Zuko with precision. View of outside the temple as the blast destroys the outer wall. Close-up of ghostly Avatar Roku, turning his glowing glare upon the offending sages. The sages panic, all turning to run from his wrath. \n",
      "SHYU: [Implores.] Avatar Roku is going to destroy the temple! We have to get out of here! \n",
      "KATARA: Not without Aang! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Roku kneels into a forward strike, melting the floor with a molten firebending trail. He steadily lifts his hand, causing the stream of lava below to erupt into maddened explosions. The lava soars through the temple, tearing it apart. Zhao and his firebenders are shown fleeing for the temple's exit.\n",
      "Katara and Sokka huddle together, arm-in-arm, behind a column. Sokka kneels over his sister, protecting her in a brotherly fashion. The destruction ceases momentarily as Roku lowers his hands, exhaling soundly. The solstice' beam of sunlight is shown leaving his statue; its eyes no longer glow. As this happens all smoke in the room draws in upon Avatar Roku, his form disappearing to leave behind a weary Aang. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Aang sighs weakly and drops to his knees. Sokka and Katara approach Aang's sides, supportively lifting him back to his feet.] We got your back. \n",
      "AANG: [Weakly.] Thanks. Where's Shyu? \n",
      "KATARA: [ Walking away with Sokka, helping Aang.] I don't know. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Visual of the temple as it begins to lean, due to the destruction caused. Aang, Katara and Sokka stare in horror upon seeing the stairwell leading to the exit filled with lava. They quickly turn to the only exit; the hole in the wall Roku had created. There is no escaping, as they are on the top level of the temple.\n",
      "All three gasp in surprise as they notice Appa and Momo swiftly closing in. They run out of the temple, leaping into Appa's saddle. Scene of them flying away on Appa, gazing back at the destruction. Momo pops up wearing the Great Fire Sage's hat. Scene of Zhao watching the bison fly away. \n",
      "ZHAO: [Turns angrily, snapping.] No Prince, no Avatar! Apparently, the only thing I do have is five traitors! \n",
      "GREAT.FIRE.SAGE: [Interjects.] But Commander! Only Shyu helped the Avatar. \n",
      "ZHAO: [Close-up.] Save your stories for the Fire Lord. As far as I'm concerned, you are all guilty! [Orders.] Take them to the prison hold! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to show Zuko spying with his telescope toward Appa flying away. He lowers the telescope and sails off in his vessel.\n",
      "Night time falls. Appa flies through the clouds. Scene from behind, a mourning Aang with his head hung. Katara and Sokka stand and approach their friend, kneeling behind him to support him. Katara puts her hand around Aang's shoulders. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fades to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene opens with the camera zoomed out showing Appa flying in above the mountains with a few viewable trees, carrying Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Momo. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Aang is pacing around on Appa's saddle, breathing heavily.] Would you sit down? [Turns around from his perch on Appa's head.] If we hit a bump, you'll go flying off. What's bugging you anyway? \n",
      "AANG: [Worriedly.] It's what Avatar Roku said. I'm supposed to master all four elements before that comet arrives. \n",
      "SOKKA: [In a sarcastic, amused tone while facing Aang.] Well, let's see. You pretty much mastered airbending and that only took you a hundred and twelve years. I'm sure you can master three more elements by next summer. \n",
      "AANG: [Frightfully.] I haven't even started waterbending and we're still weeks away from the North Pole. What am I gonna do? \n",
      "KATARA: [Grabs Aang's arm.] Calm down, it's going to be okay. [Aang sits down in front of her.] If you want, I can try to teach you some of the stuff I know. \n",
      "AANG: [Smiling.] You'd do that? \n",
      "KATARA: [Nods and looks over the side of Appa's saddle.] We'll need to find a good source of water first. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Grinning; sarcastically.] Maybe we can find a puddle for you to splash in. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Momo standing in front of a large waterfall and river. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Frowning beside Aang and Katara's ecstatic faces.] Nice puddle. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa flies down into the river and creates a huge splash that soaks and almost knocks Momo of the rock he is standing on, turns over, and floats on his back. \n",
      "AANG: [Takes off his shirt, smiling.] Yeah! Don't start without me, boy! [Begins to run toward the water.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Somewhat blankly.] Remember the reason we're here. \n",
      "AANG: [Stops short and looks at Katara.] Oh right. Time to practice waterbending. [Puts his clothes back on.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sarcastically.] Great. So what am I supposed to do? \n",
      "AANG: You could ... clean the gunk out of Appa's toes. [Hands Sokka a branch with a bushel of leaves at the end.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Frowns and crosses his arms.] So, while you guys are playing in the water, I'm supposed to be hard at work picking mud out of a giant bison's feet? \n",
      "AANG: [Smiles; somewhat cheerfully.] Mud and bugs! \n",
      "SOKKA: Okay. [Takes stick and walks over to Appa who is floating in the water.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to Zuko's ship in the ocean. On the deck, Zuko is practicing firebending with his  Lieutenant Lee when the boat turns and they are thrown to one side on their backs. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Close-up of his face; he glares at the tower.] Someone's changing our course. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to a crew member steering the ship at the top of the boat. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Storming in, yelling.] What is the meaning of this mutiny? No one told you to change course! [Shows Iroh and the rest of the crew playing Pai Sho behind them.] \n",
      "IROH: Actually, someone did. I assure you, it is a matter of utmost importance, Prince Zuko. [Scratches beard.] \n",
      "ZUKO: [Hopefully.] Is it something to do with the Avatar? \n",
      "IROH: Even more urgent. It seems, I- [Rubs forehead in stress.] -I have lost my lotus tile. [Moves a piece of his across the Pai Sho board.] \n",
      "ZUKO: [Confused.] Lotus tile? \n",
      "IROH: For my Pai Sho game. Most people think the lotus tile insignificant, but it is essential for the unusual strategy that I employ. \n",
      "ZUKO: [In disbelief.] You've changed our course for a stupid lotus tile? \n",
      "IROH: See, you, like most people, underestimate it's value. Just give me ten minutes to check the merchants at this port of call. [Excitedly.] Hopefully, they will have the lotus tile in stock and I can get on with my life. [Zuko breathes fire up at the ceiling in anger and Iroh smiles.] I'm lucky to have such an understanding nephew. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The room fills with smoke of Zuko's outburst, clouding the scene from view.\n",
      "Cut to a scene of a content Appa floating in the river while Sokka stands on his stomach and brushes in between his toes with the branch. \n",
      "SOKKA: Yeah, don't get too happy. You've got to do me next. [Appa moans happily.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Shows Katara and Aang by the shore. \n",
      "KATARA: This is a pretty basic move, but is still took me months to perfect. So don't get frustrated if you don't get it right away. [She moves her hands back and forth and makes small waves in the water, while Aang looks up, smiling.] Just push and pull the water like this. The key is getting the wrist movement right. \n",
      "AANG: [Stands up.] Like this? [Does the hand movements Katara is doing, but nothing is happening yet.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Kindly.] That's almost right. If you keep practicing I'm sure eventually— \n",
      "AANG: Hey, I'm bending it already! [Shows Aang making much bigger waves than Katara's on his first try.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Surprised.] Wow, I can't believe you got that so quickly. It took me two months to learn that move. \n",
      "AANG: [Shrugs shoulders.] Well, you had to figure it all on your own. I'm lucky enough to have a great teacher. \n",
      "KATARA: [Smiles.] Thanks. \n",
      "AANG: So, what's next? \n",
      "KATARA: This is a more difficult move. I call it streaming the water. [She moves her hands and raises a stream of water from the river into the air and moves it around.] It's harder than it looks, so don't be disappointed if- [Shows Aang already controlling a stream of water, moving it around and above his body and neatly coiling it back into the river, much to Katara's dismay.] Nice work. [She frowns.] Though the over-the-head flare was unnecessary. \n",
      "AANG: Sorry. [Excited.] Well, don't stop now! Keep 'em coming! \n",
      "KATARA: [Looks up sadly.] Well I kind of know this one other move, but it's pretty hard. I haven't even totally figured it out yet. The idea is to create a big, powerful wave. [She moves her hands up, shaking, and starts to get a big mass of water to rise out of the river, but it pops before forming into anything substantial.] \n",
      "AANG: So, like this? [He raises his hands and creates a massive wave that towers over their heads.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Still working on cleaning up Appa, he looks up and stares at Aang's wave crashing toward him in fear.] Aang?! [The wave throws Sokka off into the water and his head slowly rises out, annoyed.] \n",
      "AANG: [Smiling.] Looks like I got the hang of that move! What else do you got? \n",
      "KATARA: [Angry at Aang's quick success.] That's enough practicing for today. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Head still sticking out of the water.] Yeah, I'll say! [Points to the left.] You just \"practiced\" our supplies down the river. [Shows a group of bags floating away.] \n",
      "AANG: [Looking guilty.] Uh, sorry. [Smiles worriedly.] I'm sure we can find somewhere to replace all this stuff. \n",
      "SOKKA: My life was hard enough when you were just an airbender. [Sinks back underwater.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to Katara, Sokka, and Aang walking through the streets of a city market and port. Shows many armed men staring at the trio. Sokka and Katara look nervous while Aang looks around in wonder. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Walking back from alleyway with a bag over his shoulders.] We've got exactly three copper pieces left from the money that King Bumi gave us. Let's spend it wisely. \n",
      "AANG: Uh, make that two copper pieces, Sokka. I couldn't say no to this whistle! [Pulls out a white whistle that looks like a bison, takes a huge breath and blows into it, but it barely makes a sound.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Pulls out fingers over his ears after expecting a loud noise.] It doesn't even work. [Aang stops blowing when Momo squawks at him.] See? Even Momo thinks it's a piece of junk. \n",
      "KATARA: No offense Aang, but I'll hold the money from now on. [Aang hands her the two copper coins.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to the other side of the port where a man is talking in front of his boat docked in the water. \n",
      "OH: [Moving hands and shouting excitedly.] Earth Nation! Fire Nation! Water Nation! So long as bargains are your inclination, you're welcome here! Don't be shy, come on by! [Sokka, Katara, and Aang walk by and he runs up to them.] Oh! You there, I can see from your clothing that you're world-traveling types. Perhaps I can interest you in some exotic curios? \n",
      "AANG: [Walks back to the man.] Sure! What are curios? \n",
      "OH: [Looks confused and thinks.] I'm not entirely sure. But we got 'em! [Puts his hand on Aang's shoulder and smiles, walking him into the ship.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to the inside of the boat where strange collectibles are lined up on shelves on the walls. Aang, Katara, and Sokka walk in. \n",
      "AANG: [Looks up close at an item on a shelf, confused.] Huh? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara stares at an ornate monkey statue on one of the shelves eerily. \n",
      "PIRATE.CAPTAIN: [Standing in a dark doorway as Aang passes by with Momo on his back.] I've never seen such a fine specimen of lemur. [Walks into the light, an iguana parrot on his shoulder.] That beast would fetch me a hefty sum if you'd be interested in bartering. [The iguana parrot squawks at them.] \n",
      "AANG: [Grabbing Momo.] Momo's not for sale. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Shows Katara walking over to a shelf where a number of scrolls are kept. She grabs one with the waterbending symbol on it and opens it to see lines of waterbending diagrams and writing. \n",
      "KATARA: [Smiling.] Look at this, Aang. It's a waterbending scroll! [Aang walks over.] Check out these crazy moves. \n",
      "AANG: [Turns to the captain, excited.] Where did you get a waterbending scroll? \n",
      "PIRATE.CAPTAIN: [Slams his hand onto the scroll and pulls it away.] Let's just say I got it up North, at a most reasonable price, free. [Rolls the scroll back up and puts it away back in its shelf.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Turns around and looks at the captain from the other side of the room.] Wait a minute ... Sea loving traders, with suspiciously acquired merchandise, [Raises eyebrows, almost yelling.] and pet reptile birds? [Turns around to Oh, almost spitting in his face.] You guys are pirates! \n",
      "OH: [Puts his arm around a terrified Sokka's shoulders.] We prefer to think of ourselves as \"high risk traders.\" \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to Katara holding their two copper pieces next to Aang, with the captain on the other side of the counter they are leaning on. \n",
      "KATARA: So, how much for the, uh, traded scroll? \n",
      "PIRATE.CAPTAIN: I've already got a buyer, a nobleman in the Earth Kingdom. [Voice turns less serious.] Unless of course, you kids have two hundred gold pieces on you right now. \n",
      "AANG: [Turns around and whispers to Katara.] I know how to deal with these guys, Katara. Pirates love to haggle. [Katara drops the final coins in his hand.] Watch and learn. [Walks over to the counter, leans against it, and talks in a pirate voice.] Let's say to the price of, one copper piece! [Smiles, and dramatically presents the single coin.] \n",
      "PIRATE.CAPTAIN: [Laughs hysterically.] The price is two hundred gold pieces. I don't haggle on items this rare. \n",
      "AANG: [Still smirking and talking like a pirate.] Okay, two copper pieces! \n",
      "PIRATE.CAPTAIN: [Aggravated.] It's not as amusing the second time, boy! \n",
      "KATARA: [Whispering.] Aang, can we get out of here? I feel like we're getting weird looks. \n",
      "AANG: Aye, we be casting off now! [Walks away.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts back to outside, Aang, Katara, and Sokka are walking off the boat and back down the street. \n",
      "AANG: What was that all about, Katara? \n",
      "SOKKA: Yeah, I was just starting to browse through their boomerang collection. \n",
      "KATARA: [Worried, holding her arms.] I'll just feel a lot better once we get away from here. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts back to the pirate ship. Oh is running across the deck looking for them. \n",
      "OH: Hey you! Get back here! \n",
      "AANG: [Calmly turns around.] Well, well. Look who's come to their senses. Told you the haggling would pay off. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Suddenly, the group of armed pirates jump out of the boat and run to Aang, Katara, and Sokka, whispering menacingly and swinging their weapons. \n",
      "KATARA: [Scared.] I don't think these pirates are here to trade with us. [Turns around and runs, Aang and Sokka follow and the pirates chase behind them. Half of the group runs down one street while the other goes down the one next to it.] \n",
      "OH: This way. Let's cut 'em off! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Turning a corner with Aang and Katara.] Whoa! [Katara freezes a puddle behind them that a pirate slips on.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to peaceful scene of the cabbage merchant with his cart of cabbages in an alleyway. Sokka, Katara, and Aang run past him and almost knock his cart over. Aang sends a blast of wind that throws the cart into the group of pirates behind them. \n",
      "CABBAGE.MERCHANT: [Angry.] My cabbages! This place is worse than Omashu! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Group of pirates jump out of another street and chase Aang, Sokka, Katara, and Momo. \n",
      "PIRATE: I hope that lemur of yours has nine lives! \n",
      "OH: [Him and the pirates corner them in the dead end of a street.] Now, who gets to taste the steel of my blade first? \n",
      "AANG: No thanks. [Spins and hurls a blast of air at the pirates that send them backward, and runs toward them with his glider out.] Grab on tight! \n",
      "KATARA: Aang! I thought we were running away from the pirates! [Jumps on to Aang's glider with Sokka and they lift off into the air.] \n",
      "AANG: Just hang on! [Flies over the pirates' heads and into the distance.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts back to their camp by the river, where Aang, Sokka, and Katara stand by the shore. \n",
      "AANG: [Putting his glider away.] I used to kind of look up to pirates, but those guys are terrible. \n",
      "KATARA: [Mischievously.] I know. That's why I took this. [Holds out the waterbending scroll they saw in the shop.] \n",
      "AANG: [Surprised.] No way! \n",
      "KATARA: [Excited.] Isn't it great? \n",
      "SOKKA: No wonder they were trying to hack us up! You stole their waterbending scroll! \n",
      "KATARA: [Jokingly.] I prefer to think of it as high risk trading. \n",
      "AANG: [Laughs.] Good one, Katara. \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka, where do you think they got it? They stole it from a waterbender! \n",
      "SOKKA: It doesn't matter. You put all of our lives in danger just so you could learn some stupid, fancy splashes. \n",
      "KATARA: These are real waterbending forms. You know how crucial it is for Aang to learn waterbending! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Walks away.] Whatever. \n",
      "AANG: Well, what's done is done. We have it, we might as well learn from it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to show Zuko and Iroh standing in the market place. \n",
      "IROH: I've checked all the shops on this pier. Not a lotus tile in the entire marketplace. \n",
      "ZUKO: It's good to know this trip was a complete waste of time for everyone! \n",
      "IROH: Quite the contrary. I always say, the only thing better than finding something you are looking for [Crew members begin to walk past carrying Iroh's purchases.] is finding something you weren't looking for at a great bargain! [A crew member walks past the two playing a tsungi horn.] \n",
      "ZUKO: You bought a tsungi horn? \n",
      "IROH: For music night on the ship. Now, if we only had some woodwinds. [Pointing to the ship.] Oh, this place looks promising! [The monkey statue is shown again.] Oh, that is handsome! Wouldn't it look magnificent in the galley? \n",
      "OH: [To pirate captain.] We lost the Water Tribe girl and the little bald monk she was traveling with. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Turning.] This monk, did he have an arrow on his head? [Iroh turns around, making a face similar to the monkey's.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera cuts show Katara looking at the scroll. \n",
      "KATARA: I just want to try this one move first and then it's all yours. [Gives it to Aang.] Here, hold it open for me. The single water whip. Looks doable. [Attempts the move, but ends up hitting herself in the forehead.] Ow! \n",
      "SOKKA: Ha, ha, ha! \n",
      "KATARA: [Glaring at Sokka.] What's so funny? \n",
      "SOKKA: I'm sorry, but you deserved that. [To Aang.] You've been duped; she's only interested in teaching herself. \n",
      "KATARA: [Angrily.] Aang will get his turn once I figure out the water whip. [She tries again, but hits Momo instead, who screeches.] Ugh, why can't I get this stupid move? \n",
      "AANG: You'll get it. [Katara glares at him.] You just gotta shift your weight through the stances. [He tries and does it perfectly on the first try.] There, see, the key to bending is— \n",
      "KATARA: [Screaming.] Will you please shut your air hole? Believe it or not your infinite wisdom gets a little old sometimes! Why don't we just throw the scroll away since you're so naturally gifted! [Sokka glares at her.] What? [She looks back at Aang, who has tears in his eyes.] Oh my gosh, Aang, I am so sorry, I don't know what came over me. But you know what, it won't happen again. [She gives the scroll to Aang.] Here, this is yours. I don't want to have anything to do with it anymore. \n",
      "AANG: It's okay Katara. \n",
      "SOKKA: What about Momo? He's the real victim here. \n",
      "KATARA: [Bends down to pet Momo as he rubs his hind end.] I'm sorry, Momo. \n",
      "SOKKA: And what about me? There was that time you— \n",
      "KATARA: No more apologies! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera fades to show a much smaller boat being launched out of Zuko's ship. The camera fades again to show the boat and the pirate ship sailing down a river. \n",
      "PIRATE.CAPTAIN: Shouldn't we stop to search the woods? \n",
      "ZUKO: We don't need to stop. They stole a waterbending scroll, right? \n",
      "PIRATE.CAPTAIN: Mm-hm. \n",
      "ZUKO: Then they'll be on the water. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene fades to show Katara, Sokka, and Aang sleeping by the campfire. Katara quietly takes the scroll and sneaks away from the camp. However, when she turns around she comes face-to-face with Momo, who starts chattering. \n",
      "KATARA: [Whispering.] Shhh, Momo! Go back to sleep. Shh! [The camera fades to show her standing by the river, attempting but failing to perfect the water whip, frustrated.] Ugh, ugh, ugh! Shoot! Come on water, work with me here! Okay, what if I just, ow! Stupid scroll! [The pirate captain and Zuko are shown hearing her.] Okay Katara, shift your weight through the stances. [She drops the water again and hears the ship pulling up onto the river bank. She peaks through the bushes to see what the noise was, and gasps upon seeing the pirates. She turns to run, but it grabbed by a pirate.] No! Let go of me! [She bends water up into the pirate's face, and he releases her, she runs but is grabbed again on the wrists by Zuko.] \n",
      "ZUKO: [He glares at her as she looks frightfully at him.] I'll save you from the pirates. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to show Katara tied to a tree with Zuko standing in front of her. \n",
      "ZUKO: Tell me where he is and I won't hurt you or your brother. \n",
      "KATARA: [Furiously.] Go jump in the river! \n",
      "ZUKO: Try to understand. I need to capture him to restore something I've lost, my honor. [Katara jerks her head away from Zuko.] Perhaps in exchange I can restore something you've lost. [He holds her mother's necklace up to her neck.] \n",
      "KATARA: My mother's necklace! How did you get that? \n",
      "ZUKO: I didn't steal it, if that's what you're wondering. Tell me where he is. [Points at Katara.] \n",
      "KATARA: No! \n",
      "PIRATE.CAPTAIN: Enough of this necklace garbage! You promised a scroll! \n",
      "ZUKO: I wonder how much this is worth ... [The pirates gasp as he takes it out and holds it over a fire in his hand.] A lot, apparently. Now you help me find what I want, you'll get this back, and everyone goes home happy. Search the woods for the boy and meet back here! \n",
      "PIRATE.CAPTAIN: Fine. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to the campsite, where Sokka is waking up. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Notices Katara's missing.] Huh? Where did she go? [Looks through the bag.] I don't believe it. \n",
      "AANG: [Yawns.] What's wrong? \n",
      "SOKKA: She took the scroll! She's obsessed with that thing. It's just a matter of time before she gets us all in deep- [Yells as a pirate throws a rope around his arms and drags him forward. He rolls away and charges at the pirate while another pirate captures Aang in a net and drags him away.] \n",
      "PIRATE: I got him, come on! \n",
      "SOKKA: Oh, what? I'm not good enough to kidnap? Ah! [The pirate shoots another net at Sokka and drags him away too.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts back to the place where Zuko and the pirates are gathered. The pirates are holding Aang and Sokka, who are tied up. Sokka is struggling with the ropes. \n",
      "ZUKO: Nice work. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, this is all my fault. \n",
      "AANG: No Katara, it isn't. \n",
      "IROH: Yeah, it kind of is. [Katara glares at Iroh.] \n",
      "ZUKO: [To the pirate captain.] Give me the boy. \n",
      "PIRATE.CAPTAIN: You give us the scroll. \n",
      "SOKKA: You're really gonna hand over the Avatar for a stupid piece of parchment? \n",
      "ZUKO: Don't listen to him, he's trying to turn us against each other! \n",
      "PIRATE.CAPTAIN: [Turns to Aang.] Your friend is the Avatar? \n",
      "SOKKA: Sure is, and I'll bet he'll fetch a lot more on the black market than that fancy scroll. \n",
      "ZUKO: Shut your mouth, you Water Tribe peasant! \n",
      "AANG: Yeah, Sokka, you really should shut your mouth. \n",
      "SOKKA: I'm just sayin' it's bad business sense. Think how much the Fire Lord would pay for the Avatar. You guys would be set for life. \n",
      "PIRATE.CAPTAIN: [To Zuko.] Keep the scroll; we can buy a hundred with the reward we'll get for the kid. [The pirates turn to leave.] \n",
      "ZUKO: You'll regret breaking a deal with me. [He and two of his soldiers send a blast of fire at the pirates. The pirates jump back and Oh runs out, throwing smoke bombs and jumping into the cloud as the fight ensues. Some of the soldiers run out to Sokka and Aang, who are struggling with their ropes, but are stopped by several pirates. Momo runs down the tree and frees Katara.] \n",
      "KATARA: Thanks, Momo. I owe you a bushel of apples. [She runs to join the fight. Aang is shown lost in the smoke, a thrown knife narrowly misses him and cuts through his ropes. Zuko finds his way out of the smoke cloud and hides the scroll behind his back, but the pirate captain sees him and the two begin to fight. The scroll flies into the air and his caught by Momo, the iguana parrot sees him and hits Momo. The scroll flies back down to the ground. A knife narrowly misses Sokka's head, and he uses it to cuts the ropes on his hands.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Shouting.] Aang, are you there? \n",
      "AANG: I'm over here! Follow my voice! \n",
      "SOKKA: Where? I can't find you! \n",
      "AANG: I'm right here! [Airbends the dust away, revealing the pirates surrounding him, and immediately airbends it back around himself.] Never mind! I'll find you! [Sokka climbs out of the dust cloud on his hands and knees. Aang vaults over him in a full sprint.] Run! [They find Katara, who is trying to push the pirate boat back into the water.] Katara, you're okay! \n",
      "KATARA: Help me get this boat back in the water so we can get outta here. [They join her in trying to push the boat, but can't.] \n",
      "SOKKA: We'd need a team of rhinos to budge this ship. \n",
      "AANG: A team of rhinos, or two waterbenders. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to Aang and Katara pushing and pulling the water until the boat rises up. \n",
      "KATARA: Everybody in! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to show Iroh breaking up the fight between the pirate captain and Zuko. \n",
      "IROH: Are you so busy fighting you cannot see your own ship has set sail? \n",
      "ZUKO: We have no time for your proverbs, Uncle! \n",
      "IROH: It's no proverb! [Points to Team Avatar who has hijacked the pirate ship.] \n",
      "PIRATE.CAPTAIN: Bleeding hog monkeys! [Zuko laughs while pointing at him. His laughter dissipates as the pirates hijack his own boat. The pirates taunt him and the screen pans to a steaming Zuko.] \n",
      "ZUKO: [Angrily.] Hey! That's my boat! [Goes chasing after the hijacked boat.] \n",
      "IROH: [Pondering.] Maybe it should be a proverb ... \n",
      "ZUKO: [Off camera.] C'mon, Uncle! [Iroh runs after Zuko.] \n",
      "AANG: Sokka, can't you make it go any faster? \n",
      "SOKKA: I don't know how. This thing wasn't made by the Water Tribe! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Several of the pirates jump onto the ship, but are quickly swept away by Aang's waterbending. Determined, Katara performs a perfect water whip to throw the last pirate off. \n",
      "AANG: Hey, you did the water whip! \n",
      "KATARA: I couldn't have done it without your help. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka is shown being held in place by two pirates. \n",
      "SOKKA: Would you two quit congratulating each other and help me out? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo is shown still being chased by the iguana parrot; he flies up to the top mast and entangles the bird in the ship's flag. Sokka is shown being thrown by one of the pirates. \n",
      "OH: That's good ... [Aang lands behind him and airbends him and the other pirate off the ship before jumping down to Sokka.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Pointing.] Aang, look! [The ship is shown headed toward a huge waterfall.] \n",
      "AANG: Oh no ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Oh comes up behind him with a knife, Aang turns and blows the bison whistle. Oh stands confused while Sokka comes up behind him and pushes him off the ship. \n",
      "SOKKA: Have you lost your mind? This is no time for flute practice! [Katara and Aang stare in horror at the approaching waterfall.] \n",
      "KATARA: We can stop the boat! Aang, together, push and pull the water! [They create a small Whirlpool that stops the boat.] It's working, it's slowing down! We're doing it! \n",
      "SOKKA: But we have another problem. [Zuko's boat is shown sailing straight toward their ship. The boat rams into the ship and Sokka, Aang, and Katara are forced to jump as the boat goes over the falls.] \n",
      "TOGETHER: Jump! [Appa is shown flying toward them. They land on him and fly to safety.] \n",
      "AANG: [Holding up the whistle.] I knew a bison whistle would come in handy! Thanks Appa. \n",
      "SOKKA: Yeah, we owe you one. [Appa roars and the scene cuts to show Zuko running to the cliff in horror at the fact that his boat has gone over the falls.] \n",
      "ZUKO: My boat! \n",
      "IROH: [Chuckles.] Prince Zuko, you're really going to get a kick out of this. That lotus tile was in my sleeve the whole time! [Has a big smile on his face.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko snatches the lotus tile and furiously throws it down the waterfall. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts back to Appa flying through the clouds. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, I still owe you an apology. You were just so good at waterbending without really trying. I got so competitive that I put us all in danger, I'm sorry. \n",
      "AANG: That's okay Katara. \n",
      "KATARA: Besides, who needs that stupid scroll anyway? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Holding the scroll. Sarcastically.] Is that really how you feel? \n",
      "KATARA: The scroll! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Puts his hand in front to keep Katara from grabbing it.] First, what did you learn? \n",
      "KATARA: Stealing is wrong. [Snatches scroll.] Unless it's from pirates. \n",
      "AANG: [Laughing.] Good one, Katara. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fades to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens in a forest. Momo is chasing a bug through the trees. In his pursuit he lands on the ground to see a neatly stacked pile of lychee nuts. When he runs toward it, Momo is pulled into the air by a cage trap, joining two other caged animals. Camera changes focus to find the rest of Team Avatar camping. \n",
      "AANG: Where's Momo? [Camera zooms in to close-up shot of Aang, Katara, and Sokka, the siblings sitting next to each other with bored faces, and Aang standing with his back to the camera. Momo screeches and the gang looks around.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Camera fades to find Aang as he spots the three animals in their cage traps hanging by rope on tree limbs. \n",
      "AANG: Hang on, Momo! [Aang uses his airbending to fly to the top of the tree, jumping from trunk-to-trunk to get higher. He finds the traps' mechanisms, undoes them, and carefully lowers Momo to the ground where Katara and Sokka are waiting. They open the trap together and the lemur runs out with one of the lychee nuts in his mouth. Katara and Sokka look on as Momo gets on his hind legs and eats it as though nothing has happened. Sokka grunts in frustration and facepalms. When Aang lands, he looks up to see the other two animals seemingly crying out to him for help.] All right, you too. [Jumps up to them.] \n",
      "SOKKA: This is gonna take forever. [Throws his boomerang to simply cut the animals free.] \n",
      "AANG: [Inching his way upside-down to the traps on the tree branch. They fall before he can reach them.] That works. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The hog monkeys run up the tree and out of the camera's view and Aang jumps back down, dirt flying from the ground as he lands. Everyone gathers around two of the traps and Sokka kneels down to examine them. \n",
      "SOKKA: These are Fire Nation traps, [Camera zooms to upward shot of the gang looking at the trap.] you can tell from the metalwork. We better pack up camp, and get moving. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They gather their things and begin to pack them onto Appa's saddle. \n",
      "SOKKA: Uh uh. No flying this time. \n",
      "AANG: [Confused.] What? Why wouldn't we fly? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Takes the sleeping bag from Aang's hands.] Think about it: Somehow Prince Zuko and the Fire Nation keep finding us. It's because they spot Appa, he's just too noticeable. \n",
      "KATARA: What? Appa's not too noticeable! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Points dramatically at Appa; condescendingly.] He's a gigantic fluffy monster with an arrow on his head! It's kinda hard to miss him! [The bison yawns and the camera flashes to Aang sitting comfortably on the animal's head.] \n",
      "AANG: [To Appa.] Sokka's just jealous 'cause he doesn't have an arrow. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Camera closes in on Sokka and Katara next to each other.] I know you all wanna fly, but my instincts tell me we should play it safe this time and walk. \n",
      "KATARA: [Leans forward at her brother and smiles.] Who made you the boss? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Points his finger at his chest; to Katara.] I'm not the boss, I'm the leader. \n",
      "KATARA: [Amused.] You're the leader? But your voice still cracks! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Voice cracks.] I'm the oldest, and I'm a warrior, so [Deepens voice.] I'm the leader! \n",
      "KATARA: [Close-up shot of Katara's face.] If anyone's the leader, it's Aang. I mean he is the Avatar. [Pan back to Sokka.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Are you kidding, he's just a goofy kid! \n",
      "AANG: [While hanging upside-down from Appa's right horn with feet sticking out in the air.] He's right. \n",
      "KATARA: Why do boys always think someone has to be the leader? I bet you wouldn't be so bossy if you kissed a girl. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Close-up on Sokka; defensively.] I've kissed a girl, you just haven't met her. \n",
      "KATARA: [Back to Sokka.] Who? Gran-Gran? I've met Gran-Gran. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Throws arms into the air.] No! Besides Gran-Gran. Look, my instincts tell me we have a better chance of slipping through on foot, and a leader has to trust his instincts. \n",
      "KATARA: [Sarcastically.] Okay, we'll try it your way, oh wise leader. \n",
      "AANG: [Aang steps over, now wearing a backpack. Momo is sitting on the top.] Who knows? Walking might be fun. [Cut to the forest at a later time. Between trees the group trudges along, with Sokka in front, followed by Aang and Momo, Katara, and Appa.] Walking stinks! How do people go anywhere without a flying bison? \n",
      "KATARA: [Sarcastically.] Well I don't know, Aang. Why don't you ask Sokka's instincts? They seem to know everything. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sarcastically.] Ha, ha, very funny. \n",
      "AANG: [Complaining.] I'm tired of carrying this pack. \n",
      "KATARA: You know who you should ask to carry it for a while? Sokka's instincts. [Sokka's eyes turn to her in irritation.] \n",
      "AANG: That's a great idea. Hey, Sokka's instincts, would you mind- \n",
      "SOKKA: Okay, okay, I get it. Look guys, I'm tired too. But the important thing is that we're safe from the [Walks through a bush and sees something in front of him.] Fire ... Nation. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka sees a Fire Nation campsite with a lot of soldiers; most of them are seated or crouched near the fire with bowls in hand and a couple of them sit close to the tents, which have the Fire Nation emblem on the doorflap. One of these soldiers has a patch over his left eye. They all notice the group and get up. \n",
      "SOKKA: Run! [They turn to run but a firebender blocks them off by setting the plants behind them on fire.] We're cut off! \n",
      "AANG: Sokka, your shirt! [Sokka yells; Katara clears a fire on Sokka's shirt with waterbending.] \n",
      "SOKKA: If you let us pass, we promise not to hurt you. \n",
      "KATARA: [Whispers.] What are you doing? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Whispers.] Bluffing? \n",
      "EYE-PATCH.SOLDIER: You promise not to hurt us? [He's somehow knocked out.] \n",
      "AANG: Nice work, Sokka! How'd you do that? \n",
      "SOKKA: Uh, instinct? \n",
      "KATARA: [Points up a tree.] Look! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: In a tree, a man with hook swords, Jet, jumps and takes down two soldiers. He runs forward and takes down two more using his hook swords. \n",
      "JET: Down you go. [Katara looks amazed, Aang shocked, and Sokka confused.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Another soldier charges at Jet, but he is defeated. \n",
      "FIRE.NATION.SOLDIER: They're in the trees! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A young boy lands on top of the soldier and turns his helmet around to blind him, before riding him around while laughing. Another boy launches arrows at the soldiers while more boys come out of the trees. Aang and Katara are shown fighting the soldiers. Sokka holds up his boomerang and yells as one approaches him, but stops when Jet takes him down first. \n",
      "SOKKA: Hey, he was mine! \n",
      "JET: Gotta be quicker next time. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka looks dismayed and the camera cuts to show a huge boy fall out of the trees and easily take down two soldiers as Jet skillfully takes down one more, causing this soldier's weapon to hit another soldier, who was going to battle Sokka, in the head, making that soldier also fall down. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Angrily.] Man! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Jet disarms another soldier and runs up to Katara. \n",
      "JET: Hey. \n",
      "KATARA: Hi. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They look around to see a now empty camp \n",
      "AANG: [Amazed.] You just took out a whole army almost single-handed. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Disdainfully.] Army? There were only like, twenty guys. \n",
      "JET: My name is Jet, and these are my Freedom Fighters, Sneers, Longshot, Smellerbee, The Duke, and Pipsqueak. \n",
      "AANG: [Laughing; looking at The Duke.] Ha, ha, Pipsqueak, that's a funny name. [The Duke sniffs his nose, as the camera pans upward to Pipsqueak.] \n",
      "PIPSQUEAK: [Looming over Aang in a threatening manner; in a low, growling tone of voice.] You think my name is funny? \n",
      "AANG: [Side-shot; Aang looks taken aback for a second before replying in an upbeat tone.] It's hilarious! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Facial shot of Pipsqueak, still looming forward with a frown on his face. He suddenly starts laughing. The camera moves back, showing Aang and The Duke following suit. Pipsqueak pats the Avatar on the back in a friendly manner, though the hit was hard enough to knock Aang flat on the ground. The Duke stops laughing and looks down at Aang sprawled on the ground before his feet, face flat in the dirt, though when Aang raises his head and continues laughing, so does The Duke.\n",
      "The scene fades to the Fire Nation camp, and the camera cuts to show the Freedom Fighters raiding the empty camp. \n",
      "KATARA: [Approaching Jet.] Umm, thanks for saving us Jet. We're lucky you were there. \n",
      "JET: I should be thanking you. We were waiting to ambush those soldiers all morning, we just needed the right distraction, and then you guys stumbled in. \n",
      "KATARA: [Eyeing Sokka.] We were relying on instincts. \n",
      "JET: You'll get yourself killed doing that. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka looks at them disdainfully as The Duke and Pipsqueak look through the barrels. \n",
      "THE.DUKE: Hey Jet, these barrels are filled of blasting jelly. \n",
      "JET: That's a great score. \n",
      "PIPSQUEAK: And these boxes are filled with jelly candy! \n",
      "JET: Also good, let's not get those mixed up. \n",
      "THE.DUKE: We'll take this stuff back to the hideout. \n",
      "AANG: You guys have a hideout? \n",
      "JET: You wanna see it? \n",
      "KATARA: [Very excitedly.] Yes, we wanna see it! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Jet smiles at her and the camera fades to show them standing on the forest floor. \n",
      "JET: We're here. \n",
      "SOKKA: Where? There's nothing here. \n",
      "JET: Hold this. [Gives a rope to Sokka.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Skeptically.] Why? What's this do? [Screams as he is pulled up into the branches.] \n",
      "JET: Aang? [Offers Aang another rope.] \n",
      "AANG: I'll get up on my own. [Leaps up into the trees with airbending.] \n",
      "JET: Grab hold of me, Katara. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara blushes as she takes his hand and they rise up through the tree together in a romantic setting. They come to a landing on a wooden platform in the trees. Once up there, Aang is seen zip lining through the trees. \n",
      "AANG: [While passing through with Momo.] Nice place you got! \n",
      "KATARA: It's beautiful up here! \n",
      "JET: It's beautiful ... and more importantly the Fire Nation can't find us. [Smellerbee lands near the two.] \n",
      "SMELLERBEE: They would love to find you. Wouldn't they, Jet? \n",
      "JET: It's not gonna happen, Smellerbee. \n",
      "KATARA: [As Aang zips by again.] Why does the Fire Nation want to find you? \n",
      "JET: I guess you could say I've been causing them a little trouble. See, they took over a nearby Earth Kingdom town a few years back. \n",
      "PIPSQUEAK: We've been ambushin' their troops, cutting off their supply lines, and doing anything we can to mess with 'em. [Sokka is now seen comically hopping around trying to get past Pipsqueak.] \n",
      "JET: One day, we'll drive the Fire Nation out of here for good and free that town. \n",
      "KATARA: That's so brave. [Sokka manages to get by Pipsqueak.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sarcastically.] Yeah, nothing's braver than a guy in a tree house. \n",
      "KATARA: Don't pay any attention to my brother. \n",
      "JET: No problem. He probably had a rough day. \n",
      "KATARA: So, you all live here? [Sokka who is being ignored comically sinks back behind them.] \n",
      "JET: That's right. Longshot over there? [The screen cuts to Longshot and The Duke walking not making a sound.] His town got burned down by the Fire Nation. And we found The Duke trying to steal our food. I don't think he ever really had a home. \n",
      "KATARA: What about you? \n",
      "JET: [Katara and Jet come to a halt as the rest pass.] The Fire Nation killed my parents. I was only eight years old. That day changed me forever. \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka and I lost our mother to the Fire Nation. \n",
      "JET: I'm so sorry, Katara. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The screen fades from the two of them alone on the suspension bridge to the blue sky above the canopy. A cloud of cawing birds is disturbed as Appa raises his head with a roar. In the hideout, ropes with lanterns hang between branches. Sentries keep watch on several upper platforms while the group sits at a banquet table. While the group eats, Jet stands on the table. \n",
      "JET: Today, we struck another blow against the Fire Nation swine. [Everyone cheers. Katara and Aang smile while Sokka cops an attitude and a scowling face.] I got a special joy from the look on one soldier's face, when The Duke dropped down on his helmet and rode him like a wild hog monkey. [The Duke, without his helmet, climbs up the table. He marches on the table with his arms in the air.] Now, the Fire Nation thinks they don't have to worry about a couple of kids hiding in the trees. [He prepares to take a drink from his wooden cup.] Maybe they're right. [A very loud and long boo is heard; with an angry face.] Or maybe ... they're dead wrong. [A loud and long cheer is heard.] \n",
      "KATARA: Hey Jet, nice speech. \n",
      "JET: Thanks. By the way, I was really impressed with you and Aang. That was some great bending I saw out there today. \n",
      "KATARA: Well, he's great. He's the Avatar. [Blushes.] I could use some more training. \n",
      "JET: Avatar huh? Very nice. \n",
      "AANG: Thanks Jet. \n",
      "JET: So I might know a way that you and Aang can help in our struggle. \n",
      "SOKKA: Unfortunately, we have to leave tonight. [Sokka starts walking away.] \n",
      "JET: Sokka, you're kidding me! I needed you on an important mission tomorrow. [Sokka turns around.] \n",
      "SOKKA: What mission? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to the top of the forest the next day. Jet and Sokka are in branches of the same tree. Jet cups his hands and makes a birdcall; several trees down Pipsqueak and Smellerbee step into view from their branches. They reply with another birdcall. Sokka jams his jawbone knife into the trunk of the tree \n",
      "JET: What are you doing? \n",
      "SOKKA: Shh ... It amplifies vibrations. \n",
      "JET: [Impressed.] Good trick. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sokka puts his ear to the handle of his knife.] Nothing yet. [Whispers.] Wait! Yes, someone's approaching. \n",
      "JET: [Whispers.] How many? \n",
      "SOKKA: I think there's just one. \n",
      "JET: [Does a another birdcall.] Good work, Sokka. Ready your weapon. [Sokka takes his knife out of the tree. His eyes spot an old man.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Whispers.] Wait, false alarm ... He's just an old man. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Jet ignores Sokka and prepares to attack the old man, leaping to the ground in front of the traveler. Sokka watches with horror. \n",
      "JET: What are you doing in our woods, you leech? \n",
      "OLD.FIRE.NATION.CIVILIAN: Please sir, I'm just a traveler. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Jet takes a step, and with one swipe, sends the man's cane flying from his hand. The old man backs away, but when he tries to flee the way he came, he runs face first into Pipsqueak's chest. The force of the impact knocks him to the ground; Pipsqueak looms over him. He tries to crawl away, but Pipsqueak's foot on his backside effectively pins him. \n",
      "JET: Do you like destroying towns? Do you like destroying families? Do you? \n",
      "OLD.FIRE.NATION.CIVILIAN: Oh ... Please let me go ... have mercy ... \n",
      "JET: Does the Fire Nation let people go? Does the Fire Nation have mercy? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Jet is about to kick the man, but his foot is snagged by Sokka's club before it can be delivered. Sokka releases him. \n",
      "SOKKA: Jet, he's just an old man! \n",
      "JET: He's Fire Nation! Search him! [Pipsqueak holds the prisoner and Smellerbee steps up to search the poor man.] \n",
      "SOKKA: But he's not hurting anyone! \n",
      "JET: Have you forgotten that the Fire Nation killed your mother? Remember why you fight! \n",
      "SMELLERBEE: We've got his stuff, Jet. [She holds up the old man's bag. The old man is thrown back on the ground.] \n",
      "SOKKA: This doesn't feel right. \n",
      "JET: It's what has to be done, now let's get outta here. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Jet pushes past Sokka. Pipsqueak and Smellerbee follow. Sokka looks at the old man still on his hands and knees in pity. \n",
      "JET: Come on, Sokka! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka slowly turns and runs to catch up with the others. At the hideout, Aang and Momo are playing with the ziplines again. He leaps near Sokka. \n",
      "AANG: Sokka! Look what the Duke gave me! [Aang is wearing a bag and pulls a small pellet from it. With a sly grin, he tosses it next to Momo, where it explodes with a pop. Momo puffs up like a startled cat. He hisses and lunges for the bag. Momo sits on Aang's shoulder and tosses several pellets at his feet. Aang dances about wildly.] Ow! Quit it! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka is oblivious of it all. He's sitting with his back to the trunk and staring at the ground, glaring. Katara walks up. \n",
      "KATARA: Hey, Sokka. Is Jet back? \n",
      "SOKKA: Yeah he's back. But we're leaving. \n",
      "AANG: What? \n",
      "KATARA: But I made him this hat. [She shows a cap made out of stitched leaves with a flower on top.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Your boyfriend Jet's a thug. \n",
      "KATARA: What? No, he's not. \n",
      "SOKKA: He's messed up Katara. \n",
      "AANG: He's not messed up, he's just got a different way of life, a really fun way of life. \n",
      "SOKKA: He beat and robbed a harmless old man! \n",
      "KATARA: I wanna hear Jet's side of the story. [The scene changes to Jet in a room.] \n",
      "JET: Sokka, you told them what happened, but you didn't mention that the guy was Fire Nation? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Jet is sitting on a hammock-bed, the others stand. Sokka stands grumpily as far away as he can get. Aang is wearing the hat Katara made; he looks ridiculous and goofy. \n",
      "KATARA: No, he conveniently left that part out. \n",
      "SOKKA: Fine! But even if he was Fire Nation, he was a harmless civilian! \n",
      "JET: He was an assassin, Sokka. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Jet pulls out a knife and thrusts it into a nearby stump. It is a sinister looking curved blade. There are four spikes evenly spaced along the grip, with enough space for fingers to go between them. There is a ring on the butt of the knife. \n",
      "JET: See? There's a compartment for poison in the knife. [He pulls on the ring and removes a small glass tube filled with red liquid.]. He was sent to eliminate me; you helped save my life, Sokka. \n",
      "KATARA: I knew there was an explanation. \n",
      "SOKKA: I didn't see any knife! \n",
      "JET: That's because he was concealing it. \n",
      "KATARA: See, Sokka? I'm sure you just didn't notice the knife. \n",
      "SOKKA: There was no knife! I'm going back to the hut and packing my things. [Sokka stomps away.] \n",
      "JET: Tell me you guys aren't leaving yet. I really need your help. \n",
      "AANG: What can we do? \n",
      "JET: The Fire Nation is planning on burning down our forest. If you both use waterbending to fill the reservoir, we could fight the fires. But if you leave now, they'll destroy the whole valley. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang and Katara look at each other. Fade to them entering their hut. Sokka is tying up a mat on the floor. \n",
      "KATARA: We can't leave now with the Fire Nation about to burn down a forest! \n",
      "SOKKA: I'm sorry Katara. Jet's very smooth, but we can't trust him. \n",
      "KATARA: You know what I think? You're jealous that he's a better warrior and a better leader! \n",
      "SOKKA: Katara, I'm not jealous of Jet. It's just that my instinct— \n",
      "KATARA: Well my instincts tell me we need to stay here a little longer and help Jet. Come on Aang. \n",
      "AANG: Sorry, Sokka. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They leave the hut. Fade to the night sky above the canopy. A full moon shines on Appa, who is on his back and snoring extremely loud as he sleeps. Inside the Trio's hut, Sokka sleeps propped up against his still-packed gear while the others sleep in their sleeping bags. \n",
      "JET: Let's go. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka wakes up. He pulls the door flap aside enough to see some of Jet's followers descending on the rope lines. Sokka grabs a rope line down to a lower branch. On the ground below him, Jet's Freedom Fighters are quietly pushing the loaded wagon as Jet leads them out of the camp. Sokka stealthily follows. In the dark valley. Upstream, and up toward the wall of the valley there is an old falls, and beyond that a man-made dam. A bare cliff off to the reservoir's left provides the view. Jet and his boys emerge from the forest. He goes to the edge and looks down on the dam below. The reservoir behind it is low. He turns back to the wagon. \n",
      "JET: Now listen, you are not to blow the dam until I give the signal. If the reservoir isn't full, the Fire Nation troops could survive. [The Duke jumps off the wagon.] \n",
      "THE.DUKE: But what about the people in the town, won't they get wiped out too? [Jet places a hand on The Duke's shoulder.] \n",
      "JET: Look Duke, that's the price of ridding this area of the Fire Nation. [To Longshot.] Now don't blow the dam until I give the signal—got it? [Longshot nods.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka watches incredulously from the bushes. He frowns, and hears rustling just before Pipsqueak drags him out by his wolf-tail. Smellerbee's knife is instantly at his throat. \n",
      "SMELLERBEE: [Sneering.] Where do you think you're going, ponytail? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Jet, standing near the edge of the cliff. As he watches, Pipsqueak and Smellerbee drag Sokka between them. Pipsqueak still has a handful of Sokka's wolf-tail. \n",
      "JET: Sokka, I'm glad you decided to join us. [Pipsqueak and Smellerbee send Sokka to his knees. He rubs his shoulder.] \n",
      "SOKKA: I heard your plan to destroy the Earth Kingdom town. \n",
      "JET: Our plan is to rid the valley of the Fire Nation. \n",
      "SOKKA: There are people living there, Jet; mothers and fathers and children. \n",
      "JET: We can't win without making some sacrifices. [Sokka points an accusing finger at Jet.] \n",
      "SOKKA: You lied to Aang and Katara about the forest fire! \n",
      "JET: Because they don't understand the demands of war. Not like you and I do. \n",
      "SOKKA: I do understand. I understand that there's nothing you won't do to get what you want. \n",
      "JET: I was hoping you'd have an open mind, but I can see you've made your choice. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Pipsqueak and Smellerbee grab for Sokka. Before he can even react, Jet has his wrist pinned with the hooks of his shuang gou. Sokka's other hand is forced behind his back. \n",
      "JET: I can't let you warn Katara and Aang. [Jet releases Sokka's hand; it is immediately forced behind his back.] Take him for a walk, a long walk. \n",
      "SOKKA: You can't do this! \n",
      "JET: Cheer up, Sokka. We're gonna win a great victory against the Fire Nation today. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The screen pans to the riverside upriver from the dam. The collected water behind it is much less than the larger cavity of the reservoir. The river leading to down to it is a thread compared to its 'rainy season' gully. Jet, Katara, and Aang are seen walking upriver along its west bank. \n",
      "KATARA: Jet, I'm sorry about how Sokka's been acting. \n",
      "JET: No worries, he already apologized. \n",
      "AANG: Really? [Aang and Katara stop and look at one another.] Sokka apologized? \n",
      "JET: Yeah, I was surprised too. I got the sense that maybe you talked to him or something. \n",
      "KATARA: Yeah, I did. \n",
      "JET: I guess something you said got through to him. Anyhow, he went out on a scouting mission with Pipsqueak and Smellerbee. \n",
      "KATARA: I'm glad he cooled off. He's so stubborn sometimes. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They are now walking in the gully, beside the 'river'. Aang pauses after noticing something strange, and is launched into the air by a blast from the geyser he was standing on. \n",
      "JET: All right, we're here. Underground water's trying to escape through these vents. I need you guys to help it along. \n",
      "KATARA: I've never used bending on water I can't see. I don't know ... [Jet stands behind her and places his hands on her shoulders.] \n",
      "JET: Katara. You can do this. \n",
      "AANG: [Airbends himself back on the ground.] What about me? \n",
      "JET: I know the Avatar can do this. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang and Katara stand on one of the many geysers in the gully. While Jet looks on, they bend the water up. After a few minutes, a stream of water emerges from the hole. They pull it to their height and send it toward the river where it continues to flow like a waterfall. The water quickly joins the river. \n",
      "JET: Yes! Good job! This river empties into the reservoir--a few more geysers and it'll be full. \n",
      "AANG: Look, there's another steam vent. [Aang and Katara walk off in its direction.] \n",
      "JET: Okay. You two keep it up, I'll go check on things at the reservoir. [He turns and walks away.] \n",
      "KATARA: When we're done we'll meet you over there. \n",
      "JET: Actually ... probably better if you meet me back at the hideout when you're done. [Jet resumes walking away Aang and Katara bend the next geyser into another fountain.] \n",
      "AANG: [Later.] I bet that's enough, and I'm not just saying that to be lazy. [Around them, over a dozen geysers flow into the river.] \n",
      "KATARA: Let's catch up with Jet at the reservoir. \n",
      "AANG: I thought we agreed to meet Jet back at the hideout. \n",
      "KATARA: Well, we finished early. I'm sure he'll be happy to see us. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The screen changes to a path in the forest. Pipsqueak and Smellerbee follow Sokka, who has his hands tied behind his back. Smellerbee gives Sokka a shove; Sokka stumbles but remains on his feet. \n",
      "SMELLERBEE: Come on, move along! \n",
      "SOKKA: How can you stand by and do nothing while Jet wipes out a whole town? \n",
      "PIPSQUEAK: Hey listen Sokka, Jet's a great leader. We follow what he says, and things always turn out okay. [Sokka notices a couple of snare leaf-piles nearby identical to the one that enticed Momo, right down to the pile of nuts.] \n",
      "SOKKA: If that's how Jet leads, then he's got a lot to learn. [Sokka sprints off in the direction of the snares. Smellerbee makes a grab for him, but misses.] \n",
      "SMELLERBEE: Hey! [They give chase. Sokka leaps over the leaf piles. Pipsqueak and Smellerbee don't, and end up snared and hanging many feet up in the air.] \n",
      "SOKKA: While you two are up there, you might want to practice your knot work. [He holds up his now-worthless bindings, turns, and walks away.] \n",
      "PIPSQUEAK: Hey Smellerbee, you gonna eat your lychee nuts? [Smellerbee hits him in the head with a lychee nut and it lands in the pile he's holding.] Ooh. [He picks one up and licks his lips.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara and Aang are standing on the edge of the cliff. At the base of the dam, four of Jet's people are unloading barrels from the wagon and arranging them. \n",
      "KATARA: What are they doing? \n",
      "AANG: Hey, those are the red barrels he got from the Fire Nation. \n",
      "KATARA: Why would they need blasting jelly? [Zooms on Aang, who is horrified.] \n",
      "AANG: Because Jet's gonna blow up the dam. \n",
      "KATARA: What? No, that would destroy the town. Jet wouldn't do that. [Aang opens his glider.] \n",
      "AANG: I've gotta stop him. [He takes off.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Less convinced.] Jet wouldn't do that. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Before Aang can reach the edge, Jet crosses his path from behind and snatches the glider. Aang is left wobbling precariously on the edge, and uses airbending to get himself back on stable footing. \n",
      "JET: Yes I would. \n",
      "KATARA: Jet, why? \n",
      "JET: Katara, you would too if you just stopped to think. Think about what the Fire Nation did to your mother, we can't let them do that to anyone else, ever again. \n",
      "KATARA: This isn't the answer! \n",
      "JET: I want you to understand me Katara. I thought your brother would understand, but— \n",
      "KATARA: Where's Sokka? [Tears fall from her eyes. Jet reaches out and touches her face.] \n",
      "JET: Katara. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She lowers her head, and with a shout, sends Jet flying with the water from her waterskin. She draws it back into the skin when she's done. \n",
      "AANG: I need to get to the dam. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang's closed glider is on the ground. As he reaches for it, one of Jet's hook swords pins it. Jet has the two swords hook to hook; with a yank he pulls Aang's glider to him. \n",
      "JET: You're not going anywhere without your glider. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Jet swings the swords at Aang. Aang somersaults backward to avoid the extra reach. Aang finishes his retreat in a nearby tree. \n",
      "AANG: I'm not gonna fight you, Jet. \n",
      "JET: [Taunting.] You'll have to if you want your glider back. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang retreats back into the forest, as Jet hooks the branch and pulls himself up. Katara follows on the ground. Jet attacks; Aang defends himself with balls of air, which Jet ducks. Jet attacks head on, but Aang blocks with his arms and sends his opponent flying into a tree trunk with an air kick. Jet combines his swords again and advances. Aang avoids the flail-like move and sends another air blast. Jet stoops down and lets the air flow over and past him before lunging. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They continue the chase through the many levels of the forest. Jet catches up to Aang and sends them both freefalling, attacking as they go. They both end up on a branch. Jet continues his attack. Aang avoids it all. Jet charges again, but Aang hits him with a jetstream of air. Jet falls. He recovers, but loses the glider in the process. Before Aang can get to the ground Jet kicks him into a trunk. He lands with a thud next to his glider. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A small tributary flows past him. Aang is slow to get up. Before Jet can take more than a step however, he his hit by a large water strike. Katara is there; she uses water from the river to throw Jet against the trunk of the tree. Over and over she attacks; Jet is unable to cut the water and its force plasters him against the trunk. She freezes Jet from toe to neck. \n",
      "KATARA: Why, Jet? I can't believe I trusted you. You lied to me, you're sick and I trusted you! [A birdcall is heard. Katara and Aang are startled, and look to the valley beyond where it's coming from. Jet gives an answering birdcall.] What are you doing? \n",
      "JET: You're too late. \n",
      "KATARA: [Horrified.] No! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang opens his glider and runs for the nearby cliff. His glider's wings are damaged to the point that he has no lift, and slams back into the ground near the edge. Katara runs over to help him. \n",
      "AANG: [In pain from the fall.] Sokka's still out there, he's our only chance. \n",
      "KATARA: Come on, Sokka. I'm sorry I ever doubted you, please. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Longshot stands on a branch, his bow pulled. He has a flaming arrow on the string. He takes aim and fires. It arcs down to the base of the dam. Katara watches in horror. \n",
      "KATARA: [Whispers.] No ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The center of the dam explodes in a cloud of smoke and fire. Katara and Aang watch a massive wall of water go to the town. Inside the town the streets are empty except for the occasional barrels and the Cabbage Merchant's cabbage cart. The water rushes through the open gate, as a cresting wave dwarfs it. The wall and gate are swallowed as the wave strikes the town. The flotsam carried away includes a smiling doll in a purple dress. \n",
      "AANG: Sokka didn't make it in time. \n",
      "KATARA: All those people ... [She turns in rage back to Jet.] Jet, you monster! \n",
      "JET: This was a victory, Katara. Remember that. The Fire Nation is gone and this valley will be safe. \n",
      "SOKKA: It will be safe, without you. [In shock, Jet looks up to see Sokka, Appa, and Momo rise from below the level of the cliff.] \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka! \n",
      "SOKKA: I warned the villagers of your plan, just in time. \n",
      "JET: What?! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Cuts to an illustrated set of flashback stills each being panned through.] At first they didn't believe me. The Fire Nation soldiers assumed I was a spy. But one man vouched for me, the old man you attacked. He urged them to trust me, and we got everyone out in time. [The flashback ends and the townsfolk are seen on high ground above the river, on the bank opposite the town. A little girl, who was seen in the flashback, runs down to the water's edge as the doll floats by. She retrieves it.] \n",
      "LITTLE.GIRL: [Happily.] Misses Pretty! [She hugs her doll.] \n",
      "JET: Sokka, you fool! We could've freed this valley! \n",
      "SOKKA: Who would be free? Everyone would be dead. \n",
      "JET: You traitor! \n",
      "SOKKA: No, Jet. You became the traitor when you stopped protecting innocent people. \n",
      "JET: Katara. Please, help me. \n",
      "KATARA: Goodbye Jet. [Sokka gives Appa's reigns a flick.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Yip yip. [Jet is left behind, still frozen to the tree.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The sky they fly in is empty, save a few wispy clouds. \n",
      "AANG: We thought you were going to the dam. How come you went to the town instead? \n",
      "KATARA: Let me guess, your instincts told you. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Shrugs his right shoulder.] Hey, sometimes they're right. \n",
      "AANG:: Um ... Sokka? You know we're going the wrong way, right? [Sokka is surprised, but quickly recovers.] \n",
      "SOKKA: And sometimes they're wrong. [With a grin, he pulls Appa's reigns. They fly off screen before reappearing, going in the opposite direction.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fades to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Opening shot of the sun setting behind some tall rock outcroppings. The sky is mostly cloudy and the clouds reflect the light of the dying sun. Pan down to show a patched up tent being jostled about from the inside. A rolled up tarp lies next to the tent. Sokka is inside a tent, trying to assemble it. Sokka can be heard grunting and fussing about as he tries to finish setting up the shelter. Katara walks in the frame, her back to the camera, with a pile of fire wood in her arms. \n",
      "KATARA: Um, aren't you forgetting the tarp? \n",
      "SOKKA: Right, got it ... [Tosses the wrapped up tarp inside the tent.] \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka, you're supposed to put the tarp on top of the tent. You know, so we don't get rained on? [Cut to an overhead shot of the two, Sokka gesturing widely as he replies to his sister.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Ordinarily, you'd be right, but seeing how it's the dry season, you're not. Besides that tarp makes a pretty warm blanket. \n",
      "KATARA: But what if it does rain? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Spreading his arms wide in exasperation.] What if it doesn't? Then I would have put up the tarp for nothing. \n",
      "KATARA: You're infuriating! \n",
      "SOKKA: Katara, why don't you worry about gathering firewood, because that kindling is looking pretty sorry. \n",
      "KATARA: [Angrily.] Well, if you don't like my firewood- [Throws the sticks at Sokka who shields himself from the wood. He stands in anger after the hail of sticks subsides.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Angrily.] Fine by me, if you're not gonna do your job- [He tears the tent down and the two stare at each other angrily as Aang approaches.] \n",
      "AANG: Okay, I got the grub if you guys got the- [The siblings turn away from each other in anger with their arms folded.] hey, where's the campfire? And what happened to the tent? \n",
      "SOKKA: Why don't you ask Miss Know-It-All, Queen of the Twigs. \n",
      "KATARA: Oh yeah? Well, you're Mister Lazy Bum, King of the [Picks up and throws a twig at Sokka's head.] Tents! [Sokka turns around, looking angrily at her.] \n",
      "AANG: [Laughs.] Okay, listen guys, harsh words won't solve problems, action will. Why don't you just switch jobs? \n",
      "KATARA: Sounds good. \n",
      "SOKKA: [At the same time.] Whatever. \n",
      "AANG: [Grinning while gloating.] You see that? Settling feuds and making peace, all in a day's work for the Avatar. [Turns his head to see Momo and Appa fighting over a watermelon. Momo continuously tries to fly away with it, while Appa pins it down. Aang takes the melon and uses airbending to slice it. Momo seems to be complaining about how he got the much smaller half and Appa got the bigger half.] Come on, Momo, that's fair. Appa's got five stomachs. [Appa eats his half of the melon.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene fades to show the group standing on the edge of a huge canyon. \n",
      "AANG: There it is, guys, The Great Divide. \n",
      "KATARA: [In awe.] Wow, I could just stare at it forever. [Zoom backward to show Sokka in the foreground.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Okay, I've seen enough. \n",
      "KATARA: How can you not be fascinated Sokka? This is the largest canyon in the entire world. \n",
      "SOKKA: Then I'm sure we'll be able to see it very clearly from the air while we fly away. \n",
      "GAN.JIN.TRIBESMAN: [Shoving past Sokka.] If you're looking for the canyon guide, I was here first! \n",
      "KATARA: Ooh, canyon guide? Sounds informative. \n",
      "GAN.JIN.TRIBESMAN: Believe me, he's more than a tour guide, he's an earthbender, [Oblivious to the fact that Sokka is behind him, mocking him.] and the only way in and out of the canyon is with his help, and he's taking my tribe across next. \n",
      "SOKKA: Calm down, we know you're next. \n",
      "GAN.JIN.TRIBESMAN: You wouldn't be so calm if the Fire Nation destroyed your home and forced you to flee! My whole tribe has to walk thousands of miles to the capital city of Ba Sing Se. \n",
      "KATARA: You're a refugee! \n",
      "GAN.JIN.TRIBESMAN: Huh, tell me something I don't know. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A large group of poorly dressed people is shown walking toward them. \n",
      "KATARA: Is that your tribe? \n",
      "GAN.JIN.TRIBESMAN: It most certainly is not! That's the Zhang tribe, a bunch of low-life thieves. They've been the enemies of my tribe for a hundred years. [Whistles to them.] Hey, Zhangs! I'm saving a spot for my tribe so don't even think about stealing it! \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: Where are the rest of the Gan Jin? Still tidying up their camp site? \n",
      "GAN.JIN.TRIBESMAN: Yes, but they sent me ahead of them to hold a spot. \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: I didn't know the canyon guide took reservations. \n",
      "GAN.JIN.TRIBESMAN: Ha, of course you didn't! That's the ignorance I'd expect from a messy Zhang. So unorganized and ill-prepared for a journey. [The Zhang tribe members yell out in protest behind them. Katara and Aang look at each other worriedly, but turn around to see a large pile of rocks being levitated up and thrown away. The canyon guide stands behind where the rocks used to be.] \n",
      "CANYON.GUIDE: Sorry about the wait, youngsters. Who's ready to cross this here canyon? \n",
      "KATARA: Uh, one of them, I think. [Camera pans left to reveal the Zhang and the scout.] \n",
      "GAN.JIN.TRIBESMAN: [Rushing forward.] I was here first, my party's on their way. \n",
      "CANYON.GUIDE: I can't guide people who aren't here. [Cut to a wider shot showing the Zhang filing past the three kids and the fuming Gan Jin scout.] \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: [Mockingly.] Guess you guys will have to make the trip tomorrow. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The shot shifts to a close-up the scout, whose eyes twitch in anger. The camera zooms backward and pans left to reveal another tribe entering the canyon entrance area. The scout points to them in triumph. \n",
      "GAN.JIN.TRIBESMAN: Wait, here they come! [A group of clean, finely dressed people are shown coming toward them.] \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: [To the canyon guide.] You're not seriously gonna cave into these spoiled Gan Jins? I mean we're refugees too! And we've got sick people that need shelter. \n",
      "CANYON.GUIDE: I ... uh ... well ... \n",
      "GAN.JIN.TRIBESMAN: We've got old people who are weary from traveling. \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: Sick people get priority over old people. \n",
      "GAN.JIN.LEADER: Maybe you Zhangs wouldn't have so many sick people if you weren't such slobs. \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: If you Gan Jins weren't so clean, you wouldn't live to be so old. \n",
      "KATARA: [Over the two arguing tribes.] Well Aang, ready to put your peace-making skills to the test? \n",
      "AANG: I don't know, a fight over chores is one thing, but these people have been feuding for a hundred years. \n",
      "KATARA: [Stepping forward.] Everybody listen up! This is the Avatar, and if you give him a chance, I'm sure he can come up with a compromise that will make everyone happy. \n",
      "AANG: Uh, you could share the earthbender and travel together? \n",
      "GAN.JIN.LEADER: Absolutely not! We'd rather be taken by the Fire Nation than travel with those stinking thieves! \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: We wouldn't travel with those pompous fools anyway! [The two tribes begin to shout at each other again.] \n",
      "AANG: [Shouting.] All right here's the deal, you're all going down together and Appa here will fly your sick and elderly across! Does that seem fair? [Both leaders nod in agreement, and the scene fades to show the sick and elderly boarding Appa.] \n",
      "AANG: [To Appa.] Sorry, Appa, you'll have to do this on your own. \n",
      "SOKKA: Aang, this feuding tribe stuff is serious business. Are you sure it's a good idea getting involved in this? \n",
      "AANG: [Grinning broadly.] To tell you the truth, I'm not sure. But when have I ever been? \n",
      "KATARA: He's the Avatar, Sokka, making peace between people is his job. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Dismayed.] His job's gonna make us cross this whole canyon on foot isn't it? [Cut to an overhead wide shot of the two tribes and the others.] \n",
      "CANYON.GUIDE: Okay, now comes the bad news. [Cut to a frontal shot of the guide.] No food allowed in the canyon, it attracts [He makes motions with his hands to illustrate the skittery monsters that might lurk in the canyon.] dangerous predators. [Both tribes yell out in protest.] \n",
      "GAN.JIN.LEADER: No food?! This is ridiculous. \n",
      "CANYON.GUIDE: Oh, you babies can go a day without food? Would you rather be hungry, or dead? [He raises an earth pillar to tower over the rest. He continues, cupping his hands to his mouth to amplify his voice.] Now, we're heading down in ten minutes. All food better be in your gut or in the garbage! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Zhang tribe quickly whips out and shoves food into their mouths, which stands in stark contrast to the Gan Jin tribe, who eat slowly with chopsticks. \n",
      "AANG: [To the people on Appa.] Appa's going to take good care of you 'till we get there. [To Appa.] See you on the other side, buddy! Yip yip! [Appa roars and takes off. The camera fades to show both groups of people climbing down into the canyon. The tour guide earthbends to form a bridge in a gap in the path.] \n",
      "AANG: Nice bending! \n",
      "CANYON.GUIDE: The job's much more than bending, kid. Folks want information. [Turns to the travelers.] Many of you are probably wondering how canyons are formed. Experts tell us this canyon was most likely carved into the ground by earth spirits who were angry at local farmers for not offering them a proper sacrifice. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara and Sokka look up in fear as an avalanche of rocks comes falling toward them, and the canyon guide earthbends it away from them. \n",
      "CANYON.GUIDE: He he he, guess the spirits are still angry! Hope you all brought sacrifices. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a wide shot of the canyon floor and the canyon wall on the right side of the screen. The view pans slowly rightward before cutting to a closer, overhead shot of the group now at the bottom of the switchback trail. They have just entered the canyon floor. The guide stands in front of the two tribes and the kids. Katara, Aang, and Sokka look at each other in exasperation and the scene fades to show them standing at the bottom of the canyon next to a huge boulder. \n",
      "CANYON.GUIDE: Okay, everyone stand clear of the wall. [He throws the boulder and destroys the bridge he had made earlier.] \n",
      "AANG: Why'd you do that? \n",
      "CANYON.GUIDE: These people are fleeing the Fire Nation, aren't they? Gotta make sure we can't be followed. We'll be safe now. [Yells out, as he is picked up by a huge animal. Aang blows away the dust to reveal a canyon crawler.] \n",
      "SOKKA: We gotta help him! [He throws his boomerang at the crawler, which drops the canyon guide and comes after Sokka instead.] Okay, now we gotta help me! [Katara comes to his aid and does a water whip on the crawler, but she is quickly thrown aside. Aang jumps down and sends a multiple blasts of air at the crawler and drives it away.] \n",
      "AANG: [To the canyon guide.] What was that? \n",
      "CANYON.GUIDE: [On the ground.] Canyon crawler. [Groans in pain.] And there's sure to be more! \n",
      "KATARA: Your arms, they're broken! \n",
      "CANYON.GUIDE: Without my arms, I got no bending. In other words- \n",
      "AANG: We're trapped in this canyon. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera fades to show them grouped together. \n",
      "SOKKA: I thought the whole point of ditching our food was so we wouldn't have to deal with things like canyon crawlers. \n",
      "GAN.JIN.LEADER: It's the Zhangs! They took food down here even after the canyon guide told them not to. \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: What? If there's anyone who can't go without food for a day, it's you pampered Gan Jins! \n",
      "GAN.JIN.LEADER: I hope you're happy. We're stuck in this canyon with no way out. \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: Why don't you thank yourself, food hider? \n",
      "AANG: Look, sticking together is the only way to- \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: I'm not walking another step with the likes of them! \n",
      "GAN.JIN.LEADER: Now there's something we can agree on. \n",
      "AANG: [To the canyon guide.] Any ideas? \n",
      "CANYON.GUIDE: No bendng ... we need to get out of this canyon ... I won't die down here! I won't become part of the food chain! \n",
      "GAN.JIN.LEADER: See! We're going to become part of the food chain because of you! [Points to Zhangs.] \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: Sure, unjustly blame the Zhangs like you always do! \n",
      "GAN.JIN.LEADER: Gladly. \n",
      "AANG: [Angrily.] Enough! I thought I could help you guys get along, but I guess that's not gonna happen. [Jumps onto a tall rock.] We should split up, Gan Jins on this side and Zhangs on that side. We'll travel in two separate lines. [The two leaders nod at each other and start walking. Aang jumps down to Sokka and Katara.] Sokka, you go with the Zhangs and Katara, you go with the Gan Jins. See if you can find out why they hate each other so much. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They split up and the camera pans to show them walking separately. The scene changes to show Sokka in the Zhang camp. \n",
      "SOKKA: So, you guys aren't going to put up your tarps? \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: What for? Its the dry season. \n",
      "SOKKA: Exactly! \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: Besides, we like to use the tarp as a blanket. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Smiling.] Finally, someone gets it! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara is shown at the Gan Jin camp, where they are putting up tarps over their tents. \n",
      "KATARA: You really think it'll rain? \n",
      "GAN.JIN.LEADER: No, but you can never be too careful, right? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara smiles and the camera fades to nightfall, where they are sitting around their campfire. The Gan Jin leader looks around and pulls a piece of bread out of his sleeve. Katara looks stunned to see all the other tribe members doing the same. \n",
      "GAN.JIN.LEADER: Would you care for some bread, Katara? \n",
      "KATARA: So it was you guys who had food! \n",
      "GAN.JIN.LEADER: Oh come now, you really think that tribe of thieves isn't smuggling food? Why should my people go hungry when the sneaky Zhangs are stuffing their faces? \n",
      "KATARA: [Hesitates.] Well, I guess it's okay if everyone's doing it. [Takes the bread and eats it.] So, why does your tribe hate the Zhangs so much? \n",
      "GAN.JIN.LEADER: You seem like a smart girl Katara, I bet you would enjoy hearing some history. [Fades to show a large gate with a finely dressed man running toward it. Voice-over.] The patriarch of our tribe, Jin Wei, was an earthbender warrior who was assigned an important duty, transporting our sacred orb from the great eastern gate, to the great western gate. Taking the orb from the east to the west represents the sun's rising and setting. It was our tribe's ancient redemption ritual. But as he approached the gate, Jin Wei was attacked by one of the Zhang, a vermin named Wei Jin, who looked at the orb with envy. That coward Wei Jin knocked Jin Wei to the ground, and stole our sacred orb. [Camera goes back to the Gan Jin leader's face.] Our people have never forgotten. You can never trust a Zhang. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara glares at the Zhang's camp and the scene fades to show the Zhang tribe and Sokka sitting around the campfire. \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: [To Sokka.] Care for some meat? \n",
      "SOKKA: Would I! [Takes the meat and bites down hungrily.] \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: I know what you must be thinking, we're horrible for endangering everybody by bringing food down here. \n",
      "SOKKA: Hm-hmm. \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: The Gan Jin think so badly of us, they probably assumed we brought food in and decided to bring food in themselves. That's why we brought food in. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Still eating.] Hmm. \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: Our conflict with the Gan Jin goes back over a hundred years. [Fades to show a poorly-dressed man running through a large gate. Voice-over.] Our forefather Wei Jin was leaving the western gate of our village, when he saw a figure in the distance. It was a man of the Gan Jin tribe, Jin Wei, collapsed on the ground. Noble Wei Jin stopped to help him. Jin Wei was transporting a sacred orb, a very powerful relic used in his tribe's redemption ritual. Wei Jin tried to tend to the man's wounds but Jin Wei insisted the orb was more important, and asked him to take it back to his tribe. Kind Wei Jin promised to send help for the man as soon as he could, but as Wei Jin crossed the border to return the orb into Gan Jin territory, he was arrested. Instead of thanking him for his kind and selfless deed, they sentenced him to twenty long years in prison. [Back to Zhang leader.] We Zhangs will never forget that injustice. \n",
      "SOKKA: That's just terrible. [Looks at her piece of meat.] You gonna finish that? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fades to show Aang sitting with Momo far from both camps. \n",
      "AANG: Sure would be nice to be sitting around one of those campfires, telling stories and laughing. Its okay Momo, we'll be out of here soon enough, and then we can eat our weight in leechi nuts! [Momo jumps up and snatches a bug out of the air, he eats part of it before offering the rest to Aang.] Nah, I'll wait for the leechi nuts. \n",
      "CANYON.GUIDE: [Slowly approaching Aang.] Lonely isn't it, being impartial? \n",
      "AANG: I wish I could help these people get along, but it just seems impossible. Anyhow, I guess our biggest problem is getting out of here. \n",
      "CANYON.GUIDE: I'm not so sure the two problems are unrelated. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang looks away sadly and the scene fades to show the two tribes traveling again in daylight. \n",
      "CANYON.GUIDE: All clear, we're almost to the other side. \n",
      "AANG: [Jumps down to Katara and Sokka.] Katara, Sokka, will these people cooperate long enough to get out of the canyon? \n",
      "KATARA: I don't think so, Aang, the Zhangs really wronged the Gan Jins. They ambushed Jin Wei and stole the sacred orb. \n",
      "AANG: What are you talking about? \n",
      "SOKKA: Yeah Katara, what are you talking about? Wei Jin didn't steal the orb, he was returning it to their village gate and was wrongfully punished by the Gan Jin. \n",
      "KATARA: Not punished enough if you ask me. \n",
      "AANG: [Over Sokka's frustrated growls.] Okay, okay I get it! Now I need your help, I need everyone together at the base of the canyon wall. [He takes off on his glider and the scene fades to show him landing between the two tribes.] Please everyone, as soon as we get out of here we can eat and then go our separate ways, but I need you all to put your heads together and figure out a way up this cliff. \n",
      "GAN.JIN.LEADER: Maybe the Zhang can climb the wall with their long disgusting fingernails. \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: Oh sorry, I forgot that to the Gan Jin unclipped fingernails is a crime punishable by twenty years in jail! \n",
      "GAN.JIN.LEADER: Why, you dirty thief! \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: You pompous fool! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The tribes began to argue loudly again, accompanied by Katara and Sokka. \n",
      "AANG: [Shouting.] Guys, focus! How many times do I have to say it? Harsh words won't solve problems, action will! \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: Perhaps the Avatar is right. \n",
      "GAN.JIN.LEADER: Yes, perhaps he is. [Aang grins happily at this.] \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: Harsh words will never solve our problems. \n",
      "GAN.JIN.LEADER: Action will! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They both draw their swords and Aang yells in surprise, as they clash their swords. \n",
      "GAN.JIN.LEADER: To the death! And let this be the end of this rivalry! \n",
      "AANG: You know, I take it back. Harsh words aren't so bad! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two leaders ignore him as they begin to fight. They are evenly matched, and continue until Aang blows them apart with a strong gust of air. The two tribes go flying backward, revealing a large amount of hidden food. \n",
      "AANG: [Shocked.] Is that ... food? Everyone smuggled food down here? Unbelievable! You guys put our lives in danger because you couldn't go without a snack for a day? You're all awful! [He looks in wonder at a custard tart, and his stomach growls.] So hungry. Is that an egg custard in that tart? [He turns to see dozens of canyon crawlers approaching, and they all try to flee.] \n",
      "KATARA: Oh no, that's a lot of canyon crawlers. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Taking out his boomerang.] We barely survived one! \n",
      "CANYON.GUIDE: They're coming back for me! They've had a taste and they're coming back for me! \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka, wait. [Stops him as he runs forward.] I don't care about this stupid feud, I just want us to get out of here alive. \n",
      "SOKKA: Me too. I only took their side 'cause they fed me. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera cuts to show Aang fighting off the canyon crawlers, and soon has them all in a pile. The crawlers pick themselves up and target the refugees. Though Aang, Katara, Sokka, and the tribe leaders fight hard to hold them off, they are vastly out numbered. Aang looks around to see the crawlers eating the food out of the bags. \n",
      "AANG: [Shouting.] Everybody, watch me and do what I do! [He distracts a crawler with a piece of food, leaps on its back, and throws a bag over its snout. The two tribes mimic him, working together.] Now follow me! We're riding out of this hole! [Aang ties a huge bag of food onto a stick and uses it to guide the crawlers up the canyon wall.] Everyone, get off! \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: [Jumping off a crawler.] We made it! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As soon as all the people have made it up the cliff, Aang throws the bag back down, and the crawlers follow. \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: I never thought a Gan Jin could get his hands dirty like that. \n",
      "GAN.JIN.LEADER: And I never knew you Zhangs were so reliable in a pinch. \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: Perhaps we're not so different after all. [They both smile at each other and Aang sighs in relief.] \n",
      "GAN.JIN.LEADER: Too bad we can't rewrite history. You thieves stole our sacred orb from Jin Wei! [Draws his sword.] \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: [Draws her sword.] You tyrants unjustly imprisoned Wei Jin for twenty long years! \n",
      "AANG: [Sighs in frustration.] Wait a second ... Jin Wei? Wei Jin? I know those guys! \n",
      "GAN.JIN.LEADER: Yes, yes, we're all aware of the story. \n",
      "AANG: No, I mean I really knew them. I might not look it, but I'm a hundred and twelve years old. I was there one hundred years ago on the day you're talking about. [Scene fades to show the two men facing each other. Voice-over.] There seems to be a lot of confusion about what happened. First of all, Jin Wei and Wei Jin weren't enemies. They were brothers, twins in fact, and they were eight; and most importantly, they were just playing a game! The sacred orb from the legend, that was the ball! And the eastern and western gates were the goal posts. Jin Wei had the ball and was running toward the goal when he fell and fumbled it. Wei Jin didn't steal the ball, he picked it up and started running it toward the other goal, but he stepped out of bounds, so the official put him in the penalty box. Not for twenty long years but for two short minutes. [Fades back to Aang.] There was no stealing and no putting anyone in imprison, it was just a game. \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: You're saying the sacred orb was actually a sacred ball? \n",
      "AANG: Nope, just a regular ball. \n",
      "GAN.JIN.MAN: What about our tribe's redemption ritual? \n",
      "AANG: That's what the game was called, redemption. As soon as you got the ball from one end to the other, everyone would yell \"redemption\"! [The tribe leaders look at each other skeptically.] Don't get me wrong, Wei Jin was kind of a slob and Jin Wei was a little stuffy, that much is true. But they respected each other's differences enough to share the same playing field. \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: [To the Gan Jin leader.] I suppose it's time we forget the past. \n",
      "GAN.JIN.LEADER: [Bowing.] And look to the future. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Zhang leader bows back and Aang looks at them happily. The scene fades to show them standing with Appa. \n",
      "AANG: Good to see you, boy. Did you miss me? [Appa licks Aang as the Gan Jin leader approaches.] \n",
      "GAN.JIN.LEADER: I cannot thank you enough, Avatar. \n",
      "AANG: [Covered in Appa's slobber.] Well, you know I try. \n",
      "GAN.JIN.LEADER: [Recoils in disgust.] Ugh! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fades to show the two tribes standing together. \n",
      "ZHANG.LEADER: Let us travel to the Earth Kingdom capital as one tribe. [Both tribes cheer as they start walking.] \n",
      "CANYON.GUIDE: [Running forward.] I'm going too! I'm sick of this place! \n",
      "SOKKA: That's some luck you knew Jin Wei and Wei Jin. \n",
      "AANG: You could call it luck. Or you could call it lying. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Flabbergasted.] What? \n",
      "AANG: I made the whole thing up. \n",
      "KATARA: [Shocked.] You did not! [In devilish admiration.] That is so wrong. \n",
      "AANG: Now where is that custard tart? I'm starving! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fades to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode begins in Aang's dream. The scene itself, dominated by a tinge of warm yellow, is filled with clouds for a moment before Aang slides into the frame of the shot, his face happy as he flicks the reins. The shot switches to a far view, showing that he is riding Appa, who is flapping his six legs in unison up and down as if he were a bird. The camera pans to the right, revealing Sokka as he pulls alongside Appa, using Aang's glider to fly with the Avatar. The shot cuts to a close-up of the Water Tribe warrior as he turns his head toward Aang, grinning broadly and contentedly at him. Cut to Aang as his face exhibits the same contented grin. He turns his attention to his right and the camera follows his gaze, revealing Katara sitting atop the head of an enormous Momo; she waves at Aang. Camera moves back to a wide frontal shot of the group coursing leisurely through the open sky. \n",
      "KATARA: [Voice-over.] We need you, Aang. \n",
      "AANG: [Close-up as he is looking toward Katara; contentedly.] I need you, too. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang notices something out of the corner of his eyes. As he turns toward it, his expression changes to shock. Focusing on Aang's face, the camera turns 180 degrees and switches to his point of view as the sky's coloring changes to a dark, ominous gray, revealing a churning storm cloud before him. Cut back to Aang, who yanks Appa's reins in fright. \n",
      "AANG: [Alarmed.] Be careful, guys! [He looks to his left and right, uneasy.] Guys? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene rapidly zooms out, revealing that Aang and Appa are alone, surrounded by nothing but the darkening sky. Cut back to Aang's point of view as Gyatso, in lotus, floats downward, positioning himself in front of Aang. \n",
      "AANG: [Surprised.] Gyatso? \n",
      "GYATSO: [Whispering, his tone sad.] Why did you disappear? \n",
      "AANG: [Frontal shot; his voice soft and sad.] I didn't mean to. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a side-view of the two monks, not a meter apart from one another. Aang reaches out to Gyatso, but before he can touch him, Gyatso turns gray and dissipates into smoke; it blows over Aang, causing him to raise his left arm in front of his face and turn away to shield himself from it. Frontal shot of Aang as the last of the smoke washes over him. He peeks over his arm, but instantly raises his head, his eyes growing big in shock; a dark shadow passes over him as the shot cuts to a distant side-view of Appa being swallowed by the dark cloud. \n",
      "GYATSO: [Voice-over.] We need you, Aang. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A bolt of lightning splits the shot for an instant before cutting to a frontal shot of a screaming and frightened Aang, wrestling with the reins, as he and Appa are caught in the belly of the storm with rain beating down on them. Cut to an underwater shot as Aang and Appa plummet into the ocean. The duo floats for a moment. Cut to a close-up of Aang's hand as his grip on Appa's reins loosens and they slip from his limp grasp. \n",
      "GYATSO.AND.KATARA: [Echoing voice-over.] We need you, Aang. [Cut to a downward view of an unconscious Aang sinking.] We need you. We need you, Aang. We need you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Unmoving, Aang sinks and disappears into the darkness of the ocean. For a fraction of a second, lightning splits the shot once again and the silhouette of the Fire Lord surrounded by flames appears.\n",
      "The scene cuts to reality as Aang, gasping for air and shooting upright, startles Momo, who was curled up on top of Aang. Momo leaps onto Katara's stomach, causing her to shoot up with a startled look on her face, before jumping on Sokka's, who shoots up, still sleepy, halfheartedly wielding his dagger and boomerang. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Drowsily.] What's going on? [He looks around.] Did we get captured again? \n",
      "AANG: [Shot looking down, sliding right; Aang turns to his friends.] It's nothing. I just had a bad dream. [He curls up, facing away from them.] Go back to sleep. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Curls up, facing away from Aang.] Don't have to tell me twice. \n",
      "KATARA: [Frontal shot of Aang with Katara behind him, looking at him in concern.] Are you all right, Aang? \n",
      "AANG: [Looking lost.] I'm okay. \n",
      "KATARA: You seem to be having a lot of nightmares lately. You want to tell me about it? \n",
      "AANG: [Briefly closing his eyes.] I think I just need some rest. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sitting up behind Katara; upbeat.] You guys want to hear about my dream? [Katara glares at him, an expression Sokka returns.] That's okay. I didn't want to talk about it anyway. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka lies down, disappearing from view; Katara does the same.\n",
      "Scene changes to waves crashing on a sandy shore under a blue sky. Cut to a wide frontal shot of Katara as she carries their packs toward Appa, who yawns. As the animal closes its mouth again, Aang is revealed sitting on his head, while Sokka sits on the saddle. \n",
      "AANG: Look at those clear skies, buddy! [Pets Appa's head. Cut to a close shot as he looks up at a flock of birds arranged in a \"V\" flying overhead, their goose-like honking audible.] Should be some smooth flying. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to an overhead shot looking down of Katara looking into a bag before holding it upside down, sprinkling the ground with crumbs; Momo instantly eats them. Sokka walks past her toward Appa, carrying some of their luggage. \n",
      "KATARA: [Looking from the contents of the bag up to Aang.] Well, we better smoothly fly [She steps onto Appa's tail and walks to the saddle.] ourselves to a market, 'cause we're out of food. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Side-shot as he suddenly straightens up, his tone serious.] Guys, wait. This was in my dream. [Momo lands on the pack behind him.] We shouldn't go to the market. \n",
      "KATARA: [Shot cuts beside Sokka, facing out toward Katara and Aang, who turn to look at him; curious.] What happened in your dream? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Frontal shot; his eyes are bugged out in terror and the camera zooms in on him, rolling slightly as the shot takes on a greenish tint and alien music dubs the scene.] Food eats people! [The colors return to normal as the shot cuts to Katara's face as she shakes her head. Behind her, Aang goes back to adjusting the reins. Cut to Sokka again as he points at Momo.] Also, Momo could talk. [He glares at Momo while crossing his arms.] You said some very unkind things. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo's ears droop as Sokka speaks. Cut to downward looking shot of a flock of birds in V-formation flying over the open ocean. As the scene pans to the left, Zuko's ship sails into view. Cut to the deck, where Iroh stands on the deck, with Zuko looking through a spyglass behind him. As the flight of birds passes over Iroh's head in the distance, he sniffs the air and Zuko lowers the spyglass to turn to his uncle, who speaks. \n",
      "IROH: There is a storm coming. A big one. \n",
      "ZUKO: You're out of your mind, Uncle. [Walking up to Iroh.] The weather's perfect. There's not a cloud in sight. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The shot cuts behind the two, facing the prow of the ship and showing a clear sea and sky. \n",
      "IROH: A storm is approaching from the north. [He turns to face Zuko.] I suggest we alter our course and head southwest. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Taking a few steps in Iroh's direction, pointing briefly northward.] We know the Avatar is traveling northward, so we will do the same. \n",
      "IROH: [Cut to his face; stern.] Prince Zuko, consider the safety of the crew. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Cut to his face as he advances on his uncle angrily.] The safety of the crew doesn't matter! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Behind them, Lieutenant Jee walks onto deck, inadvertently overhearing the conversation. As Zuko realizes Jee is behind him and turns to face him, his expression briefly loses its raging intensity. A quick close-up shows Jee raising an eyebrow as Zuko walks over to him; another cut shifts the view to the lieutenant's side as Zuko, addressing Jee directly, struts up to him, dominantly looking him right in the eyes from a close distance as he finishes speaking. \n",
      "ZUKO: Finding the Avatar is far more important than any individual's safety. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As Zuko walks away, Jee glares after him. The shot switches, showing Zuko leaving the deck through the door at the base of the superstructure. Cut to a frontal shot of Jee, who looks slightly enraged as Iroh walks over to him. \n",
      "IROH: [Reassuringly, a twinge of uncertainty in his voice, almost as if he does not fully believe what he is saying.] He doesn't mean that. He's just all worked up. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to a seaside hamlet built on the side of a cliff face, the roofs all teal-green; a collection of houses sits back from the waterfront, where a row of warehouses adjoins the docks. Among the several ships moored on the town's four piers is Appa, floating in the water by himself. Cut to Katara, who stands in front of a small merchants' stand, suspiciously eying a watermelon. \n",
      "MERCHANT.WOMAN: [Scowling.] Ahhh, it's good. It's perfect, I'm telling you! \n",
      "KATARA: [Shaking the watermelon, which emits an audible sloshing sound.] I don't know if I like the sound of that swishing. \n",
      "MERCHANT.WOMAN: [As the shot zooms out, the merchant moves around the stand where Katara stands. Sokka and Aang, staff in hand, stand beside them; the former is filling a basket with fruit.] Swishing means it's ripe! It's the ripe juices swishing around, eh? \n",
      "AANG: [Taking a step toward Katara.] I think it's true, Katara. Swishing means it's ripe. \n",
      "KATARA: [As the shot cuts to a frontal view of her, she puts the melon back on the stand.] I just realized we're out of money anyway. \n",
      "SHOPKEEPER: [Annoyed, grabbing a basket full of fruits from Sokka.] Awww! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As Sokka walks past the merchant, she indignantly kicks him in the rear, drawing a cry of pain from Sokka. Cut to Sokka, Katara, and Aang on the docks. Sokka is rubbing where the lady kicked him and seems downcast. \n",
      "SOKKA: Out of food and out of money. Now what are we supposed to do? \n",
      "KATARA: You could get a job, smart guy. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A fisherman and his wife are walking behind the gang. As Katara finishes, they begin a loud, heated conversation, which is overheard easily by Aang, Katara, and Sokka. \n",
      "FISHERMAN'S.WIFE: We shouldn't go out there! Please, the fish can wait. There's going to be a terrible storm. [Camera cuts to show Aang, who appears alarmed by the prediction.] \n",
      "FISHERMAN: You're crazy. It's a nice day: [Gesturing to the sky with both arms.] No clouds, no winds, no nothing. So quit your nagging, woman. \n",
      "AANG: [Nervously suggesting to Katara and Sokka.] Maybe we should find some shelter? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Indicating the fair weather.] Are you kidding? Shelter from what? \n",
      "FISHERMAN'S.WIFE: My joints say there's going to be a storm! A bad one. \n",
      "FISHERMAN: Well, it's your joints against my brain. \n",
      "FISHERMAN'S.WIFE: Then I hope your brain can find someone else to haul that fish, 'cause I ain't comin'. \n",
      "FISHERMAN: Then I'll find a new fish hauler and pay him double what you get! [Cut to a side shot of the couple, showing Sokka running up to them.] How do you like that? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Interrupting, raising his hand.] I'll go. \n",
      "FISHERMAN: You're hired! [Shoots a triumphant look at his wife, who scowls back.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [After a short pause, to Katara and Aang.] What? You said get a job ... and he's paying double. \n",
      "FISHERMAN: [Rounding on Sokka, his expression wild.] Double? Who told you that nonsense? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to Zuko's ship on the open ocean. As the shot pans right, a massive bank of darkening clouds, having appeared seemingly out of nowhere, rolls into view, looming in front of the ship. Cut to the deck, where Lieutenant Jee and several other soldiers stand a short distance from the shot, staring at the clouds. Zuko walks into the foreground, regarding the clouds as Jee and the others turn to face him. Iroh walks between Zuko and Jee as the latter taunts the former. \n",
      "LIEUTENANT.JEE: Looks like your uncle was right about the storm after all. \n",
      "IROH: [Pleasantly.] Lucky guess. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Whirling around and walking toward Jee; angry.] Lieutenant! You'd better learn some respect [Jabs two fingers into Jee's chest.] – or I will teach it to you. [Begins to walk away from Jee, who follows Zuko with his eyes, continuing his taunting after a short pause.] \n",
      "JEE: What do you know about respect? [Behind Jee, Iroh's expression turns to panic and he makes a cutting motion at his throat with his hand, trying to signal Lieutenant Jee to stop. Cut to Zuko's back as he stops walking before switching to his face as he listens to Jee's words.] The way you talk to everyone around here, from your hard-working crew to your esteemed uncle, shows you know nothing about respect! [Cut to a close-up of Iroh's face as he gasps slightly, reaching out a hand in desperation before moving it to his forehead in resignation, believing Jee has gone too far. Cut back to Zuko's face, contorted with rage.] You don't care about anyone but yourself! Then again, what should I expect from a spoiled prince? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko turns around and extends his right arm as if preparing to firebend. Lieutenant Jee does the same. \n",
      "IROH: Easy now. [Both Zuko and Jee wrist-block the other's arm; smoke rises from a furious Zuko's hand. Interrupting the staredown, Iroh extends an arm and pulls theirs apart; the smoke fades.] Enough! We're all a bit tired from being at sea so long. I'm sure after a bowl of noodles, everyone will feel much better. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Lieutenant Jee walks away. \n",
      "ZUKO: I don't need your help keeping order on my ship. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Iroh puts a comforting hand on Zuko's right shoulder, but Zuko shrugs it off and walks away. Scene changes back to a dock at the fishing town, where Team Avatar stands. Sokka is carrying supplies onto the fisherman's boat. \n",
      "AANG: Sokka, maybe this isn't such a good idea. Look at the sky. \n",
      "SOKKA: I said I was going to do this job. I can't back out just because of some bad weather. \n",
      "FISHERMAN'S.WIFE: The boy with the tattoos has some sense. You should listen to him! \n",
      "FISHERMAN: Boy with tattoos? [The fisherman turns around to look at Aang.] Airbender tattoos. Well, I'll be a hog monkey's uncle. You're the Avatar, ain't ya? \n",
      "KATARA: That's right. [Katara and Aang smile.] \n",
      "FISHERMAN: Well, don't be so smiley about it. [Katara and Aang frown now.] The Avatar disappeared for a hundred years! You turned your back on the world! \n",
      "KATARA: Don't yell at him! Aang would never turn his back on anyone. \n",
      "FISHERMAN: Oh, he wouldn't, huh? Then I guess I just have imagined the last hundred years of war and suffering. [Aang's eyes widen.] \n",
      "KATARA: Aang is the bravest person I know. He's done nothing but help people and save lives since I met him. [Behind Katara's back, Aang slowly begins to backpedal away from her.] It's not his fault he disappeared, right Aang? [Katara turns around to see Aang backing away.] Aang, what's wrong? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A look of shock and horrified guilt on his face, Aang opens his glider and vaults into the air, rapidly disappearing into the distance. \n",
      "FISHERMAN: That's right! Keep flying! \n",
      "KATARA: You're a horrible old man! [She gets on Appa, who is floating beside the dock.] Appa, yip yip! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As Appa flies out of the water, a big wave splashes the fisherman. Sokka walks out from below deck on the boat. \n",
      "SOKKA: Hey! They left without saying good-bye! \n",
      "FISHERMAN: Your friends ain't too polite, are they? \n",
      "SOKKA: I know! This one time, I was ... \n",
      "FISHERMAN: [Hands Sokka a crate, interrupting him impolitely.] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Get below deck! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to show Katara riding on Appa in the rain, trying to find Aang. The shot cuts to show a cave in the side of a cliff face. Camera changes to a view of Katara outside the cave and Aang sitting alone inside, surrounded by darkness. \n",
      "AANG: [Quietly.] I'm sorry for running away. \n",
      "KATARA: It's okay. That fisherman was way out of line. \n",
      "AANG: Actually, he wasn't. \n",
      "KATARA: [Surprised.] What do you mean? \n",
      "AANG: [Speaks in a sad voice.] I don't want to talk about it. \n",
      "KATARA: It has to do with your dream, doesn't it? [Puts her hand on his shoulder.] Talk to me. \n",
      "AANG: Well, it's kind of a long story. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Suddenly, Momo leaps past Aang and Katara, startling them. Appa has also entered the cave. He nuzzles Aang's head with his nose, making Aang smile. Aang pats Appa's chin. \n",
      "KATARA: I'm going to try to get a little fire going. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Next scene shows Katara and Aang sitting around a fire. Momo is lying on Aang's lap. \n",
      "AANG: I'll never forget the day the monks told me I was the Avatar. I was playing with some other kids just outside the South Wall. I was trying to teach them how to do the air scooter. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to a flashback when Aang is with some other Air Nomads. \n",
      "AANG: First you got to form the ball, then you got to get on quick. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang is seen riding around on the scooter in the court. One of the boys tries it. \n",
      "AIR.NOMAD.BOY.#1: Okay, here goes. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The boy forms it and tries getting on, but spins and falls off. Aang gently gets off his. \n",
      "AANG: You kind of have to balance on it like it's a top. \n",
      "AIR.NOMAD.BOY.#1: Man, that's hard. \n",
      "AIR.NOMAD.BOY.#2: Where'd you learn that trick, Aang? \n",
      "AANG: I made it up. \n",
      "AIR.NOMAD.BOY.#2: Wow! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Council of Elders shows up at that moment. \n",
      "GYATSO: Aang, come with us. We need to speak with you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to when Aang and the elder monks are in the meeting room. \n",
      "AANG: How do you know it's me? \n",
      "TASHI: We have known you were the Avatar for some time. Do you remember these? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Monk Tashi airbends a wrapped-up mat to Aang. It opens up, revealing four toys. \n",
      "AANG: Those were some of my favorite toys when I was little! [He picks up the propeller toy.] \n",
      "TASHI: You chose them from among thousands of toys, Aang. The toys you picked were the four Avatar relics. These items belonged to Avatars past. Your own past lives. \n",
      "AANG: I just chose them because they seemed fun. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He smiles and pulls the cord on the propeller toy, sending the propeller spinning into the air. It spins through the air and the scene cuts back to a close view of the five monks. The toy goes over Monk Tashi's head. \n",
      "TASHI: You chose them because they were familiar. \n",
      "GYATSO: Normally we would have told you of your identity when you turned sixteen, but there are troubling signs. Storm clouds are gathering. \n",
      "PASANG: I fear that war may be upon us, young Avatar. \n",
      "GYATSO: We need you, Aang. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang lowers his head, his responsibility crushing him. His head stays lowered as the flashback ends and his head remains lowered in the present as well. Cut to a wider shot of Aang on the left, Katara on the right, the fire between them. Katara looks upon him with concern and sympathy. The scene changes back to Zuko's ship. Jee is talking about Zuko to a couple other men. \n",
      "JEE: I'm sick of taking his orders! I'm tired of chasing his Avatar! I mean, who does Zuko think he is? \n",
      "IROH: Do you really want to know? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Jee is shown standing up at the sound of Iroh's voice. \n",

      "JEE: Of course, sir. \n",

      "YOUNG.ZUKO: Let me in! \n",
      "IROH: [Places his hands on Zuko's shoulders.] Prince Zuko, what's wrong? \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: I want to go into the war chamber [Points to the guard.] but the guard won't let me pass! \n",
      "IROH: [Leads Zuko away with his left hand still on his shoulder.] You're not missing anything, trust me. These meetings are dreadfully boring. \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: If I'm going to rule this nation one day, don't you think I need to start learning as much as I can? \n",
      "IROH: Very well. But you must promise not to speak. [Another elder soldier walks by them into the war chamber.] These old folks are a bit sensitive, you know? \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: [Bows to Iroh.] Thank you, Uncle. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko and Iroh walk into the war room. The meeting starts. \n",
      "BUJING: The Earth Kingdom defenses are concentrated here. [Bujing shows the place on the map.] A dangerous battalion of their strongest earthbenders and fiercest warriors. So I am recommending the forty-first division. \n",
      "ELDER.SOLDIER: But the forty-first is entirely new recruits. How do you expect them to defeat a powerful Earth Kingdom battalion? \n",
      "BUJING: I don't. They'll be used as a distraction while we mount an attack from the rear. What better to use as bait than fresh meat? \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: [Zuko is shown standing up.] You can't sacrifice an entire division like that! Those soldiers love and defend our nation! How can you betray them? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Camera shows everyone in the war room staring at Zuko, save for Iroh, who is kneeling behind his nephew. The scene changes back to the present time. \n",
      "IROH: Zuko was right, you see, [Massages his beard again.] but it was not his place to speak out. And there were dire consequences. [Slightly bows his head.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes back to Aang and Katara. \n",
      "KATARA: So you were upset that you were the Avatar? Why wouldn't you be excited about it? \n",
      "AANG: Well, I didn't know how to feel about it. All I knew was that after I found out, everything began changing. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes back to flashback. Aang enters into the South Wall again. The Air Nomad kids are shown on air scooters. \n",
      "AANG: Hey, not bad! You guys have been practicing! \n",
      "AIR.NOMAD.BOY.#2: Not only that! We made up a game you can play with the air scooters! \n",
      "AANG: Great! [Aang is shown making his own. But everyone else makes theirs vanish.] What's going on? \n",
      "AIR.NOMAD.BOY.#1: Now that you're the Avatar, it's kind of an unfair advantage for whichever team you're on. \n",
      "AANG: But I'm still the same! Nothing's changed! So, what? I can't play? \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Gyatso and Aang laugh. Monk Tashi appears. \n",
      "TASHI: You're playing games with him? The Avatar should be training! \n",
      "GYATSO: Aang has already trained enough for today. \n",
      "TASHI: Time is short. [To Aang.] Come with me. I must test you on some high level techniques. \n",
      "GYATSO: No. As long as I'm his guardian, I will decide when he trains ... and when he gets his butt kicked at Pai Sho. \n",
      "TASHI: Hmph. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Monk Tashi is shown walking away. The flashback ends, and the scene changes to on Zuko's ship. A flashback appears of the fire in front of the Fire Lord's throne rising. \n",
      "IROH: After Zuko's outburst in the meeting, the Fire Lord became very angry with him. [Flashback quickly ends.] He said the challenge against the general was an act of complete disrespect! And there was only one way to resolve this. \n",
      "JEE: Agni Kai. A fire duel. \n",
      "IROH: That's right. Zuko looked upon the old general he had insulted and declared that he was not afraid. But Zuko misunderstood. [Flashback shows an overview of the chamber; the camera cuts to show Zuko preparing for the Agni Kai.] When he turned to face his opponent, he was surprised to see it was not the general. [Flashback shows the tippet that was on Zuko's shoulders fall down to the ground.] Zuko had spoken out against the general's plan, but by doing so in the Fire Lord's war room, it was the Fire Lord whom he had disrespected. [Frontal shot of a surprised Zuko; as the camera zooms in on him, his expression changes to one of fear.] Zuko would have to duel his own father. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a wall of the cave. The shot pans down to show Katara and a sad-looking Aang around their campfire. While Momo is asleep in his lap, Aang stares off into the fire with unseeing eyes as he continues his story. \n",

      "GYATSO: All I want is what is best for him. \n",
      "PASANG: But what we need is what's best for the world. You and Aang must be separated! The Avatar will be sent away to the Eastern Air Temple to complete his training. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang is shown looking through a hole in the ceiling, shocked at the news that he just heard. \n",
      "KATARA: That's awful, Aang. I don't know what to say. \n",
      "AANG: [Stands up.] How could they do that to me? They wanted to take away everything I knew and everyone I loved! [He activates the Avatar State.] \n",
      "KATARA: Whoa! Hot cinders! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang comes out of the Avatar State, walks to the fire, and sits down again. \n",
      "AANG: I'm sorry I got so mad. \n",
      "KATARA: You have the right to be angry after the monks sent you away like that. \n",
      "AANG: Well, that's not exactly what happened. [Flashback starts again, showing Aang looking out the window of his bedroom.] I was afraid and confused. I didn't know what to do. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Flashback shows Aang lying on his bed before changing to Gyatso walking to Aang's room. \n",
      "GYATSO: Aang, I'm not going to let them take you away from me. Aang? [Gyatso is shown opening the door more, spotting the scroll, and opening it up. He gasps, and sees a storm coming outside the window.] \n",
      "AANG: [Still in present, but flashback playing still.] I never saw Gyatso again. [Flashback shows Aang and Appa through the storm, and how Aang got into the iceberg.] Next thing I knew, I was waking up in your arms after you found me in the iceberg. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Flashback shows Katara's face that was seen in \"The Boy in the Iceberg\". The flashback ends. \n",
      "KATARA: You ran away. \n",
      "AANG: And then the Fire Nation attacked our temple. My people needed me and I wasn't there to help. \n",

      "AANG: The world needed me and I wasn't there to help. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang ... \n",
      "AANG: The fisherman was right! I did turn my back on the world! \n",
      "KATARA: You're being too hard on yourself, even if you did run away. I think it was meant to be. If you had stayed, you would have been killed along with all the other airbenders. \n",
      "AANG: You don't know that. \n",
      "KATARA: I know it was meant to be this way. The world needs you now. You give people hope. \n",

      "YOUNG.ZUKO: [Cut to a side-view of Zuko.] Please, Father. I only had the Fire Nation's best interest at heart. I'm sorry I spoke out of turn! [Slightly lowers his head.] \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a frontal view of Zhao, Iroh, and Azula in the crowd. While Iroh clenches his teeth and looks fearful and worried on Zuko's behalf, Zhao looks on with a smirk on his face, while Azula smiles and raises her left fist in front of her chest in anticipation. \n",
      "IROH: [Voice-over; Iroh closes his eyes and averts his head to the left.] I looked away. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As the sound of a fire blast is heard, Zuko is screaming \"no\", which echoes. While the faces of the spectators are brightened by the flames, the camera slowly zooms in on Iroh's averted face. The scene switches from the past to the present, where Iroh is sitting in the same manner. \n",
      "JEE: I always thought that Prince Zuko was in a training accident. \n",
      "IROH: It was no accident. After the duel, the Fire Lord said that by refusing to fight, Zuko had shown shameful weakness. As punishment, he was banished and sent to capture the Avatar. Only then could he return with his honor. \n",
      "JEE: So that's why he's so obsessed. Capturing the Avatar is the only chance he has of things returning to normal. \n",
      "IROH: Things will never return to normal. But the important thing is the Avatar gives Zuko hope. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to show Zuko meditating, while having flashbacks of his younger life. He is stopped by a hit on the ship. Scene changes to Aang and Katara. The fisherman's wife appears. \n",
      "FISHERMAN'S.WIFE: Help! Oh, please help! \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang shows up. He jumps down onto the boat. As a pole is falling down, Aang brings up fours pouts of water, splitting the pole in half. After the pole splits in half, Sokka and the fisherman are shown hugging each other. A rope is seen. \n",
      "AANG: Hang onto the rope. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The fisherman and Sokka do so. Appa starts flying again. The rope swings up, making Sokka and the fisherman land on the saddle. A big wave hits the gang underwater.

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The fisherman hands Sokka a fish. Katara and Aang are shown in a corner of the cave. \n",
      "AANG: Katara, I think you were right before. I'm done dwelling on the past. \n",
      "KATARA: Really? \n",
      "AANG: I can't make guesses about what would have turned out if I hadn't run away. I'm here now and I'm going to make the most out of it. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene opens on a messenger hawk flying toward an imposing Fire Nation fortress as the scene changes to its tower. The camera pans across the tri-level fortress and it's tall balconies before settling on a courtyard where a group of archers stand at the ready. Switch to a closer shot of a single archer. The archer draws his bow and releases three times in succession, sharply and accurately. Switch to a shot of the bowman's target. The first arrow strikes dead center, the second arrow splits the first arrow in half, and the third arrow splits the second arrow in half and completely impales the target. Switch back to a shot of the archers as they draw their bows. The camera pans up to a balcony where Colonel Shinu is arguing heatedly with Commander Zhao. \n",
      "SHINU: [In response to Zhao; somewhat angrily.] Absolutely not! The Yuyan Archers stay here. Your request is denied, Commander Zhao. \n",
      "ZHAO: Colonel Shinu, please reconsider ... Their precision is legendary. The Yuyan can pin a fly to a tree from one hundred yards away ... without killing it. [Annoyed.] You're wasting their talents using them as mere security guards. \n",
      "SHINU: I can do whatever I want with their talents, they're my archers, and what I say goes. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zhao turns to face the colonel, frustrated and angry. \n",
      "ZHAO: But my search for the Avatar is- \n",
      "SHINU: [Cutting Zhao off mid-sentence while getting close to him and scoffing angrily.] Is nothing but a vanity project! We're fighting a real war here, and I need every man I've got, commander. \n",
      "ZHAO: But-! \n",
      "SHINU: [Furiously.] That's final! I don't wanna hear another word about it! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zhao fumes. In the background, the cry of a messenger hawk is heard. Camera shifts to an above view and follows a messenger hawk as it reaches Colonel Shinu. Shinu opens the container on the hawk's back and reads the message inside with a puzzled expression. \n",
      "ZHAO: [Intrigued.] News from Fire Lord Ozai? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Shinu hands Zhao the message with irritation. Zhao takes the message, rudely brushing past the Colonel as he reads the news. Zhao smiles smugly. \n",
      "ZHAO: [Pleased.] It appears I've been promoted to Admiral. My request ... is now an order. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Colonel Shinu bows respectfully, and leaves.\n",
      "Shot of the Yuyan archers practicing. Zhao surveys their work with a glad expression playing on his face. The camera pans up to the roof of the tower where a mysterious figure in a blue mask is perched, seemingly for the entire conversation. The masked man disappears into the shadows. Switch to a shot of a vast mountain range. The landscape is blanketed with a ruined city.\n",
      "The scene changes to a shot inside one of the ruined buildings where Team Avatar has set up camp. Sokka is lying against Appa, huddled in his sleeping bag. He is coughing, and there is sweat on his face. \n",
      "KATARA: [Pressing a wet rag onto Sokka's forehead.] This should bring your fever down. \n",
      "SOKKA: You know what I love about Appa the most? His sense of humor. \n",
      "KATARA: That's nice. I'll tell him. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa growls. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Laughs.] Classic Appa. \n",
      "AANG: How's Sokka doing? \n",
      "KATARA: Not so good, being out in that storm really did a number on him. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka starts sniffing pitifully. \n",
      "AANG: I couldn't find any ginger root for the tea. But I found a map. There's an herbalist institute on top of that mountain. We could probably find a cure for Sokka there. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, he's in no condition for travel. Sokka just needs more rest. I'm sure he'll be better by tomorrow. [Starts coughing.] \n",
      "AANG: Not you too! \n",
      "KATARA: Relax, it was just a little cough. I'm fi- [She coughs again, this time with greater force, and lightly groans after.] \n",
      "AANG: [Shielding his face.] That's how Sokka started yesterday. Now look at him! He thinks he's an earthbender! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Delirious.] Take that, you rock! [He flails his arms as if he is hitting something.] \n",
      "AANG: A few more hours and you'll be talking nonsense, too. I'm going to go find some medicine! [He grabs his glider and begins to head out just as a flash of lightning strikes.] Uh, maybe it's safer if I go on foot. [To Appa and Momo.] Keep an eye on them guys. [Appa groans while Momo chitters.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Ha, ha! You guys are killing me! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang jumps, and uses airbending to help him run faster. The scene switches to Prince Zuko's ship. \n",
      "CAPTAIN: We haven't been able to pick up the Avatar's trail since the storm, but if we continue heading northeast ... [A larger Fire Nation ship pulls up next to theirs.] \n",
      "ZUKO: What do they want? \n",
      "IROH: Perhaps, a sporting game of Pai Sho! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A soldier from the other ship walks in. \n",
      "SOLDIER: [To Zuko.] The hunt for the Avatar has been given prime importance. All information regarding the Avatar must be reported directly to Admiral Zhao. \n",
      "IROH: Zhao has been promoted? Well, good for him! [As Iroh makes a move in his Pai Sho game, another player slaps his hand against his own forehead as if he lost.] \n",
      "ZUKO: [Looking down.] I've got nothing to report to Admiral Zhao. Now get off my ship and let us pass. \n",
      "SOLDIER: Admiral Zhao is not allowing ships in or out of this area. \n",
      "ZUKO: Off my ship! \n",
      "IROH: [Iroh wins his game.] Excellent! I take the pot! [A crew member punches himself.] But you're all improving! I'm certain you will win if we play again. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene switches to a hidden outpost. One soldier is looking at Aang's wanted poster while the other is on watch duty. \n",
      "SCOUT.#1: [Reading Aang's wanted poster out loud.] Says here that the Avatar can create tornadoes and run faster than the wind. Pretty amazing! \n",
      "SCOUT.#2: Ah, that's just a bunch of Fire Lord propaganda! There's no way that's true! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scout returns to his task and sees a cloud moving swiftly along the ground which turns out to be Aang. Aang runs by wrecking the outpost on accident. One of the scouts blows a horn signaling that Aang has been spotted.\n",
      "The scene changes back to the gang's camp. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Weakly.] Katara, please, water. \n",
      "KATARA: [Also weak.] Listen carefully, Momo. [Holds up a water skin.] I need you to take this to the river, and fill it with water. [She is shown through Momo's eyes, speaking gibberish.] Got it? [Momo takes the skin and flies off.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang runs up the stairs and enters the green house. \n",
      "AANG: [Speaking fast.] Hello, I'm sorry to barge in like this, but I need some medicine for my friends, they have fevers and they were coughing- [Gets cut off by the herbalist.] \n",
      "HERBALIST: Settle down, young man. Your friends are going to be fine. I've been up here for over forty years you know, used to be others, but they all left years ago. [She pets Miyuki who begins to purr.] Now it's just me and Miyuki. \n",
      "AANG: That's nice. \n",
      "HERBALIST: Wounded Earth Kingdom troops still come by now and again, brave boys, and thanks to my remedies they always leave in better shape they when they arrive. \n",
      "AANG: That's nice. Are you almost done? \n",
      "HERBALIST: Hold on, I just need to add one last ingredient. [Walking among the shrubbery, looking around and muttering to herself.] Oh, sandalwood ... oh, er, uh, that won't do, banana leaf? Ah, nope, uh, ginger root, uh uh, oh where is that pesky little plant? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang looks exasperated in the background and face-palms himself. Cut to Zuko's ship steaming by the shore, the sunset in its last stages in the background. Cut to Zuko practicing firebending on the foredeck in the background. Iroh's arm comes into the frame. \n",
      "IROH: Is everything okay? It's been almost an hour and you haven't given the men an order. \n",
      "ZUKO: I don't care what they do. \n",
      "IROH: Don't give up hope yet. You can still find the Avatar before Zhao. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Turning back, desperation and fear on his face.] How, Uncle? With Zhao's resources, it's just a matter of time before he captures the Avatar. [Turns back out to sea and whispers.] My honor, my throne, my country, I'm about to lose them all. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut back to an exterior shot of the herbalist institute, followed by a shot of the old woman in front of some bushes. \n",
      "HERBALIST: Ah! Plum blossom! [She plucks a flower from the tree.] \n",
      "AANG: [He lifts up his head off the table.] Finally! [Close-up of the mixing bowl as the herbalist drops the flower into the mixture, and Aang grabs for the bowl.] Thanks for all your help! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene moves back, just as Aang wants to yank the bowl out of the herbalist's hands, and she slaps his hands roughly away with her spoon. \n",
      "HERBALIST: Hands off! \n",
      "AANG: Ow! \n",
      "HERBALIST: [Close-up, holding her spoon at the ready for a new attack.] What do you think you're doing? \n",
      "AANG: [Rubs his hand, flinching.] Taking the cure to my friends. \n",
      "HERBALIST: [Lowers her spoon; laughs.] This isn't a cure! It's Miyuki's dinner. Plum blossom is her favorite. \n",
      "AANG: What about my friends? \n",
      "HERBALIST: Well, all they need are some frozen wood frogs. There's plenty down in the valley swamp. \n",
      "AANG: [Confused.] What am I supposed to do with frozen frogs? \n",
      "HERBALIST: Why, suck on them of course! \n",
      "AANG: [Shocked and disgusted; his eye twitches.] Suck on them? \n",
      "HERBALIST: The frog skin excretes a substance that will cure your friends. Be sure to get plenty because once those little critters thaw out, they're useless! \n",
      "AANG: You're insane, aren't you? \n",
      "HERBALIST: [Crazily.] That's right! Well, don't stand there all day! Go! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang runs out and the storm gets worse; he wipes his face from the excessive rainfall. Several arrows comes out of nowhere and pins Aang's pants to the ground; he airbends a shield sending some off them away. Aang removes one. \n",
      "AANG: Uh ... I think you dropped this ... [Screams as he sees the Yuyan Archers taking aim at him. Panicking, he frees himself from the arrow that had pinned his foot to the ground and runs. He falls off a cliff into a swamp and finds the frozen frogs.] A frog! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang sticks the frog in his shirt and manages to get four more before getting one of his sleeves pinned to a rock. Aang waterbends an ice wall in front of himself. An arrow strikes the wall before two more land in the same spot and slice the arrows that came before it. The ice cracks and another set of arrows pin his other sleeve before a net is launched at him.\n",
      "The scene cuts to show Aang bounded at his legs and arms with chains, barely able to move. He looks angry and struggles against the chains. \n",
      "ZHAO: So this is the great Avatar. Master of all the elements. I don't know how you've managed to elude the Fire Nation for a hundred years, but your little game of hide and seek is over. \n",
      "AANG: [Angry.] I've never hidden from you! Untie me and I'll fight you right now! \n",
      "ZHAO: Uhh, no. Tell me, how does it feel to be the only airbender left? Do you miss your people? [Aang looks down sadly.] Don't worry, you won't be killed like they were. [Aang looks angry again.] See, if you die you will just be reborn and the Fire Nation would have to start searching all over again. So I'll keep you alive, but just barely. [Aang takes a deep breath and blows at gale force at Zhao, who falls over.] Blow all the wind you want, but your situation is futile. There is no escaping this fortress, and no one is coming to rescue you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zhao exits the room with the door slamming behind him. Back to Katara and Sokka snuggled up in their sleeping bags which lie between Appa's feet. Sokka has a coughing fit. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Weakly.] Water ... \n",
      "KATARA: [Weakly.] Momo should be back any minute. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo jumps into the shot, chittering happily. He jumps up close to Katara. He drops a dead mouse on to her chest. She looks at it in disgust. \n",
      "KATARA: [Weakly; in disgust.] Ugh! No, Momo, water. Wa-ter! [Momo's ear go straight up. He jumps off her and scampers.] Aang, what in the world is taking you so long? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to an overhead shot of Aang still bound between the pillars, still trying to get out of the chains. The scene changes again, to several exterior night shots of the fortress, culminating in a long shot of the Blue Spirit. The camera zooms in three step changes to a close-up of the Blue Spirit, who moves left. Cut to a view of the road leading to the fortress where a wagon is making its way toward the gate. Cut to a view of the undercarriage of the wagon as it passes. The Blue Spirit is holding on to the underside of the wagon. The wagon reaches the gate. \n",
      "GUARD: All clear. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A gate guard looks at the wagon and walks around it. When the guard checks the undercarriage, the Blue Spirit is gone. The guard gets back up. Cut to a wider shot of the wagon and the guards around it. \n",
      "GUARD: All clear. Go on in. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Shift to a view from inside the wagon where the Blue Spirit has hidden himself; cut to an overhead shot of the wagon as it enters the first of the fortress' three gates. The shot pans up to rest on the massive central tower where Aang is held prisoner. Cut to a view of the first courtyard where the boxes in the wagon have been unloaded. The Blue Spirit runs from them and ducks into the shadows. Cut to a shot of an ornate balcony with bonfire pots on either side. The balcony is festooned with gold and red spades. Admiral Zhao appears flanked by attendants. During his speech the view cuts to show the innermost courtyard full of Fire Nation soldiers standing at attention. \n",
      "ZHAO: We are the sons and daughters of fire, the superior element! Until today only one thing stood our path to victory, the Avatar. I am here to tell you that he is now my prisoner! [The crowd cheers.] This is the year Sozin's Comet returns to grant us its power! [The crowd cheers.] This is the year the Fire Nation breaks through the walls of Ba Sing Se and burns the city to the ground! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As Zhao speaks, various shots are seen of the Blue Spirit steadily and stealthily infiltrating the fortress. Cut back to Aang, still struggling fruitlessly against his chains. He finally stops, breathing heavily. It's useless. Suddenly, frogs start leaping out of his shirt. \n",
      "AANG: [To the frogs.] What? No! Don't leave, frogs! My friends are sick and they need you! Please go back to being frozen! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He begins to struggle again as the frogs hop away toward the door, croaking. Cut to the four guards standing outside the chamber. They begin to look confused when they hear croaking. They look down to see the frogs coming from underneath the door. Suddenly they look up as a Fire Nation soldier's helmet comes bouncing down the corridor toward them. One of the guards walks up the corridor and turns right at the first junction, disappearing from view. A gout of flame erupts from the cross hallway as well as the sound of a brief scuffle. Two more guards go up to the junction and turn right, firebending stances at the ready. Cut to a view looking down the cross hallway. The first guard who went is hanging from the ceiling, tied up. Shift to the hanging soldier and pan up to reveal the Blue Spirit on the ceiling above the two new combatants. He drops down and melee begins, but it is over quickly. Cut back to the last guards, where they now see the Blue Spirit at the junction.\n",
      "Cut to a view of the door to Aang's chamber. The lone guard grabs the alarm horn next to him, but a knife knocks it out of his hand. The guard lets loose a gout of flame at the Blue Spirit as he runs down the hall toward the door, but the intruder extinguishes the blast with a bucket of water, and proceeds to sweeps the guard's feet out from under him with the empty bucket. Cut to Aang still struggling inside the chamber. He stops and looks at the noises of violence coming from through door. These stop abruptly and are replaced by the sound of the lock turning in the door. The door opens and the Blue Spirit enters. He brandishes two curved swords and runs forward to Aang, who screams in fear. The Blue Spirit approaches and two sword cuts are heard. Aang pulls his arms back in surprise – the Blue Spirit has freed him. He looks at his liberator in wonder. The Blue Spirit comes closer and cuts his remaining bonds, turns and walks back toward the door. \n",
      "AANG: Who are you? What's going on? Are you here to rescue me? [The Blue Spirit opens the door and motions for him to follow.] I'll take that as a \"yes.\" \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang follows him out past the gagged and tied guard at the door to his chamber. He hears frog noises and turns to see his half-frozen frogs crawling on the floor. \n",
      "AANG: My frogs! Come back! And stop thawing out! [The Blue Spirit comes back, picks him up by the collar and carries him out.] Wait! My friends need to suck on those frogs! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Meanwhile, back at the run-down temple, Momo has succeeded in piling up mountains of junk around Katara, but no water. Momo returns again with a crown. \n",
      "KATARA: [With a weak, sickly voice.] How many times do I have to tell you, Momo? We need water, wa-ter. Oh forget it. Aang, please, hurry. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Delirious.] Who's this \"Aang\" kid you keep talking about, Your Highness? [Katara gets an annoyed look on her face.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene shifts back to a few exterior shots of the fortress before switching to Aang and the Blue Spirit walking silently in the sewer system underneath the fortress. Soldiers walk back and forth above them. They hope out of a grate and into one of the courtyards. Cut to Zhao walking in one of the torch-lit corridors of the fortress, followed by a scribe. \n",
      "ZHAO: I want a full transcription of my speech sent to the Fire Lord, along with glowing testimonials from all of the ranking officers present, and – \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He cuts himself off as he hears moans. Cut to Zhao's right, where the soldiers that the Blue Spirit tied still lie. Zhao, upset, slams open the door to Aang's prison cell. It is empty, except for a frog which croaks at him from the floor. Zhao turns in anger and leaves, the scribe in tow. \n",
      "SCRIBE: Sir, should I hold off sending that speech to the Fire Lord? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut back to the two would-be escapees who are now scaling a rope on the innermost wall of the fortress. They are spotted and the view zooms out as one of the guards shouts. \n",
      "SOLDIER: There, on the wall! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A soldier appears at the top of the wall they are climbing. He cuts the rope and the pair fall down the wall, Aang screaming. Cut to side-view where Aang airbends them to a soft landing. When the dust clears, the Blue Spirit unsheathes his swords and they run. Cut to Zhao on the ornate balcony. \n",
      "ZHAO: [Shouting.] The Avatar has escaped! Close all the gates immediately! [Cut to the escapees running, Aang passes the Blue Spirit.] \n",
      "AANG: Stay close to me! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The third gate is closing in front of them, as are the two beyond it, and it is blocked by many soldiers. Aang airbends a blast of air that blows them out of the way. Aang makes for the gate, but the Blue Spirit gets involved in melee and has to stop and fend them off. Aang turns to see the Blue Spirit in trouble. He grabs a spear from a guard near him, airbends him out of the way, spins it around and breaks the head off the spear on the ground and launches back into battle to save his new friend. The gate closes behind him. The Blue Spirit is surrounded, but Aang airbends them all out of the way. With a mighty effort, he catapults the Blue Spirit to the top of the third wall.\n",
      "He is instantly surrounded, but Aang appears using the stick as a helicopter blade. He plucks the Blue Spirit off the wall and heads into the next courtyard. Cut to a close-up of Aang struggling to keep them aloft. The Blue Spirit uses his swords to knock the spears sent up at them by the guards. They barely next the top of the next wall as they crash unceremoniously onto the battlement. Aang's stick goes spinning away as guards instantly rush them. Aang runs for his stick, but a guard stops him, taking several swings at Aang with his sword. The Blue Spirit throws the guard over the wall. Aang airbends the other guards off the wall.\n",
      "Cut to a wide shot of the second wall, where more soldiers are scaling ladders. Aang and the Blue Spirit knock off the soldiers as they reach the top. With two mighty blasts, Aang depopulates the two scaling ladders nearest him as the Blue Spirit knocks the one final soldier off his. Aang brings over his two scaling ladders and steps onto the one the Blue Spirit has just emptied. He hands one ladder to the Blue Spirit. \n",
      "AANG: Take this. Jump on my back! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Blue Spirit complies and Aang begins to use the ladders as massive stilts, shedding one each time a step is taken. Cut to a wide shot of the second courtyard, where dawn is approaching in the background. The first ladder shed still has some Fire Nation soldiers on it, but it falls into the dust. \n",
      "AANG: Give me the next one! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Blue Spirit again complies. Cut to the bottom of their final stilt where a Fire Nation soldier sends a gout of flame up the ladder. It is too late though, as Aang and the masked man jump from the last stilt and just manage to grab the edge of the final wall. They are unable to hold on, however, and fall to the ground. The Blue Spirit draws his swords. Four firebenders unleash their flame on them, but Aang puts the masked man behind him and airbends the flames away. \n",
      "ZHAO: Hold your fire! The Avatar must be captured alive! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Blue Spirit instantly comes up behind Aang and crosses his swords in front of Aang's throat, surprising him. Cut to a view behind the escapees that pans right slowly, accenting the stand-off, before cutting to the implacable blue mask of the intruder. Cut back to a close of Zhao's eyes. \n",
      "ZHAO: [Through gritted teeth.] Open the gate. \n",
      "OFFICER: Admiral, what are you doing? \n",
      "ZHAO: Let them out, now! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The gate is opened and the Blue Spirit backs out with his captives, swords still at his throat. Cut back to Zhao, the officer questioning him still visible over his left shoulder. \n",
      "OFFICER: How could you let them go? \n",
      "ZHAO: A situation like this requires ... precision. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Blue Spirit continues backing away from the fortress. Zhao now looks on from the top of the main gate. Cut to an arrow being strung on a bow by an unseen soldier; cut back to Zhao, who looks to his right as he speaks. \n",
      "ZHAO: Do you have a clear shot? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a Yuyan Archer, who is silent, but aims. \n",
      "ZHAO: Knock out the thief. I'll deliver him to the Fire Lord along with the Avatar. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The archer releases his arrow, which the camera follows across the field to its impact point on the Blue Spirits masks. Cut to a side-view of Aang and the Blue Spirit as the masked man collapses backward in slow motion. Aang turns in horror, his eyes glazed. He recovers, turns around and airbends up a huge cloud of dust around him and the Blue Spirit. \n",
      "ZHAO: Quick! Recover the Avatar! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the main gate opening and a crowd Fire Nation soldiers emerging and running toward the dust cloud. Cut to inside the dust cloud, where Aang removes the Blue Spirit's mask to reveal Zuko. Aang starts back in horror and falls backward on the ground. He jumps up and runs away, but turns to look at Zuko, his eyes huge and full of compassion. He sees the Fire Nation soldiers getting close through the smoke. Still, he hesitates. When the dust clears, however, the soldiers find nothing. Cut back to Zhao, looking insanely angry. A frog hops up onto the railing, croaks, and hops off. Fade to white, followed by a blurry shot of a forest looking straight up into the canopy overhead. It is morning. The screen pans down to Aang sitting on a nearby root, the view is still blurry. He looks forlorn. Cut to Zuko, whose view we were clearly just seeing. He looks a bit dazed still. \n",
      "AANG: [To Zuko.] You know what the worst part of being born over a hundred years ago is? I miss all the friends I used to hang out with. Before the war started, I used to always visit my friend Kuzon. The two of us, we'd get in and out of so much trouble together. He was one of the best friends I ever had, and he was from the Fire Nation, just like you. If we knew each other back then, do you think we could have been friends, too? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a wide shot of Zuko lying on the ground, Aang next to him, perched a large tree root. After a pause, Zuko lets loose a huge fireball at him, but Aang dodges and flies away on a current of air. Zuko watches him hop away from tree branch to tree branch and out sight. Cut to Zuko as the camera slowly zooms backward. Zuko raises his eye in consideration. Fade to a close-up of the swamp, where Aang is collecting frozen frogs once again. Cut back to a wide shot of Zuko's ship reeling in the cutter vessel back into the mother ship. Shift to Zuko, sullen, walking past his Uncle on the main deck. \n",
      "IROH: Where have you been, Prince Zuko? You missed music night! Lieutenant Jee sang a stirring love song. \n",
      "ZUKO: I'm going to bed. No disturbances. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Iroh rubs his head and begins to blow his horn again. Fade back to the ruins. Aang returns, downcast. He puts frogs in his friends' mouths. \n",
      "AANG: Suck on these. They'll make you feel better. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang collapse backward onto Appa's tail with a sigh. Cut to Sokka with a frog in his mouth. \n",
      "SOKKA: [With his mouth full; still spouting out nonsense.] Aang, how was your trip? Did you make any new friends? \n",
      "AANG: No, I don't think I did. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang rolls over. Fade to Prince Zuko lying awake in his own chamber, lost in thought. He looks at the Fire Nation symbol hanging on his wall, and rolls over himself. Cut back to the ruins and to Sokka, a happy expression on his face, still sucking on the frog in his mouth. \n",
      "SOKKA: Mmmm! This is tasty! Mmm! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: It thaws out and begins moving around and croaking. Sokka realizes what it is and spits it out in disgust. Cut to Katara where her frog has also thawed. She cries out and it hops out of her mouth. Both Katara and Sokka begin spitting and coughing, Sokka rubs his tongue in panic against Appa's fur. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fades to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens to a sunny lake scene; Aang, Katara, and Sokka are sitting around a bundle of sticks with a blue tent behind Katara and are surrounded by trees and rocks. A large se tu suddenly bursts from the surface, leaps through the air, and lands with a splash into the water. Katara rises and points at it. \n",
      "KATARA: [Excitedly.] Look! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka rises to view the spectacle. The fish, a se tu, leaps into the air again, facing the group in mid-jump in slow-motion before landing in the water again. The camera cuts to Sokka and Katara. \n",
      "SOKKA: He is taunting us! [Camera zooms out to the lake and the group's camp site.] You are so going to be dinner! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He grabs his fishing pole from his tent set up nearby and attempts to cast the pole into the water unsuccessfully. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Observes the fishing pole.] Hey, where's the fishing line? \n",
      "AANG: [Sheepishly.] Oh, I didn't think you would need it, Sokka. [He holds up an intricately woven necklace decorated with a red flower.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Walks over and examines the necklace.] Aw, it's all tangled! \n",
      "AANG: [Rises to his feet.] Not tangled. Woven! I made you a necklace, Katara. I thought since you lost your other one ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He pauses in mid-sentence and displays the necklace, holding it between his hands as he flashes a toothy grin. \n",
      "KATARA: [Smiling and approaching him.] Thanks, Aang. [Takes the necklace.] I love it. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sarcastically.] Great, Aang. Maybe instead of saving the world, you can go into the jewelry-making business. \n",
      "AANG: I don't see why I can't do both. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: While saying this, Katara can be seen in the background, trying on her new necklace. Sokka turns back to the lake, where the se tu continues its acrobatic display. Sokka tosses the fishing line into the water in an attempt to spear the fish. He only grows more frustrated when he sees the se tu leap from the water, unharmed. \n",
      "SOKKA: Stop taunting me! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He runs into the water, holding his jawbone dagger. Aang watches him run off. \n",
      "KATARA: [Off-camera.] So, how do I look? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang turns to look at her, a bored expression on his face. His uninterested expression, however, soon transforms into one of awe and amazement. The camera focuses on Katara, panning upward from her feet to her head. The background around her has become colored with shades of pink and purple, sparkles of light glistening every now and then. The panshot reveals her smiling sweetly, blushing slightly with one hand behind her back and the other touching her necklace in a pose. The scene cuts to Aang, who nervously pulls at his collar with his hand, smiling awkwardly. \n",
      "AANG: [Nervously.] You mean, all of you or just your neck? [Puts his right hand behind his head in embarrassment.] I mean, because both look great! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Emerges from the water, holding the se tu.] Smoochie, smoochie, someone's in love! [Makes kissing noises before the se tu breaks free from his grasp, slapping Sokka in the face with its tail and disappearing under the water.] \n",
      "AANG: [Embarrassed.] I ... well, uh ... \n",
      "KATARA: [Annoyed.] Stop teasing him, Sokka. Aang's just a good friend. [Pats the side of his head.] A sweet, little guy! Just like Momo. [Pets Momo, who lands on Aang's shoulder.] \n",
      "AANG: [Dismayed.] Thanks. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka emerges empty-handed from the lake, soaking wet and cross. Momo suddenly flies off Aang's shoulder upon hearing a loud noise in the distance. He leaps onto a rock followed by Aang, who observes the scene. He points to the source of the commotion. \n",
      "AANG: [Urgently.] Someone's being attacked by a platypus bear! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera focuses on a large, ferocious creature having dark brown fur, the body and head of a bear, the tail and bill of a platypus and bearing a white \"V\" across its chest. The creature stands upright on its hind legs and swings at a man clad in blue, who smiles merrily, his hands behind his back. The man manages to avoid the bear's swing by calmly stepping backward. The creature continues its attacks as Aang leaps onto a rock directly behind it. The camera focuses on the calm man, who continues to smile as though nothing is occurring. \n",
      "CALM.MAN: Well, hello there! [Dodges another swift swing of the bear's claws.] Nice day, isn't it? \n",
      "AANG: Make noise! He'll run off! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka and Katara approach the scene. \n",
      "SOKKA: No, play dead! He'll lose interest! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The bear swings its claws only to miss striking the man once again. \n",
      "CALM.MAN: [Happily.] Whoa, close one! [Laughs bemusedly.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Cups a hand to her mouth and makes gestures with her other hand.] Run downhill, then climb a tree! \n",
      "SOKKA: No, punch him in the bill! [Swings a fist upward.] \n",
      "AANG: And then run in zig-zags! \n",
      "CALM.MAN: No need, it's going to be fine! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The platypus bear attempts to land a blow, cutting a large chunk of wood from the trunk of a nearby tree, the calm dodging the attack. Aang leaps into the air and lands onto the ground, placing himself between the calm man and the platypus bear. He sends the creature back slightly with an air blast. \n",
      "AANG: [Holding his hands out in front of him and assuming a fighting stance.] Whoa there! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The platypus bear only rears up on its hind legs further, letting out a loud cry. Appa suddenly appears from behind the bear and bellows, causing the animal to bristle in fear. The bear lays a large, spotted egg and escapes the scene, swimming down the river. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Joyfully picks up the egg.] Mmm, lunch! [He sniffs it.] Lucky for you, we came along. \n",
      "CALM.MAN: Thanks, but everything was already under control. Not to worry. Aunt Wu predicted I'd have a safe journey. [Folds hands together and bows slightly.] \n",
      "AANG: Aunt who? \n",
      "CALM.MAN: No, Aunt Wu. She's the fortuneteller from my village. Awful nice knowing your future. \n",
      "KATARA: [Looks off to the side as she ponders this.] Wow, it must be. [Faces the man with a bright expression on her face.] That explains why you were so calm! \n",
      "SOKKA: But the fortuneteller was wrong! You didn't have a safe journey; you were almost killed! \n",
      "CALM.MAN: [Cheerfully.] But I wasn't! All right, have a good one! [He bids them a farewell and begins to walk away only to turn back again.] Oh, and Aunt Wu said if I met any travelers to give them this. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He hands Aang a wrapped parcel seemingly containing a long, thin object and leaves mysteriously. Sokka eyes the man suspiciously. \n",
      "KATARA: [Excitedly.] Maybe we should go see Aunt Wu and learn our fortunes. It could be fun. \n",
      "SOKKA: Oh, come on. Fortune telling is nonsense! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang quickly unwraps the mysterious parcel, which turns out to be a red umbrella. He opens it and holds it over his head. \n",
      "AANG: What do you know? An umbrella! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: At that moment, the sky darkens and it begins to rain. A low rumble of thunder can be heard. Katara bends an arched shield of water over her head to shelter herself from the weather. \n",
      "KATARA: That proves it! [She ducks under the umbrella.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Holding egg above his head to shield himself from the rain.] No, it doesn't! You can't really tell the future! \n",
      "KATARA: [Smugly.] I guess you're not really getting wet then. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka suddenly loses his grip on the platypus egg as it flies through the air. He attempts to catch it, however, it merely flies a few feet into the air and lands on his head, cracking and causing the egg to run down his face. Cut to the group walking along the path; as the rain continues, Aang and Katara are sheltered under the umbrella, while Sokka stays away from them, drenched by the downpour. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Crossly.] Of course she predicted it was going to rain. The sky's been gray all day! \n",
      "KATARA: Just admit you might be wrong, and you can come under the umbrella. \n",
      "SOKKA: Look, I'm going to predict the future now. [Stops walking and hops from foot to foot in an exaggerated way.] It's going to keep drizzling. [The rain continues to fall.] See? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Suddenly, the rain stops falling and sky lightens up slightly. Cut to a shot of Aang and Katara, Aang titling the umbrella back to observe the dramatic change in weather. \n",
      "AANG: Not everyone has the gift, Sokka. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera cuts to a side-view of the entire team walking along the path in a strong, yet calm, breeze which rustles the grass on the side of the path. Aang and Katara continue to stroll leisurely under the umbrella ahead of Sokka. Appa plods behind, pausing briefly to shake his wet fur out, soaking Sokka in the process and causing him to flinch. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Disgusted.] Agh! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to a view of a large mountain, its peak covered in snow. The camera pans down to a small village, which lies at the mountain's very base. The team walks through the entrance into the village, turkey ducks quacking as they pass. The camera cuts to a strange man dressed in a black robe standing by a round doorway. \n",
      "STRANGE.MAN: Aunt Wu is expecting you. \n",
      "KATARA: [Excitedly.] Really? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The trio walks through the doorway, Sokka expressing his disgust. They enter a room, three pillows situated on the floor to the right of the room. The strange man closes the door. A young girl walks into the room clad in a pink robe and wearing her hair in braids that stick out from the sides of her head. \n",
      "MENG: My name is Meng and I'm Aunt Wu's assistant. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Her eyes suddenly widen. The camera cuts to a shot of Aang, panning upward from his feet to his head. The background is similar to that of Aang's romanticized shot of Katara. The pan shot reveals him to be quite bored and slumped over. Cuts to close-up of Meng. \n",
      "MENG: [Pleased.] Well, hello there. \n",
      "AANG: [Rubs nose in disinterest.] Hello. \n",
      "MENG: [Aang and Katara seat themselves on the pillows.] Can I get you some tea or some of Aunt Wu's special bean curd puffs? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Brightening.] I'll try a curd puff. \n",
      "MENG: [Holds up index finger in gesture.] Just a second. [To Aang.] So what's your name? \n",
      "AANG: [Flatly.] Aang. \n",
      "MENG: [Delighted.] That rhymes with Meng! And you've got some pretty big ears, don't you? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera cuts to a shot of Aang, somewhat exaggerating the size of his ears. \n",
      "AANG: [Awkwardly.] I guess. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Waves hand in dismissal and jokes.] Don't be modest! [Spreads arms outward in emphasis.] They're huge! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera cuts to a shot of the entire group, Aang covering his ears in embarrassment and glaring at Sokka. \n",
      "MENG: [Begins walking away.] Well, Aang, it was very nice to meet you. [Smiles slyly.] Very nice. [Turns and leaves.] \n",
      "AANG: Likewise. \n",
      "SOKKA: I can't believe we're here in the house of nonsense. \n",
      "KATARA: Try to keep an open mind, Sokka. There are things in this world that just can't be explained. Wouldn't it be nice to have some insight into your future? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Nonchalantly.] It would be nice to have some bean curd puffs. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to where Meng is shown approaching the room through a nearby hallway with a tray of bean curd puffs. A door in the hallway opens and a woman clad in green exits. She approaches Meng excitedly. \n",
      "WOMAN: Oh, Meng! Aunt Wu says I'm going to meet my true love. He's going to give me a rare panda lily. \n",
      "MENG: That's so romantic! [Dreamily, while casting Aang a flirtatious look.] I wonder if my true love will give me a rare flower. \n",
      "AANG: [Breezily.] Good luck with that! \n",
      "WOMAN: [Trying to contain her laughter.] Is that the big-eared guy who Aunt Wu predicted you'd marry? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Embarrassed by this statement, Meng pushes the woman aside and continues on her way to the other room. She approaches the team, her eyes fixated hopefully on Aang, who stares off into space, unaware of her presence. She suddenly trips; Aang attempts to help her recover, accidentally holding her hands in his in the process. The two stare at each other for a moment; Meng blushes. \n",
      "MENG: [Nervously.] Enjoy your snack! [Leaves in a hurry.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka takes the tray of curd puffs from Aang; he prepares to sample one only to be interrupted by an elderly woman, clad in a yellow robe, who enters the room. \n",
      "WU: Welcome, young travelers. Now, who's next? Don't be shy. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to a shot of the team. Sokka looks away uninterested and Aang casts a look at Katara. \n",
      "KATARA: [Rising in anticipation.] I guess that's me. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two exit. Aang and Sokka sit idly on the floor, Sokka tasting the curd puffs. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Delighted; with his mouth full.] Mm, not bad, not bad! [Holding out bowl to Aang.] Mhm? \n",
      "AANG: [Refusing the bowl.] I'm good on puffs. [Sokka shrugs and continues eating the puffs; trying to act casual.] So, what do you think they're talking about back there? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Causally, holding up puff.] Boring stuff I'm sure. Love, who she's going to marry, how many babies she's going to have. \n",
      "AANG: [Trying to act cool.] Yeah, dumb stuff like that ... [Tenses a bit and bites his fingers nervously.] Well, I've got to find a bathroom. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He rises and walks away off-screen. Sokka lies down, relaxed and samples another puff. While eating it, Momo comes on-screen and sneakily takes the bowl away for himself. Sokka places his hand down to grab another curd puff, only to open his eyes and realize the bowl is gone. Cuts to Aang, who tiptoes down the hallway to where Aunt Wu had led Katara into another room, clearly ready to eavesdrop on their conversation. Cuts to shot of Aang pressing his ear to the doorway. The following conversation between Aunt Wu and Katara occurs off-screen from behind the wall. \n",
      "WU: Your palms are so smooth. Do you use moisturizer? \n",
      "KATARA: Actually, I have this special seaweed lotion. I can get you some if you want. [Aang sticks out his tongue; slight pause.] So, do you see anything interesting in my love line? [Aang immediately perks up upon hearing this.] \n",
      "WU: [Somewhat dramatically.] I feel a great romance for you. The man you are going to marry. \n",
      "KATARA: [Excitedly.] Tell me more! \n",
      "WU: I can see that he's a very powerful bender. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Upon hearing this statement, Aang smiles mischievously and leaps in the hallway, delighted upon hearing this. Cuts to the room where Sokka sits, picking his teeth. Aang struts into the room happily. \n",
      "SOKKA: Looks like someone had a pretty good bathroom break. \n",
      "AANG: Yeah ... when I was in there ... \n",
      "SOKKA: [Disgusted, looking away and holding up a hand to signal Aang to stop.] I don't even want to know! \n",
      "WU: [Entering the room with Katara.] Who's next? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Rising.] Okay, let's get this over with. \n",
      "WU: [Dryly.] Your future is full of struggle and anguish. Most of it, self-inflicted. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Holding up his hands in protest.] But you didn't read my palms or anything! \n",
      "WU: I don't need to. It's written all over your face. [Sokka resumes picking his teeth in disgust; to Aang.] You there, come with me. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang follows Aunt Wu out of the room and into her chamber. The chamber is a fairly spacious, dimly lit room. Four pillars support the ceiling and four cushions are situated in the center of the room, surrounding a small fire. Off to the side is a jug of bones. Aunt Wu and Aang approach the jug. \n",
      "WU: This is the most reliable method of telling your fortune. The bones never lie. [Urging Aang to pick a bone.] Go on, pick one. [Aang takes one bone and they sit down.] Now throw it on the fire. [Aang tosses the bone into the fire.] The heat makes cracks in the bone and I read the bone cracks to tell your destiny. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to a shot of the bone sitting in the fire. The camera zooms in on the bone as a large crack splinters down its side. \n",
      "AANG: Wow, that's a big crack. \n",
      "WU: [Surprised.] I've never seen this before! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of the bone, camera panning to the right to show more cracks forming. The bone explodes and sends a burst of flames up to the ceiling. \n",
      "WU: [Her and Aang shielding their faces in surprise.] Oh my! [Cuts to shot of the bone lying in the fire and back to Aunt Wu who is fascinated.] Your destiny! This is incredible. You will be involved in a great battle, an awesome conflict between the forces of good and evil. A battle whose outcome will determine the fate of the whole world! \n",
      "AANG: [Casually.] Yeah, yeah, I knew that already. But did it say anything about a girl? \n",
      "WU: [Surprised.] A girl? You want to know about love? \n",
      "AANG: [Excited.] Yes! \n",
      "WU: I'm sorry, but I didn't see anything. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang looks down, disappointed at this. Aunt Wu realizes this. \n",
      "WU: [Trying to cheer him up.] Well, look! [Holding her hand against her face in mock forgetfulness.] I must've missed something. [Cuts to a bone piece lying on the floor; Wu picks it up.] Right here. [Holds bone up to examine it.] It says \"trust your heart and you will be with the one you love.\" \n",
      "AANG: Really? [Rises to his feet joyfully.] Thank you, Aunt Wu! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He runs out of the room gleefully. Aunt Wu hold her hand to her forehead and shakes her head in dismay. The scene changes to an overhead view of outside Wu's building, the three gathered together with Appa standing behind them. The three begin walking down a street. \n",
      "SOKKA: Well, now you got to see for yourselves how fortune telling is just a big, stupid hoax. \n",
      "KATARA: You're just saying that because you're going to make yourself unhappy your whole life. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Voice rising in anger.] That woman is crazy! My life will calm and happy and joyful! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He roughly kicks a nearby stone, which soars into the air and comically ends up ricocheting off a hanging metal sign and striking the warrior, who had been standing breezily with his arms crossed. He covers his head in pain and falls to the ground, off-camera. Hunched over out of view, he raises a finger into the frame in protest, his tone agitated. \n",
      "SOKKA: That doesn't prove anything! \n",
      "KATARA: [Satisfied.] Well, I liked my predictions. [Clasps her hands together anxiously.] Certain things are going to turn out very well. \n",
      "AANG: [Slyly, crossing his arms and leaning in toward her.] They sure are ... \n",
      "KATARA: Why? What did she tell you? \n",
      "AANG: [Ambiguously.] Some stuff. You'll find out. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara exits along with Aang, who folds his hands contentedly behind his head. Cuts to an overhead shot of the village courtyard, a pagoda-like structure lying centered in the middle. Cuts to shot of the villagers looking up at the sky before switching to a shot of the ground where the team approaches. \n",
      "KATARA: [Looking at the sky.] What's with the sky? \n",
      "CALM.MAN: [Also viewing the sky.] We are waiting for Aunt Wu to come and read the clouds to predict the fate of the whole village. \n",
      "AANG: [Pointing upward.] That cloud kind of looks like a fluffy bunny. \n",
      "CALM.MAN: [Slightly worried.] You better hope that's not a bunny! The fluffy bunny cloud forecasts doom and destruction. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Disgusted.] Do you even hear yourself? \n",
      "VILLAGE.WOMAN: [Gesturing to the mountain in the background.] The cloud reading will tell us if Mt. Makapu will remain dormant for another year or if it will erupt. \n",
      "CALM.MAN: We used to have a tradition once a year of going up the mountain to check the volcano ourselves. [Smiles.] But every since Aunt Wu moved to the village twenty years ago, we have a tradition of not doing that. \n",
      "SOKKA: I can't believe you would trust your lives to that crazy, old woman's superstition! \n",
      "KATARA: [Laying a hand on Sokka's shoulder.] Shhh! She's coming! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot from in between Katara and Sokka's heads. The camera zooms in to show Aunt Wu and her guard appearing on-screen, ascending a stairwell. Cuts to an overhead shot of the entire courtyard, the crowd having formed an aisle to allow for the two figures to pass by. Cuts to shot of Aang and Katara standing next to each other, smiling widely as Aunt Wu and the guard walk by them. The crowd is clapping for the fortuneteller. Meng appears on-screen next to Aang. \n",
      "MENG: [Trying to impress him.] Hey, Aang. [Pointing upward.] Don't you think that cloud looks like a flower? \n",
      "AANG: [Awkwardly.] Huh? Sure, I guess. [He pushes Meng away as the camera pans to the right; to Katara.] Hey, Katara, don't you think that cloud look like a flower? \n",
      "KATARA: [Annoyed.] Shhh! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang shows clear disappointment at being hushed. Cuts to the pagoda, where Aunt Wu approaches. She spreads her arms outward dramatically. Cuts to shot of the sky, an arrow-shaped cloud hovering above. Cuts to Aunt Wu who studies a cloud reading book in her hand. \n",
      "WU: [Thoughtfully.] Bending arrow cloud ... good crops this year. Nice big harvest. \n",
      "FARMER: [Hugs elderly woman happily.] Darn good news! \n",
      "WU: Wavy, moon-shaped cloud ... let's see. [Smiling.] Gonna be a great year for twins! \n",
      "POI.AND.PING: [High-five each other joyfully.] Yes! \n",
      "WU: [Thoughtfully.] And a cumulus cloud with a twisted nob coming off the end of it ... [Spreads arms outward again.] The village will not be destroyed by the volcano this year! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to an overhead shot of the courtyard, where the crowd cheers ecstatically. Cuts to shot of Aang and Katara standing among the crowds, their backs facing the camera. \n",
      "AANG: [Slightly nervous.] Since I got you here, uh, there's something I want to tell you. I like you, but more than normal. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara, enthralled with Aunt Wu and her predictions, runs off to follow the fortuneteller, clearly paying no attention to Aang. Aang becomes upset at this. \n",
      "AANG: [Crushed.] Never mind. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of the upper levels of Aunt Wu's building, the camera panning downward to its entrance. Cuts to the hallway leading to Aunt Wu's chamber, where Katara stands before the doorway and knocks. Aunt Wu slides open the door. \n",
      "KATARA: Hi, Aunt Wu! Sorry to bother you. \n",
      "WU: Any time. \n",
      "KATARA: About this man I'm supposed to marry ... [Looks down awkwardly and blushes.] Is he going to be handsome? [Clasps her hands together hopefully.] Oh, I hope he's tall! \n",
      "WU: Ah ... You want another reading? \n",
      "KATARA: Yes, please! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two enter the room with the door sliding closed behind them. Cuts to shot of upper portion of Sokka's head, an angered expression on his face as he marches past in the courtyard. \n",
      "SOKKA: I can't believe all these saps! [Cuts to side-view of Sokka walking forward, Aang following close behind.] Someone really needs to scream some sense into them. \n",
      "AANG: They seem happy, Sokka. \n",
      "SOKKA: Not for long. I'm going to prove Aunt Wu's predictions are nonsense. [Pulls over a man standing nearby.] Hey you, I bet Aunt Wu told you to wear those red shoes, didn't she? [Cuts to shot of the man's red shoes.] \n",
      "MAN: Yeah. She said I'd be wearing red shoes when I met my true love. \n",
      "SOKKA: Uh huh ... And how many times have you worn those shoes since you got that fortune? \n",
      "MAN: [Smiles sheepishly.] Everyday. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Background becomes a spiral of swirling orange and yellow flames; angry.] Then of course it's gonna come true! \n",
      "MAN: [Delighted.] Really? You think so? [Begins walking away.] I'm so excited! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: In a fit of anger, Sokka kicks a nearby stone; it flies off-screen and ends up comically hitting a turkey duck, which flies on-screen and begins attacking Sokka. The warrior crouches over and tries to ward of the bird. The scene changes to Aunt Wu's chamber, shot from the view of outside the doorway. Cuts to shot of Katara's hand outstretched as Aunt Wu traces her finger across her palm. \n",
      "WU: And then you will have your third great-grandchild before quietly passing away in your sleep. [Cuts to shot of Aunt Wu, who does not seem particularly happy.] Is that enough information for you? \n",
      "KATARA: [Lifts her palm in wonder.] Wow, thanks, Aunt Wu. [She rises and prepares to leave, but suddenly turns back.] Oh wait, one more thing. How warmly should I dress tomorrow? \n",
      "WU: You want me to do a reading for that? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of Katara, who nods almost crazily, a huge grin spread across her face. Cuts to outside in the courtyard where Aang stands behind Sokka, who is clearly ready to lose his mind, holding his hands up to his head in frustration. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Crazed.] I don't care what Aunt Wu told you! You have to take a bath sometime! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of a middle-aged man, covered in dirt and grime from head to toe. The man shrugs, grunts a bit and walks off smiling. \n",
      "AANG: So, Sokka, you know some stuff about ladies, right? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Pleased.] Some stuff? [Places an arm around Aang's shoulders.] You've come to the right place. What can I do you for? \n",
      "AANG: Well, there's this girl. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of Aang, Meng in the background, standing behind a barrel. She laughs. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Thinking of Meng rather than Katara.] I think I know who you mean. \n",
      "AANG: [Surprised.] You do? And you're okay with it? \n",
      "SOKKA: Of course I am. And to tell you the truth, I've been picking up a subtle vibe that she likes you, too. \n",
      "AANG: [Growing anxious; Meng tries to catch Aang's attention in the background.] She does? \n",
      "SOKKA: Oh yeah, she's crazy about you. All you have to do now is not mess it up. \n",
      "AANG: Well, how do I do that? \n",
      "SOKKA: The number once mistake nice guys like you make: being too nice. \n",
      "AANG: You can be too nice? \n",
      "SOKKA: Yep. If you want to keep her interested, you have to act aloof, like you don't really care one way or the other. \n",
      "AANG: Well, okay ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera shifts to show Meng approaching Aang shyly. \n",
      "MENG: Hey, Aang, I was wondering ... \n",
      "AANG: See you later ... [Walks away casually and waves hand breezily.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Meng sighs and her ears droop downward, like dog ears. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Impressed.] Wow, that kid is good. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to overhead shot of the entranceway to Aunt Wu's building, where a clearly impatient Wu is shoving Katara out the door. A couple of idle Turkey ducks scramble away. \n",
      "WU: And you'll be fine as long as you've got a scarf. Bye-bye now. \n",
      "KATARA: Okay, okay, but one more thing. \n",
      "WU: [Stares horrified at Katara before sighing and leaning forward slightly in surrender.] All right, what is it? \n",
      "KATARA: [Puts a hand to her chin thoughtfully.] Should I eat a mango or a papaya for breakfast tomorrow? \n",
      "WU: [Angrily.] Papaya! [Slams the door shut.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Kicks the ground, sending up a small cloud of dust.] Aww, I hate papaya. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The view widens to where Aang can be seen slumped against the wall of the building, trying to act aloof on Sokka's advice. \n",
      "AANG: [Breezily.] Oh, hey, Katara. I didn't see you there. \n",
      "KATARA: [Half-heartedly.] Hey, Aang. [Walks away.] \n",
      "AANG: [Trying to catch her attention.] That's okay. I'm busy with my own stuff. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang stands idly before a turkey duck flies over and lands near him. After a brief moment of looking at each other, the duck quacks. Cuts to shot from slightly behind the pagoda in the courtyard, where Katara is seen in the background standing by a fruit stand. \n",
      "KATARA: [Less than pleased.] Ugh, papaya please. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot from behind the stand, where Katara is seen on the opposite side of the vendor, taking a papaya from the seller's hands. Aang casually walks up to her, Momo perched on his shoulder. \n",
      "AANG: [Aloof.] So ... papaya. \n",
      "KATARA: Uh huh. Would you like some? \n",
      "AANG: [Causally, picking an apple from the stand.] You know me. I don't really care what I eat. \n",
      "KATARA: [Begins walking away.] Okay then. See you later. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She exits the scene as Aang bites into the apple only to spit out the contents afterward in disgust. \n",
      "AANG: [Slightly downcast.] Maybe aloof isn't my style. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He casts his gaze over to a man and the woman seen in Aunt Wu's building earlier, who stand in the background, the man having just offered something to the woman. \n",
      "WOMAN: [From afar; delighted.] Oh, a panda lily! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The couple embraces. Cuts to shot of Aang, who looks impressed by this display. \n",
      "AANG: [To Momo.] Did you see that? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to close-up of the panda lily, the camera zooming out to show the couple still embracing. Aang suddenly appears between the two, pushing them away from each other and startling both. \n",
      "AANG: Excuse me. [Pointing to the flower.] Where can a guy find one of those things? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to an area outside the village, a forested landscape in the background, Mt. Makapu standing magnificently behind the trees. Cuts to the side of the mountain, Aang leaping upward along the rocky outcrops. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Off-camera.] I can't believe you're dragging me all the way up here for a stupid flower. \n",
      "AANG: Not just any flower, a panda lily. I've seen it in action and boy, does it work. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of Sokka scaling the mountain. \n",
      "SOKKA: Flowers are fine once you're married, but at this early stage, it's critical that you maintain maximum aloofness. \n",
      "AANG: But my heart is telling me to get this flower, [Looks up toward the rim of the mountain.] and Aunt Wu said if I trusted in my heart, I will be with the one I love. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Irritated.] What? Don't tell me you believe in that stuff, too. \n",
      "AANG: [Cuts to shot of Aang perched on one boulder, Sokka appearing on-screen.] Well, Aunt Wu hasn't been wrong yet. Why should she be wrong about love? [Leaps upward and points in delight at the rim.] There! On the rim! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of the rim from the center of the volcano's peak, several lilies growing. Aang appears on-screen, picks a panda lily and smells it. He opens his eyes and gasps in horror. Cuts to a view of the crater, which is nearly filled to the brim with lava. Sokka appears beside Aang and also looks horrified. \n",
      "AANG: [Shocked.] Oh no. [Cuts to overhead shot of the volcano.] Aunt Wu was wrong. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He drops the panda lily which floats down into the lava, a flame appearing in its wake.

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of rim as they disappear over the edge, mounted on the glider. Cuts to shot of the treetops, Aang and Sokka appearing on-screen. Cuts to overhead shot of the village, as they fly toward it rapidly. Cuts to shot of Katara standing before the entrance of Wu's building clearly irritated. Aang and Sokka walk up to her, having now landed. \n",
      "AANG: [Shyly, raises hand slightly.] Hi, Katara. \n",
      "KATARA: [Annoyed.] Can you believe she won't let me in? And after all the business I've given her? \n",
      "AANG: But she doesn't even charge. \n",
      "KATARA: I know, but still ... \n",
      "SOKKA: Well, we have other things to worry about. Aunt Wu was wrong about the volcano. \n",
      "KATARA: [Slightly irked, raises finger accusingly.] Sokka, you tried to convince me she was wrong before. It's going to take an awful lot to change my mind - \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Her eyes widen in surprise, and she lurches forward as an explosion is heard and the volcano rumbles violently. Cuts to shot of the entire group, who is slightly shaken. Cuts to shot of her and Aang looking up at the volcano, both their backs turned, gray smoke is emitting from the peak of the mountain. \n",

      "VILLAGE.WOMAN: [Not buying his claim.] Yeah, yeah, we know you don't believe in Aunt Wu, Mr. science and reason lover. \n",
      "KATARA: [Stepping forward.] If you won't listen to him, maybe you'll listen to me. I want to believe Aunt Wu and her predictions as much as you do, but my brother and Aang saw the lava with their own eyes. \n",
      "CALM.MAN: [Unmoved.] Well, I heard Aunt Wu's prediction with my own ears. \n",
      "AANG: [Leaps onto the awning of a nearby building; urgently.] Please listen to us! You are all in danger! And we have to get out of here! You can't rely on Aunt Wu's prediction, [Cuts to shot of villagers who gaze up at him, seemingly listening.] you have to take fate into your own hands! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Another explosion is heard from the volcano. The villagers seem mildly alarmed. \n",
      "SOKKA: Look! [Points to the volcano.] Can your fortune telling explain that? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of the volcano, smoke rising from the top in great plumes. \n",
      "MAN.WITH.RED.SHOES: [Amused.] Can your science explain why it rains? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Turns to him; yells angrily.] Yes! Yes, it can! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to overhead shot of the courtyard as the villagers walk away, oblivious to the danger. Cuts to shot of Katara and Sokka. \n",
      "KATARA: [Dismayed.] They just won't listen to reason. [Aang leaps down from the awning.] \n",
      "AANG: [Brightening.] But they will listen to Aunt Wu! \n",
      "SOKKA: I know that's the problem. \n",
      "AANG: Well, it's about to become the solution. We're taking fate in our own hands. First, I need to borrow Aunt Wu's cloud reading book. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to Sokka and Katara, who stand in front of Aunt Wu's building, trying to act casual. Sokka flashes an innocent smile. The camera pans upward to the top of the building. Aang appears over the rooftop, along with Momo, and and climbs downward onto the porch of the highest story. Cuts to overhead shot of Aunt Wu's chamber. Cuts to shot of one corner of the room, where Aang is peering in various drawers for the book. Momo chirps. \n",
      "AANG: [Whispering.] Shhh! We don't want anyone to hear us. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of him as he continues to snoop about, his back facing the camera. Meng's reflection appears in the mirror hanging over the dresser. Aang sees this reflection and turns around, startled. He stands up straight, Momo hiding behind his back. \n",
      "AANG: Oh, I didn't see you there. \n",
      "MENG: [Sadly.] You don't like me, do you? [Her ears droop down.] \n",
      "AANG: Of course I like you. \n",
      "MENG: [Downcast.] But not the way I like you. \n",
      "AANG: Oh, I guess not. \n",
      "MENG: It's okay. It's just really hard when you like someone, but they don't think of you that way. \n",
      "AANG: [Casting sad glance to the side.] I know what you mean. \n",
      "MENG: [Off-camera.] She's beautiful, by the way. \n",
      "AANG: [Blushes and looks at her, surprised.] Huh? \n",
      "MENG: [Cuts to shot of the two standing in the room.] That Water Tribe girl. I can see why you like her so much. [Clasps hands together, counts on her fingers.] She's sweet, she's a bender [Cuts to shot of Meng.] and her hair seems so manageable. [While saying this last part, she tries to smooth down her braids only for them to immediately stick up again.] \n",
      "AANG: Don't worry. You're going to meet a great guy who's going to completely fall for you. I know it. [Places a hand on her shoulder comfortingly; turns to leave.] \n",
      "MENG: Thanks. [Holds up hand in alert.] Wait! Don't you want this? [Aang looks surprised; Meng hands him the cloud reading book, revealing she had had it in her possession the whole time.] \n",
      "AANG: How did you know? \n",
      "MENG: [Nervously playing with her fingers.] I've kind of been stalking you. [Smiles sheepishly.] Heh ... \n",
      "AANG: [Blushing.] Oh, thanks ... I guess. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot to shot of Appa flying through the clouds with Aang and Katara on his back, Aang at the reins, Katara seated in his saddle. \n",
      "AANG: Clouds are made of water and air, so between the two of us, we ought to be able to bend them into any shape we want. \n",
      "KATARA: [Reading Aunt Wu's book.] I found it. The symbol for volcanic doom. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She turns the book around, but keeps her hand placed on the image for volcanic doom, obscuring the person's view of the symbol. A cloud passes over the screen, signaling the change of scene. The cloud cover clears, depicting both Aang and Katara standing on Appa's saddle. In synchronization, they raise their arms upward, preparing to shape the clouds. Cuts to shot of Appa sailing through the sky; he leans over on his side and sprawls out his legs, dipping into the clouds below. Cuts to shot of the villagers below, viewing the changing cloud formations. Cuts to shot of the clouds; Appa appears from beneath one of the clouds and flies upward, Aang and Katara seen mounted on his saddle. The bison emerges from the top of a cloud. Cuts to Katara, who swivels around, a smile spread across her face. Cuts to Aang, who swings his arms in a circular motion, using airbending to shape the formation. Cuts to shot of Appa flying in the sky that is now rapidly changing. Below, the villagers look up to see the clouds shifting. Sokka brings Aunt Wu over to her stage. He points to the sky. \n",
      "SOKKA: Aunt Wu, look! Something is happening in the clouds. \n",
      "WU: [Quizzically.] That's very strange. It shouldn't ... [A shadow falls over her face as the sky darkens; suddenly terrified.] Oh my! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a view of the new skull-shaped cloud that Aang and Katara formed. Cut to a view of a mountain spewing smoke into the air. The screen pans down to the village before cutting to a shot where Aang is addressing the crowds. \n",
      "AANG: We still can save the village if we act fast. [Gesturing toward Sokka, who stands on the pagoda.] Sokka has a plan. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Making motions with his arm.] Lava is gonna flow downhill to this spot. If we can dig a deep enough trench we can channel all the lava away from the village to the river. \n",
      "AANG: If any of you are earthbenders, come with me. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the Twins from earlier in the episode. \n",
      "POI: [Raising hand.] I'm an earthbender! \n",
      "PING: [Raising hand.] I'm not! \n",
      "SOKKA: Everybody else grab a shovel [As another explosion resonates over the village, everyone stumbles before regaining balance.] Come on! We've gotta hurry! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The crowd disperses very fast, now desperate to put Sokka's plan into action. A few cries of urgency are uttered. Cut to overhead shot of the ground outside the town during twilight, a deep trench is beginning to form. Team Avatar and the town's people labor to dig the trench, using both earthbending and manual means. Cuts to shot of two earthbenders, who make motions with their arms and legs. Cuts to overhead shot of a portion of the trench as two large boulders are cleared out of the way. Cuts to shot from inside the trench as villagers continue their labor; Appa is seen transporting loose boulders from the scene, using a net attached to his body. Another explosion makes a cut to the mountain again, now lava is spewing out. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Resuming work.] Dig faster! Dig faster! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As lava begins to flow down the volcano in the background, the shot cuts to Poi as he runs and sweeps his arms forward. Cuts to overhead shot of the trench, the bank of the river lying just ahead. A torrent of boulders is cleared and sent down the river as Poi creates a channel toward the river. Cuts to shot of the villagers standing inside the trench. Aang leaps onto the edge of the trench. In the background, the lava steadily creeps further down the mountain toward the village. \n",
      "AANG: Everyone needs to evacuate! We'll come for you when it's safe! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Everyone runs. Momo arrives and puts a small rock on the edge of the trench and lands on Aang, who pets him before also running away from the edge. Cut to the volcano as lava is erupting from its peak. A stream of stream of the burning liquid is coursing down the mountain and into the forest. The scene cuts to Aang, Sokka, and Katara; their faces illuminated by the approaching lava as they watch anxiously, ash falling down upon them. The scene switches to a view of the village gate. An eerie reddish light emerges from the forest with its source, the approaching lava, close behind. As it passes the gate, the burning substance causes the structure to catch fire and crumble down. Unwavering and all-consuming, the lava continuous its descent through the cemetery, destroying several headstones as it passes. Reaching the trench, the lava falls in the ditch, though the steady incoming river of lava quickly threatens to overflow the trench. Cut to the group on the safe side of the trench. \n",
      "KATARA: It's too much! It's gonna overflow! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Another explosion rocks the village. Cut to the volcano, where a huge column of lava and smoke explodes out of the peak. Burning rocks begin to rain down in addition to the ash. Katara and Sokka begin to run for safety but turn to see Aang has not moved. A huge boulder falls out of the sky and lands in the trench, throwing up a fountain of lava. A massive wave of lava begins to head toward the village. Cut to Aang, who is rushing forward with a furious face. He propels himself into the air and begins to airbend. As the lava begins to overflow, Aang blows the lava straight up, not allowing it to advance on the village. Finally, he draws in a mighty intake of breath and expels it, airbending it as it exits, cooling all the lava to stone. Aang relaxes and assumes a meditation pose. Cut to Katara and Sokka watching in surprise, their backs to the camera. \n",
      "SOKKA: Man, sometimes I forget what a powerful bender that kid is. [Katara's expression changes at this, remembering Aunt Wu's words about her future marriage.] \n",
      "KATARA: Wait, what did you just say? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Casually.] Nothing, just that Aang is one powerful bender. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Katara's and Sokka's view of Aang and back to shot of Katara. \n",
      "KATARA: [Slowly widens her eyes in realization; as if having an epiphany.] I suppose he is. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to the volcano, smoking, but no longer erupting. Cuts to a view of the square where Aunt Wu and the town's people, including the Calm man, have assembled. A tall, jagged wall-like formation of cooled lava towers over the square. Aang stands in front of Aunt Wu, offering her back the cloud book he took. \n",
      "AANG: [Sheepishly.] By the way, we kind of borrowed your book. \n",
      "WU: So you messed with the clouds, did you? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Wu grabs the book in anger while Katara looks guilty and Sokka smiles and points at her, indicating that she had a part in the cloud manipulation, too. \n",
      "WU: [Laughs in amusement.] Very clever! \n",
      "SOKKA: No offense, but I hope this taught everyone a lesson about not relying too much on fortune telling. \n",
      "CALM.MAN: [Cheerfully.] But Aunt Wu predicted the village wouldn't be destroyed and it wasn't. She was right, after all. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Gets near the Calm man's face, through gritted teeth.] I hate you. \n",
      "KATARA: [Holding Sokka by the shoulders and leading him away.] It's okay, Sokka. Everything's going to be all right. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to a shot of Aang and Wu. \n",
      "AANG: Can I ask you something? \n",
      "WU: Of course, honey. \n",
      "AANG: [Disappointed.] You didn't really see love in my fortune, did you? You just told me what I wanted to hear. \n",
      "WU: I'll tell you a little secret, young airbender. [Gestures to the sky.] Just as you reshaped those clouds, [Cuts to shot of Aang, who smiles; off-camera.] you have the power to shape your own destiny. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang smiles. Cut to shot of Appa and Team Avatar. Meng stands in front of Appa. Aang airbends himself onto Appa's saddles; Katara is at the reins. \n",
      "KATARA: [Brightly.] Goodbye everyone! It was so nice to meet you! [To Meng.] Take care, Meng. \n",
      "MENG: [Waving.] Take care! [Appa turns away. Cuts to Meng's face, whose smile disappears and is replaced by a frown.] Floozy. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fades to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens up to a body of water, waves crashing against the rocks. The camera cuts to grass and sticks, before slowly panning up to reveal a whale tooth scimitar standing upright in the ground. Aang's hand comes into view as he grasps the weapon's hilt and yanks it out of the ground. Cut to a shot of him holding it up while Sokka slides down a dirt slope. \n",
      "AANG: Hey, look! [Examines the sword.] A sword made out of a whale's tooth. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: While Aang draws the weapon free from the ground, Sokka slides down the slope and pulls up behind the Avatar, snatching the weapon from his hands as Aang turned to show it to him. \n",
      "SOKKA: Let me see that. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka walks on for a little while, before he stops, not too far from Aang, to study the weapon closely. Cut to a shot of the scimitar in his hand. The scene switches into a flashback; Southern Water Tribe warriors are preparing their ships, loading them with supplies. The camera pans to the left as a warrior walks past, carrying a bundle, revealing that a younger Sokka is observing them, his back to the camera. Cuts to frontal shot of him as he looks at the scene wistfully, cradling his battle club. Flashback fades to present-day, where Sokka bears the same wistful expression while holding the whale's tooth scimitar in the same way as his club. \n",
      "SOKKA: This is a Water Tribe weapon. [Turns to Aang, his expression serious.] See if you can find anything else. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of Aang and Sokka searching the wooded area for more weapons. Katara walks toward them, curious. \n",
      "KATARA: [Curiously.] Did someone lose something? \n",
      "AANG: [Rummaging through the bushes; somewhat cheerfully.] No, we found something! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to shot of a spearhead lying on the ground beneath a few fallen leaves. Sokka kneels before it, brushes aside the debris and picks up the spearhead, examining it and running his fingers along its point, noticing ash on it. \n",
      "SOKKA: It's burned. [Cut to shot of a tree trunk, scorch marks and sharp cuts running across its bark. Cut to shot of Sokka and the others.] There was a battle! Water Tribe warriors ambushed a group of firebenders. [He turns away from the tree and looking down the slope of the hill seeing a black spot on the ground.] The firebenders fought back, but the warriors drove them down this hill. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to shot of Sokka racing down the hill along a dirt path, the camera panning downward. He leaps over a few large rocks in his way and continues forward. Cuts to shot of a sandy beach. Sokka appears on screen followed closely by Aang and Katara. \n",
      "AANG: [Intrigued.] So, then what happened? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Disappointed.] I don't know. The trail ends here. \n",
      "KATARA: [Pointing at something in the distance.] Wait, look! [Cut to shot of a Water Tribe ship, half obscured behind large rocks, sitting idly on the shore.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Happily.] It's one of our boats! \n",
      "KATARA: Is this dad's boat? [She and Sokka run toward it. Cut to shot of entire ship as they approach.] \n",
      "SOKKA: No, but it's from his fleet. [Strokes the boat off, while Aang appears behind them.] Dad was here. [Turns to Katara.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to a close-up of Iroh sipping a cup of tea, with a relaxed expression on his face. \n",
      "IROH: [Exhaling.] Aahh! [Cuts to shot of entire room where he and Zuko are seated at a low-lying table.] See Prince Zuko, a moment of quiet is good for your mental well-being. [Pours Zuko a cup of tea.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko raises the cup to take a sip, but the ship suddenly jerks; the vibrations cause the tea in the cup to go flying, soaking Zuko's face and hair. Zuko grunts in frustration, pushes his ponytail back, and rises to see what the commotion is about. Cut to the deck of the ship, several firebenders stand poised, ready to attack. A large beast, called a shirshu, suddenly leaps onto the deck, a young woman mounted on its back. The firebenders flee from the beast. Cuts to closer-up shot of the woman, who slows down the beast's progress. \n",
      "FIREBENDERS: Look out! Argh! \n",
      "JUNE: [Holding a rolled up whip.] Get back! We're after a stowaway! [Cut to overhead shot of the ship's deck.] \n",
      "ZUKO: [Arrives with Iroh.] There are no stowaways on my ship. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of Nyla, the shirshu, who tears off a chunk of the metal deck flooring and hurls it in Zuko's direction. Alarmed, the prince ducks for cover, the firebenders and Iroh move to the side, and the metal piece hits the doorway leading to the main compartments of the ship with a clang as they turn around to watch it hit the door. Zuko looks on in frustration while the firebenders and Iroh take a firebending stance.\n",
      "Cut to shot of the interior of the ship, a gaping hole present where the metal flooring once was. Nyla sticks his head inside and begins sniffing around. Cut to shot from his point of view, the scenery slightly warped and in black-and-white to reflect how he envisions things. A stream of green is visible, drifting through the air. The camera pans right and left as the beast surveys the entire room. It focuses on a single barrel which topples over, revealing that a strange man has been hiding in there. Cut to a shot above the deck where Nyla raises his head out of the hole. The stowaway appears, dashing away from the scene. Nyla shoots forward in hot pursuit of him. Cut to side-view of the man trying to flee; Nyla appears on-camera and lashes out his elongated tongue. Close-up of the tongue striking the man who falls onto the deck, paralyzed, and with a terrified look on his face. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Shocked.] He's paralyzed. \n",
      "JUNE: Only temporarily. [Lifts the man and slings him over her shoulder.] The toxins will wear off in about an hour. But by then, he'll be in jail and I'll have my money. [Walks to Nyla.] \n",
      "ZUKO: But how did you find him on my ship? \n",
      "JUNE: [Prepares to mount Nyla, the stowaway already slung onto his back.] My shirshu can smell a rat a continent away. [Mounts her shirshu.] \n",
      "IROH: Well, I'm impressed. [June cracks her whip. Cuts to shot of the shirshu bolting off the ship and racing down the dock.] Very impressed. [Leaning over the ledge of the ship with Zuko, stroking his beard thoughtfully; Zuko look at him, disgusted.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to that night, the camera panning downward to show that Team Avatar has settled down for the night beside the Water Tribe ship. Cut to shot of Appa. Aang and Momo are lying on his right paw, all three fast asleep. The camera pans left, showing Katara having also drifted off in her sleeping bag. Sokka remains awake, poking a stick into a blazing campfire, looking worried. Cut to side-shot of him; the scene fades to the flashback seen earlier. A younger Sokka is seen walking by, carrying a large bundle in his arms, wearing face-paint. Cut to a shot of Hakoda standing beside a ship, having handed a bundle to a man in the ship. He turns and walks forward. Cut to a shot of Sokka who has halted in his tracks, his father approaching him and standing before his son. \n",

      "SOKKA: [Desperately.] I'm strong, I'm brave, I can fight! Please, Dad! \n",
      "HAKODA: [Lays a hand on his son's shoulder; grimly and sadly.] Being a man is knowing where you're needed the most. And for you right now, that's here, protecting your sister. \n",
      "SOKKA: I don't understand. [His eyes glisten.] \n",
      "HAKODA: Someday you will. [Sokka throws aside his bag and throws himself into his father's arms. Cut to close-up of him as he sobs and buries his face in his father's parka.] I'm gonna miss you so much. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene fades back to present day, Sokka still looking sullenly into the fire. Suddenly a strange noise can be heard, its source originating from somewhere off-camera. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Alert.] Who's there? [Stands up, boomerang in hand.] \n",

      "SOKKA: Where's Dad? \n",
      "KATARA: Is he here? \n",
      "BATO: No, he and the other warriors should be in the Eastern Earth Kingdom by now. [Both siblings look crestfallen at this news. A gust of wind blows, causing them to shiver. Cut to a shot of Bato who shivers as well.] This is no place for a reunion. Let's get inside. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He turns and slings his arms around Sokka and Katara, leading them away. After a moment, he looks back at Aang and gestures for him to follow. Cut to an overhead shot of the shore, the campsite in the distance, as the group begins walking away. The scene cuts to a different location altogether, the moon hanging in a purplish-blue night sky. The camera pans downward to show the roof over of the entrance to an open courtyard. Cut to a shot inside the courtyard, a few nuns milling about, Appa and the group approaching. \n",
      "BATO: After I was wounded, your father carried me to this abbey. The sisters have cared for me ever since. Superior, [A woman turns around.] these are Hakoda's children. They've been traveling with the Avatar. I found them by my boat. \n",
      "MOTHER.SUPERIOR: Young Avatar, it gives me great joy to be in your presence. Welcome to our abbey. \n",
      "AANG: Thank you, it's truly an honor to be here. If there's anything- [Sokka abruptly cuts him off.] \n",
      "SOKKA: What smells so good, Bato? \n",
      "BATO: [Sniffs.] The sisters craft ointments and perfumes. \n",
      "SOKKA: Perfume? [Pointing his thumbs at Appa.] Maybe we can dump some on Appa, because he stinks so much. [Waves his hand in front of his face.] Am I right? [Everyone is silent, a single person coughs.] \n",
      "BATO: You have your father's wit. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to the hut in which Bato is staying, with a tent on the opposite side of the door being the bed chamber, a fire with cousins in the middle, and various pelts placed and hung everywhere. \n",

      "AANG: [Sokka and Katara are slurping their stewed sea prunes as Aang speaks.] Hey, I ride animals, too! There was this one time when I rode a giant eel and I- \n",

Please put that down, [Aang is shown wearing a fur pelt on his head.] it's ceremonial and very fragile. [Aang puts the pelt back on the wall, and sits in the back of the room.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Was it you or Dad that put an octopus on your head and convinced Gran-Gran you were a water spirit? \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang curiously unravels at the message, finding that it is actually a map. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang quickly takes some bites of sea prunes, but chokes them back up, yet he pretends to enjoy them. Katara, Bato, and Sokka look at him strangely. The scene changes to the herbalist's home that Aang visited to find a cure to Katara and Sokka's sickness in the past. Nyla growl can be heard, to which Miyuki hisses. The herbalist turns around to find Nyla, June, Zuko, and Iroh. \n",

      "SOKKA: [To Bato.] Is this the boat he took you ice dodging in? \n",
      "BATO: Yep! It's got the scar to prove it. Ha. How 'bout you Sokka? You must have some good stories from your first time ice dodging. [Sokka begins to look saddened.] \n",
      "KATARA: He never got to go. Dad left before he was old enough. \n",
      "BATO: Oh, I forgot you were too young. \n",
      "AANG: What's ice dodging? \n",
      "BATO: It's a rite of passage for young Water Tribe members. When you turn fourteen, your dad takes you- [Bato smile and puts his hand on Sokka's shoulder with a new thought.] You know what, you're about to find out! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: June, Zuko, and Iroh followed Katara's trail to the Makapu Village. As citizens flee from Nyla in terror, he stops in front of Aunt Wu's shop. Wu remains outside her shop, completely calm. \n",

      "BATO: Ice dodging is a ceremonial test of wisdom, bravery, and trust. [Shot changes to on the boat.] In our village, ice dodging was done by weaving a boat through a field of icebergs. \n",
      "SOKKA: How are we supposed to ice dodge without ice? \n",
      "BATO: You'll be dodging those. [Points to a group of tall, sharp, jagged rocks near the shore. Katara and Sokka appear nervous.] Sokka, you steer and call the shots, lead wisely. Katara, you secure the main sail. [Katara grabs a rope.] The winds can be brutal, so be brave. Aang, you control the jib. Without your steady hand, we all go down. Your position is about trust. \n",
      "AANG: [Blinks. Defensively.] I know that. Why wouldn't I know that? [Folds his arms.] I'm the Avatar; I know about trust. [He crosses his arms and looks away, but gives Bato a second glance.] \n",
      "BATO: For this is to be done right, I cannot help. [Sits cross-legged at the front of the boat.] You pass or fail on your own. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Studies the rocky shores.] Aang, ease up on the jib. Katara, steady. [Katara looks at the shore with concern.] Aang, less sail. Katara, give him room. [The ship moves to the side and sails between some rocks.] Aang, helm to lee. Helm to lee! \n",
      "AANG: What does that even mean? \n",

      "KATARA: There's no way through! \n",
      "SOKKA: We can make it. \n",
      "BATO: [Stands up and grabs the side of the boat.] Sokka, you've already proven yourself. Maybe we should- \n",
      "SOKKA: Aang, I'm gonna need air in that sail. [Aang nods.] Katara, I want you to bend as much water as you can between us and those rocks. Now! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara bends the water below the boat while Aang fires airbending blasts at the sail. Sokka groans nervously as the boat clears the rocks. When they reach clear water, Sokka sighs and relaxes. The rest of the group smiles at him. Fade to an aerial shot of Bato's boat beached on the shore. Shot changes to Bato carrying a small cup of purple paint. \n",
      "BATO: [Dips his fingers in the paint.] The spirits of water bear witness to these marks. For Sokka, the Mark of the Wise. [Uses his thumb to put an arc and small dot on Sokka's forehead.] The same mark your father earned. For Katara, [Uses his thumb to put a crescent moon mark on Katara's forehead.] the Mark of the Brave. Your courage inspires us. [Using his thumb to put an arc on Aang's forehead.] And for Aang, the Mark of the Trusted. You are now an honorary member of the Water Tribe. \n",
      "AANG: I can't. [Looks down.] \n",
      "KATARA: Of course you can! \n",
      "AANG: [Rubbing off his mark and backing away.] No, you can't trust me. \n",
      "KATARA: [Concerned.] Aang, what are you talking about? \n",
      "AANG: [Takes the crumpled map out of his sleeve.] A messenger gave this to me for Bato. [Katara takes it from him.] You have to understand. I was afraid you would- \n",
      "SOKKA: [Angrily.] This is the map to our father! You had it the whole time? How could you? [Aang shrugs his shoulders.] Well, you can go to the North Pole on your own. I'm going to find Dad. [Walks away.] \n",
      "BATO: Well, Sokka. I think you should- \n",
      "SOKKA: [Turns back.] Katara, are you with me? \n",

      "KATARA: [To Sokka.] That wolf sounds so sad. \n",
      "SOKKA: It's probably wounded. \n",
      "BATO: [Turns back to them.] No, it's been separated from the pack. I understand that pain. It's how I felt when the Water Tribe warriors had to leave me behind. They were my family, [Shot of Sokka, who looks sadly at the camera.] and being apart from them was more painful than my wounds. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to another one of Sokka's flashbacks. The young Sokka stands at the end of an ice pier as eight ships travel away, fading into the fog. Frontal shot of the young Sokka fades to Sokka wearing a similar expression from the flashback as he stares at the camera. \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka? \n",
      "SOKKA: We need to go back. I wanna see Dad, but, helping Aang is where we're needed the most. \n",
      "KATARA: [Smiles.] You're right. \n",
      "BATO: [Walks up to Katara and Sokka and puts his arms on their shoulders.] Your father will understand, and I know he's proud of you. \n",
      "SOKKA: Thanks, Bato. \n",

Katara removes Sokka's mask, revealing him to be frowning, and Aang's mask, revealing him to be the one smiling. She places Sokka's original mask over Aang's face and Aang's over Sokka. \n",
      "AANG: Hey, there's some food. \n",
      "SOKKA: Finally! [To the shop keeper.] What do you have? \n",
      "SHOP.KEEPER: Flaming fire flakes! Best in town. \n",
      "SOKKA: I'll take'em! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka gobbles down the fire flakes, but has a spasm from the spiciness. \n",
      "SOKKA: Aaahhh! Hot! Hot! \n",
      "KATARA: [Sarcastically.] \"Flaming fire flakes\", hot? What do you know? \n",
      "AANG: Hey, look at this. \n",
      "PUPPET.FIRE.LORD: Don't worry loyal citizens! No one can surprise the Fire Lord! \n",
      "FIRE.NATION.KIDS: [As an Earth Kingdom general puppet pops up behind the Fire Lord's puppet, with a rock ready to attack.] Oh no! Look out! [The puppet breaths fire, burning the other puppet.] \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, hold on! Where are we going? \n",
      "AANG: I don't know, but there's a big crowd so it must be good. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sarcastically.] Knowing the Fire Nation, it's probably an execution. \n",
      "AANG: I gotta learn that trick! \n",
      "MALU: Thank you! For my next trick I need a volunteer from the audience! \n",
      "AANG: [Waving his hand up in the air all around childishly.] Oh! Oh! Me! Me! \n",
      "SOKKA: [In a stern tone while pulling his arm down.] What do you think you're doing? \n",
      "AANG: I want to get a closer look. \n",
      "KATARA: It's better that we don't attract any attention to ourselves. \n",
      "MALU: How about you, little lady? \n",
      "KATARA: [While backing away.] Uh. \n",
      "MALU: Awww, she's shy. Leeet's give her some encouragement, folks! \n",
      "AANG: [In a jealous tone while folding his arms.] Awww! That could've been me. \n",
      "MALU: This next trick is called \"Taming the Dragon.\" [While sitting her down in a chair and tying her to it.] You will be my captured princess! Don't worry, young maiden! I will tame this fiery beast! It's too strong, I can't hold it! \n",
      "AANG: We gotta help her! \n",
      "SOKKA: No, we don't want to make a scene! \n",
      "MALU: The rope, it's breaking! [Aang saves Katara with his airbending, dispersing the flames is a ray of colors while he loses his mask in the process.] Hey, you tryin' to upstage me, kid? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang starts doing a goofy dance as everyone boos at him for ruining the trick. \n",
      "CITIZEN: Hey! That kid's the Avatar! [Aang stops dancing and runs.] \n",
      "SOKKA: I think it's time to go. \n",
      "CHEY: Follow me! I can get you outta here! [The kids follow Chey.] \n",
      "GUARD: There they are! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Chey throws a series of explosives at the Fire Nation soldiers that are chasing them. \n",
      "GUARD: Over there! \n",
      "AANG: I'm calling Appa. [Aang blows his whistle.] \n",
      "SOKKA: I hope he can really hear that bison whistle! \n",
      "CHEY: [Making a sharp turn down one of the several alleys.] This way! [Comes running back.] Okay! Not this way! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They make another turn, but the way they came is blocked by guards. Chey throws another smoke bomb and runs past them into another alley. They group comes across another dead end where there is an enormous supply of fireworks. Cut to an overhead shot that reveals Appa has arrived in the nick of time. \n",
      "AANG: Appa! Down here! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa lands between the kids and the guards, with his backside facing the guards. Appa airbends a gale force wind which results in the guards getting blown out of sight. As the guards run back into the alley, Appa has already taken off. Cut to Chey, he bites the top off a bomb to light it. He throws it at the fireworks supply and it blows up creating a beautiful display of fireworks. Cut to Chey removing his hood as they cruise away. \n",
      "AANG: Nice touch setting off the fireworks. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Impressed.] You really know your explosives ... \n",
      "CHEY: I'm familiar. \n",
      "SOKKA: You're a Fire Nation Soldier! \n",
      "CHEY: Was. My name's Chey. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The group lands and makes camp. \n",
      "CHEY: I serve a man. More than a man really, he's a myth, but he's real, a living legend, Jeong Jeong the Deserter. He was a Fire Nation general, or wait, was he an admiral? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Not amused.] He was very highly ranked, we get it. \n",
      "CHEY: Yeah! Way up there! But he couldn't take the madness any more. He's the first person ever to leave the army - and live. I'm the second, but you don't get to be a legend for that. That's okay though. Jeong Jeong's a firebending genius. Some say he's mad - but he's not! He's enlightened. \n",
      "AANG: You mean there's a firebender out here who's not with the Fire Lord? [Gets up in excitement.] We've gotta go see him! He can train me! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Snaps at Aang.] We're not gonna go find some crazy firebender! \n",
      "CHEY: [Annoyed; Stands up to gesture.] He's not crazy! He's a genius! And he's the perfect person to train the Avatar! That's why I followed you into the festival. \n",
      "SOKKA: Look, thanks for the help, but we're leaving for the North Pole in the morning. \n",
      "AANG: Sokka, this could be my only chance to meet a firebending master who would actually be willing to teach me. \n",
      "KATARA: It can't hurt just to talk to him. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Very annoyed.] That's what you said about going to the festival! Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As Sokka turns to pout, he almost runs right into a spear. In a flash, they are surrounded by men wearing straw hats, light armor, wearing tribal make up, and wielding spears. \n",
      "LIN.YEE: Don't move! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The tribal folks escort them to their settlement. \n",
      "LIN.YEE: [Angry.] Jeong Jeong told you not to look for Avatar! \n",
      "SOKKA: Hold on, you know these guys? \n",
      "CHEY: Oh yeh! Lin Yee's an old buddy! Right, Lin Yee? \n",
      "LIN.YEE: [Not amused with Chey.] Shut up! Keep moving. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Down the hill, there is a little cottage with leaves and logs. \n",
      "LIN.YEE: Go on. He sees you only. \n",
      "CHEY: Oh that's okay, we can chat later. \n",
      "AANG: Is that where Jeong Jeong is? I need to talk to him right away. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang tries to move forward, but it stopped by a spear shaft. \n",
      "LIN.YEE: No! You wait there. [Pushes Chey forward.] Go now! \n",
      "CHEY: Don't worry! Everything'll be fine. He's a great man, great man! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Chey walks toward Jeong Jeong's cottage. Back in the Fire Days Festival in the now deserted central square of the town where some guards are being interrogated by Admiral Zhao who is accompanied by a few guards himself. \n",
      "ZHAO: So, the Avatar was here and you let him slip away? \n",
      "GUARD.CAPTAIN: [Anxiously.] Yes, sir, but other than that the festival went off without a hitch! [A huge piece of burning planks of wood falls in the background with a massive crash making the guards twitch.] No fights. Theft was way down. \n",
      "ZHAO: [Irritated.] I don't care about your local crime rates! Which way did they go? \n",
      "GUARD.CAPTAIN: They headed into the forest, up the river I suspect. \n",
      "ZHAO: Ready the river boats. We're going after the Avatar. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back in the settlement, Chey exits Jeong Jeong's cottage. He arrives back where Aang and the others are fast asleep. Everyone wakes up instantly as Chey approaches. \n",
      "AANG: What happened? Can I see Jeong Jeong now? \n",
      "CHEY: [Looking downcast.] He won't see you. He's very angry that I brought you here. He wants you to leave immediately. \n",
      "SOKKA: Finally! Let's hit the road. [He stretches back out again.] \n",
      "AANG: Why won't he see me? \n",
      "CHEY: He says you're not ready. Says you haven't mastered waterbending and earthbending yet. \n",
      "AANG: [Shocked.] Wait, how does he know that? \n",
      "CHEY: He saw the way you walked into camp. He could tell. \n",
      "AANG: I'm going in, anyway! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang walks to Jeong Jeong's cottage. He takes a deep breath, parts the curtain, and walks into the darkness. Cut to a dark figure seated cross legged amidst a semicircle of candles, his back to Aang. \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: Get out. \n",
      "AANG: Master, I need to learn firebending. \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: Only a fool seeks his own destruction. \n",
      "AANG: [To Jeong Jeong.] I'm the Avatar, it's my destiny to— [Gets interrupted.] \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: Destiny? What would a boy know of destiny? If a fish lives its whole life in this river, does he know the river's destiny? No! Only that it runs on and on out of his control! He may follow where it flows, but he cannot see the end. He cannot imagine the ocean. \n",
      "AANG: Okay, but it's the Avatar's duty to master all of the bending disciplines. \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: To master the bending disciplines, you must first master discipline itself. But you have no interest in this, so I have no interest in you! Now, get out. \n",
      "AANG: Please, I have to learn. This could be my only chance. \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: Are you deaf? How can I teach you if you refuse to listen? Before learning firebending you must learn water and earth. Water is cool and soothing, earth is steady and stable, but fire, fire is alive! It breathes, it grows. Without the bender, a rock will not throw itself! But fire will spread and destroy everything in its path if one does not have the will to control it! That is its destiny! You are not ready! You are too weak! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: At this final gesture the candles around Jeong Jeong violently flame up to illuminate the entire hut before quickly going out. A vision in front of Jeong Jeong begins, as one candle is seen lit in front of the firebender. A tree is in the background behind the Deserter. In front of him, stands Avatar Roku. \n",
      "ROKU: You think I am weak? \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: Avatar Roku! No, No! I did not mean that. \n",
      "ROKU: I have mastered the elements a thousand times in a thousand lifetimes. Now, I must do it once again. You will teach the Avatar [He raises his hand and ignites the tree behind Jeong Jeong.] firebending. \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: Yes, yes, I will teach you. \n",
      "AANG: Really? That's great! [Raises his hands happily; Jeong Jeong groans in dismay fearing this may not end well.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: In the morning outside of Jeong Jeong's cottage. Sokka is sitting on a boulder by the river, fishing. The screen pans up the river where Katara is practicing waterbending before switching to Aang and Jeong Jeong in front of the cottage. Aang stands, bandy legged, on a flat stone in the river. Jeong Jeong stands a foot or two away on the bank in front of his cottage. \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: Widen your stance. Wider! Bend your knees. Now, concentrate. [Aang expresses his concentration.] Good, good! \n",
      "AANG: Wait! What do I do now? \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: [Turns around.] Silence! Talking is not concentrating! Look at your friend, is she talking? [Points at Sokka.] Even that oaf knows to concentrate on what he's doing! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Annoyed.] Hey! \n",
      "AANG: But what am I concentrating on? \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: Feel the heat of the sun. It is the greatest source of fire. Yet, it is in complete balance with nature! \n",
      "AANG: So when do I get to make some fire? \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: Concentrate! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang breathes and is embarrassed as his friends laugh at him from behind. He turns to look at them, but they stop instantly, as he tries to innocent. Cut to a long shot of the figures in the distance climbing the slope of a mountain. Cut to a close-up shot of Aang and Jeong Jeong walking up the path to the mountain's summit. \n",
      "AANG: Are we coming up here so I don't burn anything with my fire blasts? \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: No fire yet. \n",
      "AANG: What? \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: Power in firebending comes from the breath. That is why you must master proper breath control. \n",
      "AANG: You brought me up here to breathe? \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: Assume your stance. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang assumes the proper stance. \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: [Faces the opposite direction of Aang.] Wider. \n",
      "AANG: You're not even look— [Interrupted by Jeong Jeong.] \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: Wider! Now, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth - without talking. Good. Keep going. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Jeong Jeong walks down the path and out of the frame as Aang continues to breathe, a look of fierce concentration on his face. Cut to a view of Aang's lower body as he parts the curtain into Jeong Jeong's cottage. \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: What are you doing here? I did not tell you to stop! \n",
      "AANG: I've been breathing for hours! \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: You want to stop breathing? \n",
      "AANG: I want you to stop wasting my time! I already know how to squat and breathe and feel the sun! [Wiggles fingers to the ceiling to gesture this.] I wanna know how to shoot fire out of my fingertips! \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: [Sighs gruffly.] I had a pupil once who had no interest in learning discipline. He was only concerned with the power of fire - how he could use it to destroy his opponents and wipe out the obstacles in his path, but fire is a horrible burden to bear. Its nature is to consume and without control it destroys everything around it. [While he was speaking, the camera cuts to Zhao on his boat; several men attack him, but he fends them off easily, leaving a fire in his wake. Cuts back to Jeong Jeong.] \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: Learn restraint, or risk destroying yourself and everything you love. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: After several hours Jeong Jeong finds Aang in front of the hut meditating. \n",
      "AANG: I thought about what you said, I promise I'll be more patient. \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: We're going to work with fire now. \n",
      "AANG: Oh yeah! [Aang gets excited and airbends himself into the air. He quickly gets serious again.] I mean, let us begin. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Jeong Jeong grabs a falling leaf and burns the center. \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: Concentrate on the fire. I want you to keep the flame from reaching the edges of the leaf for as long as you can. \n",
      "TRIBAL.MAN: Master! There is trouble. \n",
      "AANG: What's going on? \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: Concentrate on your leaf! \n",
      "AANG: [Annoyed.] This is the worst firebending instruction ever! All he does is leave me for hours to concentrate or breathe! \n",
      "KATARA: I'm sure there's a good reason. \n",
      "AANG: But I'm ready to do so much more. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang remembers to concentrate on his leaf and gets into a stance and breaths. Moments later, the leaf burns up creating a small flame. \n",
      "AANG: [Excited.] I did it! I made fire! \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, that's great, but you should take it slow. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang starts playing with it by tossing it back and forth from in front to behind himself. He makes a blast go in the opposite direction. \n",
      "AANG: Now that's some firebending! \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, you'll hurt yourself! \n",
      "AANG: I wonder how that juggler did it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang tosses it into the air and spreads his arms out. For a second, he has a smile on his face, but it vanishes as he accidentally burns Katara's hands. Katara shrieks in pain. \n",
      "AANG: Katara! I'm so sorry! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka comes running to Katara's side. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Concerned.] Katara, what's wrong? [Angrily.] What did you do!? \n",
      "AANG: I'm sorry! It was an accident! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka tackles Aang. \n",
      "SOKKA: I told you we shouldn't mess around with this! Look what you did! You burned my sister! [Katara runs away.] You burned my sister! [As Jeong Jeong walks in.] This is all your fault! \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: I know! Now pack your things. You must leave immediately. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara runs off. \n",
      "AANG: I'm sorry, I didn't ... [Sokka runs off.] I'm sorry! [Jeong Jeong looks at Aang, displeased.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to Katara who is sulking by a creek due to the pain of her burns. She dips her hands in; they glow briefly, and a few seconds later her hands are healed. \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: You have healing abilities. The great benders of the Water Tribe sometimes have this ability. I've always wished I were blessed like you - free from this burning curse. \n",
      "KATARA: But you're a great master. You have powers that I will never know. \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: Water brings healing and life. But fire brings only destruction and pain. It forces those of us burdened with its care to walk a razor's edge between humanity and savagery. Eventually, we are torn apart. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Suddenly the water is front of them is blasted with flames. Jeong Jeong gets up and gets into a defensive bending stance and breaks the flames that wash over him and Katara. The screen changes to a frontal shot of Zhao's riverboats coming toward them before switching back to Katara and Jeong Jeong. \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: Go get your friends and flee! Do not come back here or you will all be destroyed. Hurry! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Jeong Jeong faces the boats that land harmlessly around him. The screen shows Zhao looking ahead through a telescope from the main deck of his ship. He lowers it and smiles. The screen goes back to Jeong Jeong produces a large wall of fire in front of the ships. An overhead shot of the ships is shown; the boats turn to land on the beach. The screen goes back to the front of the beach. Zhao comes into view. \n",
      "ZHAO: Don't worry, men. My old teacher gave up fighting a long time ago. [The screen pans to Jeong Jeong. Suddenly, Zhao parts through the wall.] Haven't you, Master Jeong Jeong? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: [The screen goes for a close of Jeong Jeong's face, and a wide shot as he drops the wall of fire. Cut to Katara running up to where Sokka is preparing Appa to leave.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Katara! Are you all right? \n",
      "KATARA: I'm fine, we've got to get out of here. Where's Aang? [Sokka gestures to the cottage.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara enters the cottage to find Aang sulking. \n",
      "AANG: Jeong Jeong tried to tell me that I wasn't ready. I wouldn't listen. I'm never going to firebend again. \n",
      "KATARA: You'll have to eventually. \n",
      "AANG: No, never again. \n",
      "KATARA: It's okay, Aang. I'm healed. \n",
      "AANG: [Surprised.] What? How? \n",
      "KATARA: I'll explain later. But right now, we have to get out here. Zhao and his soldiers are attacking! \n",
      "AANG: [Gets on his feet.] Where? \n",
      "KATARA: By the river. They captured Jeong Jeong. \n",
      "AANG: I have to help him! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: [The screen switches to an overhead shot of the beach. Zhao and his men stand against Jeong Jeong, before cutting to a closer shot.] \n",
      "ZHAO: Look at you. You were once so great. I can't believe my former master has become nothing more than a simple savage. \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: It is you who have embraced savagery, Zhao. \n",
      "ZHAO: It's Admiral Zhao, now. \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: That title will not help you against the Avatar. Do not try to fight him! You are no match! \n",
      "ZHAO: [Amused.] I think I can handle a child. \n",
      "JEONG.JEONG: I have never seen such raw power ... \n",
      "AANG: Jeong Jeong! \n",
      "ZHAO: We'll see. Men! Take the deserter! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to overhead shot of Jeong Jeong surrounded by five firebenders. Aang tops short in horror as they close in. Jeong Jeong smirks and wraps himself in a ball of flames. When the flames completely dissipates Jeong Jeong is nowhere to be seen. \n",
      "ZHAO: [Angry.] It's a trick! He's run off into the woods. Find him! [Faces Aang.] Let's find out what my old master has taught you. \n",
      "AANG: [Shocked.] You were Jeong Jeong's student?! \n",
      "ZHAO: Until I got bored. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zhao throws a fireball at Aang. \n",
      "ZHAO: I see he taught you how to duck and run like a coward. But I doubt he showed you what a firebender is truly capable of! [Throws another intense fireball.] \n",
      "AANG: Whoa! Wild shot! \n",
      "ZHAO: [Roars with rage.] I'll show you wild! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang looks over to the side where Zhao just burned. \n",
      "AANG: No self-control ... [Gets an idea.] \n",
      "ZHAO: Stand and fight, Avatar! \n",
      "AANG: [Mockingly.] Oh, were we fighting? I thought you were just getting warmed up! \n",
      "ZHAO: [Burns in anger at the remark.] I was ... [Shoots another fireball.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zhao fires many more fireballs which all miss. \n",
      "AANG: Is that all you got? Man, they'll make anyone an admiral these days! [Nearly gets blasted.] [Aang cups his hands over his to sound louder.] Ahoy! [Moons Zhao with pants up.] I'm Admiral Zhao! [Zhao gets even angrier and Aang nearly gets blasted again.] I don't know why, but I thought you'd be better than Zuko. [Aang looks disappointed when he says this. His eyes go wide and he lies down on the deck fast enough to avoid being burnt. Mocking Zhao's firebending.] Sloppy. Very sloppy. \n",
      "ZHAO: Nowhere to run now, you little smart mouth! \n",
      "AANG: [Having dodged a series of blasts from Zhao on several ships.] You've lost this battle. \n",
      "ZHAO: [Enraged disbelief.] Are you crazy? You haven't thrown a single blow! \n",
      "AANG: No, but you have. [He gestures around, all the boats are on fire and sinking.] Jeong Jeong said you had no restraint. [Jumps in the water.] Have a nice walk home! \n",
      "SOKKA: Aang, come on! Let's go! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut a shot from behind Aang, who is now looking at the river bank beach. Aang hops on Appa and they fly away. \n",
      "AANG: Wait! Where's Jeong Jeong? \n",
      "SOKKA: He disappeared. They all did. \n",
      "CHEY: [Walks into the now abandoned village; not amused.] Hey, where did everybody go? [Sarcastically.] Very funny guys \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, you're burned! Let me help you. [Katara heals the burn on Aang's arm.] \n",
      "AANG: Wow, that's good water. \n",
      "SOKKA: When did you learn that? \n",
      "KATARA: I guess I always knew. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sarcastically.] Oh ... Well then thanks for all the first aid over the years. Like when I fell into the greaseberry bramble. [Angrily.] Or that time I had two fishhooks in my thumb! \n",
      "AANG: [Shocked.] Two? \n",
      "KATARA: [Amused.] He tried to get the first fishhook out with another fishhook. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Still being sarcastic.] Oh, and the time that mink snake bit me! Thanks for healing that up. That was great. Really helpful. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode begins with the gang sitting around a camp site with several other groups, listening to a man telling a story of 'airbenders'. \n",
      "STORYTELLER: [Dramatically; out of view.] So, travelers. The next time you think you hear a strange, large bird talking, take a closer look. It might not be a giant parrot, but a flying man. A member of a secret group of air walkers, who laugh at gravity, and laugh at those bound to the earth by it! \n",
      "AANG: [Cuts to a wide shot, showing the gang and the other travelers surrounding a small campfire. The Storyteller, having finished his story, is going around collecting coins from the other travelers.] Aren't airbender stories the greatest? [Talking to Katara and Sokka, who are sitting next to him.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Excitedly.] Was it realistic? Is that how it was back then? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to the three kids. \n",
      "AANG: I laugh at gravity all the time. [Chuckling to himself.] Gravity. \n",
      "STORYTELLER: [Arrives in front of the gang, having already collected money from the rest of the audience.] Jingle, jingle! [Jingles the hat in front of Sokka, asking for money.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka searches inside his heavy cloak, and manages to pull out a bug, a worm and a few crumbs. \n",
      "SOKKA: Sorry ... \n",
      "STORYTELLER: [Upset and somewhat downcast.] Aww, cheapskates! [Walks away as Sokka puts the bugs back in his pocket.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang stands up and runs after the storyteller, who is kneeling in front of an old man. \n",
      "AANG: [Happily.] Hey! Thanks for the story. \n",
      "STORYTELLER: [Holds out his cap.] Tell it to the cap, boy. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Storyteller shakes his cap behind him as he kneels in front of an old man. The shaking causes a coin to come loose and fall from the cap. As Aang searches his clothes for some money, Momo picks up the coin and puts it in the cap as the Storyteller turns around. \n",
      "STORYTELLER: Aww, much obliged, little bat-thing. [He pets Momo on the head.] \n",
      "AANG: [Having given up trying to find a coin.] It means a lot to hear airbender stories. It must have been a hundred years ago your great grandpa met them. \n",
      "STORYTELLER: [Confused.] What are you prattling about, child? Great Grandpappy saw the air walkers last week. [He indicates to the old man he was kneeling in front of before. The old man makes a sound in his throat akin to a laugh, and waves a greeting to Aang. The shot cuts to Aang, who has a shocked and disbelieving expression.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes from the campsite to a shot of clouds, and Appa flying above them. \n",
      "AANG: [Sitting on Appa's neck, steering. He is talking to Katara and Sokka, who are riding in Appa's saddle.] Hey, we're almost at the Northern Air Temple. This is where they had the championships for Sky Bison polo. \n",
      "KATARA: [Moving to sit at the back of the saddle with her brother.] Do you think we'll really find airbenders? \n",
      "SOKKA: [He is whittling a piece of wood. The design is indecipherable.] You want me to be like you, or totally honest? \n",
      "KATARA: [Crossing her arms, obviously angry with him.] Are you saying I'm a liar? \n",
      "SOKKA: [He shrugs, unconcerned with her mood.] I'm saying you're an optimist. Same thing, basically. \n",
      "AANG: [Excitedly.] Hey, guys, look at this! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera moves to show Appa, who is flying toward a mountain with a large structure on top. It looks very similar to the Southern Air Temple, with obvious spires reminiscent of a temple's architecture. Around them are several dark specks. The camera zooms in, and the specks are revealed to be people, flying around the temple in plane-shaped contraptions. \n",
      "KATARA: [Amazed.] They really are airbenders! \n",
      "AANG: [His face falls as he sees the 'airbenders', and after Katara's excited outburst, he leans back and scowls while crossing his arms.] No, they're not. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Exuberantly.] What do you mean \"they're not\"? Those guys are flying! \n",
      "AANG: [Bitterly. He is glaring at the direction of the people flying around the temple.] Gliding maybe, but not flying. You can tell by the way they move, they're not airbending. Those people have no spirit. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Suddenly, a boy sitting in an oddly shaped chair flies right above them, nearly hitting them, and laughing as he does so. \n",
      "KATARA: I don't know, Aang.[Katara points to the boy.] That kid seemed pretty spirited. [Katara indicates to the boy, who is flying dangerously close, but still laughing.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The boy begins to fly away, shooting Aang one more look back as he does so while grinning. Aang grins devilishly, and opens up his glider to follow the boy. He leaves Katara and Sokka on Appa, and they quickly become surrounded by gliders as they get closer to the temple. Several gliders almost hit Appa, which causes Katara to knock into her brother and shout in pain as Appa moves sharply to avoid them. \n",
      "SOKKA: We better find some solid ground, before it finds us. [The siblings land Appa on the temple courtyard, out of the hazardous sky. Aang is still flying with the boy, and seems to be having fun at the surprise competition.] \n",
      "COLONISTS: [Several children are on the ground, cheering on their friend.] Go Teo! Show that bald kid how it's done! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Teo and Aang do two loop-de-loops as they fly around the air temple. The two boys do a spiral downwards. \n",
      "TEO: [The boy doesn't seem upset at Aang, and seems happy that he isn't angry for nearly flying into him.] Hey there, you're pretty good! \n",
      "AANG: [Nonchalantly, but with a smirk.] Yeah, I know. But I can do more than fancy gliding. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang begins flying closer to the temple, under a bridge. Cut to a scene of Aang jumping off his glider and allowing it to fly forward on its own. He begins running along a wall, switching to an air scooter halfway, before jumping off onto his glider again. \n",
      "TEO: [He is looking amazed, before thinking of his own plan.] Wow, I don't think I can do that. But here's a good one. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Teo turns on a small canister that is positioned under his glider. White smoke begins to stream from the strange contraption, and Teo flies around in the sky. The camera pans to show the sight from the ground, where it is revealed that he has created an image of Aang's face, complete with an annoyed expression. The crowd below cheers. \n",
      "TEO: What do you think? \n",
      "AANG: [Annoyed; his face mimics the one Teo has just drawn.] It's great. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang lands beside Katara and Sokka. Teo lands soon after and pulls on the brakes. Other children take the glider off of the top of his wheel chair. Teo rolls up to Aang. \n",
      "TEO: Hey, you're a real airbender. You must be the Avatar! That's amazing! I-I've heard stories about you! \n",
      "AANG: [Rubs his head, embarrassed.] Thanks. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sokka ignores all formalities, instead going over to Teo's chair and examining the strange shape and design.] Wow! This glider chair is incredible! \n",
      "TEO: You think this is good, wait until you see the other stuff my dad designed. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: All four walk inside the building. They enter a room filled with pipes and machinery. Aang looks around worriedly. Beneath the pipes, an original mural can be seen, although it has been destroyed by the pipes, which are sticking into the walls. \n",
      "SOKKA: Wow! [Runs up to machines.] \n",
      "TEO: Yeah, my dad is the mastermind behind this whole place. Everything's powered by hot air. [Shows women using an elevator like contraption.] It even pumps hot air currents outside to give us a lift while we're gliding. \n",
      "AANG: [Monotonously.] This place is unbelievable. \n",
      "TEO: Yeah, it's great, isn't it? \n",
      "AANG: No, just unbelievable. [Walks away.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Katara approaches Teo, who seems disappointed at Aang's reaction.] Aang used to come here a long time ago. I think he's a little shocked it's so ... different. \n",
      "SOKKA: So better! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara walks up to Aang, who is looking at a painted wall with pipes going through it. \n",
      "AANG: This is supposed to be the history of my people. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara puts her hand on his shoulder. He walks over to a fountain with an air bison statue on it. He looks at his reflection in the dirty green water, Aang looks at it squeamishly. The sky bison statue suddenly has black smoke coming out of it's mouth. \n",
      "AANG: Ugh! \n",
      "KATARA: [Walks up and puts her hand on his shoulder.] I'm sure some parts of the temple are still the same. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Screen pans off to show Aang, Katara, Sokka and Teo walking across a bridge to a large room that looks well kept. The room has no roof, although around the walls there are statues of monks, mostly meditating. \n",
      "AANG: It's nice to see that at least one part of the temple that isn't ruined. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara and Aang look at a statue of a long-bearded airbender meditating. \n",
      "MAN: [Off-screen.] Look out! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The statue is knocked down by a wrecking ball and all four cover their heads. Dust is coming from the statue, so all four cough. The dust clears to show six men standing where the statue used to be. \n",
      "MECHANIST: What the doodle? Don't you know enough to stay away from construction sites? We have to make room for the bathhouse! [He has approached Aang and the group, looking more surprised than upset.] \n",
      "AANG: [He turns to the mechanist and yells angrily at him.] Do you know what you did!? You just destroyed something sacred! For a stupid bathhouse! \n",
      "MECHANIST: Well, people around here are starting to stink. [Waves his hand in front of his face, as though trying to dissipate a bad smell.] \n",
      "AANG: [Points at the mechanist.] This whole place stinks! [Using his airbending, Aang flips the crane contraption off of the edge of the building.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to exterior shot, showing the crane falling and landing heavily against the side of the cliff the temple is situated on. It is covered by a cloud of dirt and snow as it is utterly destroyed. \n",
      "AANG: This is a sacred temple! You can't treat it this way! [Walks closer to the mechanist.] I've seen it when the monks were here! I know what it's supposed to be like! \n",
      "MECHANIST: The monks? But, [Scratches his beard.] you're twelve. \n",
      "TEO: [Teo rolls up.] Dad, he's the Avatar. He used to come here a hundred years ago. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang takes a menacing step closer to the mechanist, who takes a step back. \n",
      "AANG: What are you doing? Who said you could be here? \n",
      "MECHANIST: [Turns away from Aang.] Hmm, doing here ... A long time ago, [Points finger up.] but not a hundred years, my people became refugees [Walks behind his son's wheelchair.] after a terrible flood. My infant son, [Teo looks down sadly.] Teo, was badly hurt and lost his mother. [Sniffles.] I needed somewhere to rebuild and I stumbled across this place. Couldn't believe it! Everywhere! Pictures of flying people! But empty, [Looks around.] nobody home. Then, [Does a airplane like gesture, like he's flying up to Aang.] I came across these fan-like contraptions! \n",
      "AANG: Our gliders. \n",
      "MECHANIST: Yes! Little, light flying machines! [Waves his hands up and down.] They gave me an idea. Build a new life for my son, in the air! Then everyone will be on equal ground! So to speak. We're just in the process of improving upon what's already here. [Katara wipes her tears on Aang's shirt, and Sokka looks like he's holding back tears.] And, after all, isn't that what nature does? \n",
      "AANG: Nature knows where to stop. \n",
      "MECHANIST: I suppose that's true. Unfortunately, progress has a way of getting away from us. Look at the time! [Points at candles.] Come! [To other workers.] The pulley system must be oiled before dark. \n",
      "SOKKA: Wait, how can you tell the time from that thing? The notches all look the same. \n",
      "MECHANIST: The candle will tell us. Watch. [Candle pops four times.] \n",
      "SOKKA: You put spark powder in the candle! \n",
      "MECHANIST: Four flashes. So it's exactly four hours past mid-day. Or, as I call it: four o'candle. [Sokka laughs. Cut to a frontal shot of the mechanist, pleased that Sokka is interested.] If you like that, wait till you see my finger-safe knife sharpener. [He holds up his left hand, revealing that three of the fingers are made of wood.] Only took me three tries to get it right. [He pulls off the three wooden fingers, and throws them into Sokka's hand.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Horrified.] Aaah! \n",
      "MECHANIST: [Pokes Sokka in the back with his one remaining finger and gestures for him to come.] Follow me! [Sokka runs after him.] \n",
      "TEO: Hey, Aang. I want to show you something. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Screen fades to black before reappearing with Katara, Teo and Aang walking inside a building. \n",
      "AANG: I just can't get over it. There's not a single thing that's the same. \n",
      "TEO: I don't know about that. The temple might be different [Picks up hermit crab from the ground.] but the creatures that live here [Hands it to Katara.] are probably direct descendants of the ones who lived here a long time ago. \n",
      "KATARA: [Pokes hermit crab.] You're right. They're kind of keepers of the temple's origins. [Katara hands it to Aang. It moves around in his hand and he smiles.] \n",
      "TEO: Besides, there's one part of the temple that hasn't changed at all. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Screen fades slightly and reappears at a long hallway with airbending symbols through it. Shows all three looking at a door with an airbending contraption on it. \n",
      "KATARA: Hey, it's just like the one in the other temple! \n",
      "TEO: [Confidently, with a matter-of-fact tone.] Only an airbender can open it, so inside it's completely untouched. Just the way the monks left it. I've always wondered what it's like in there ... \n",
      "KATARA: [She looks at him, as though slightly scared of his reaction. Her tone is gentle and questioning.] Aang? \n",
      "AANG: [He turns away from the door and his friends.] I'm sorry. This is the last part of the temple that's the same as it was. I want it to stay that way. \n",
      "TEO: [Somewhat disappointed, although he tries not to let it show.] I completely understand. I just wanted you to know that it's here. \n",
      "AANG: Thanks. [All three start to walk away.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Screen cuts to Sokka and the mechanist walking down a dark stairway holding lanterns. \n",
      "SOKKA: These lanterns are terrible. I can't see! [Opens the top of his lantern only to find them filled with fireflies.] Why would you want to use fireflies for light? [One flies out.] \n",
      "MECHANIST: Hey! Close that up! They'll get loose! [Sokka closes it.] Fireflies are a non-flammable light source. [Both begin to walk again.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They continue for a while until they arrive at a wooden door. \n",
      "MECHANIST: Cover your nose [Both plug their noses.] and hold your breath. [The mechanist opens an eye slot in the door, both look inside a pitch-black room.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Nasally, due to his nose being blocked.] Okay ... so you brought me all the way down here to see an empty room. \n",
      "MECHANIST: [Closes eye slot.] Wrong. It's filled to the brim with natural gas. Came across it my first time here. Unfortunately, I was carrying a torch at the time. Nearly blew my self and the whole place even more sky high! Thought my eyebrows would never grow back. [Pans up to his eyebrows.] Anyway, there's a vital problem that needs solving. From time to time, we have gas leaks. And they're nearly impossible to find. \n",
      "SOKKA: So, this place is an explosion waiting to happen. \n",
      "MECHANIST: Yes, until I figure out how to locate something I can't see, hear, smell, or touch. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a exterior of temple with people flying in the sky. Aang, Katara and Teo are on the ground. \n",
      "TEO: The wind will carry you. It supports something inside you. Something even lighter than air. [Shows Katara holding a glider and standing at the edge of a building.] And that something takes over when you fly. [Katara puts down her glider and looks up at the other people flying.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Nervously.] I've changed my mind. I think I was born without that something. \n",
      "TEO: [Laughs.] Impossible! Everybody has it! \n",
      "AANG: Spirit. \n",
      "TEO: What? \n",
      "AANG: Spirit. That's the something you're talking about. \n",
      "TEO: [Thoughtfully.] Yeah, I suppose it is. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Shows Katara with the glider in her hands again. \n",
      "TEO: Are you ready? \n",
      "KATARA: No! [Jumps off anyway.] Aaaaah! [Starts to fall down wards, but eventually starts to fly straight. Her scream peters off as she begins laughing.] I can't believe I'm flying! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang and Momo fly up beside her. \n",
      "AANG: Just make sure you keep your mouth closed so you don't swallow a bug! [Shows Momo flying by and eating a bug.] \n",
      "KATARA: Teo was right about the air. All I had to do was trust it, let it carry me. \n",
      "AANG: Even though Teo's not an airbender, he really does have the spirit of one! [Aang lands beside him on the building.] I've been thinking. If you want to see what's in that room, I'd be happy to open the door for you. \n",
      "TEO: Great! \n",
      "KATARA: Wait! [Katara flies by.] How do I land this thing? What if I land over a-ack-ack-bleck! Bug! Bug! Ack, that was a bug! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back to Sokka and the mechanist. The mechanist is drawing on a large piece of paper and Sokka is looking through shelves. Sokka drops various things, including seven scrolls, four pieces of paper, a hard-boiled egg and a model of a hot air balloon. \n",
      "MECHANIST: I said don't touch anything! [Comes over to help Sokka pick things up.] Oh, don't worry. That experiment's old, [Referring to the hot air balloon.] and that egg was just part of last week's lunch. \n",
      "SOKKA: [He sniffs the air before wincing.] Ugh! Week old egg smell! \n",
      "MECHANIST: Quick, find that egg! [Both crawl around the floor looking for it.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Shows Aang, Teo and Katara at the door of the airbending room. \n",
      "TEO: I can't believe I'm finally going to see what's inside! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang airbends into the door's contraption, flipping three dials so air comes out of them. Cut to Sokka and the mechanist searching for the egg. \n",
      "SOKKA: How can something so small that you can't even see it make such a big stink!? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The mechanist looks up from searching. \n",
      "MECHANIST: That's the solution to our problem! \n",
      "SOKKA: Yeah ... [Both turn toward each other.] if we put a whole mess of rotten eggs in the cellar where the gas seeps up ... \n",
      "MECHANIST: ... The gas will mix with the smell of rotten eggs! \n",
      "SOKKA: Then, if there's a leak ... \n",
      "MECHANIST: ... You smell rotten eggs! Then, you just follow your nose to the place where the smell is coming from ... \n",
      "SOKKA: And plug up the hole where the gas is escaping! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Both throw up their hands. \n",
      "BOTH: You're a genius! [Bell rings on one of his desks.] \n",
      "MECHANIST: Something's wrong. [Stands up.] I've go to go! [Runs out the door and Sokka follows.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Shows Aang, Teo, and Katara walking into the large room. It's filled with Fire Nation weapons, tools and a red hot air balloon with the Fire Nation insignia on it. \n",
      "AANG: This is a nightmare. \n",
      "MECHANIST: [Walks in with Sokka behind him.] You don't understand! \n",
      "AANG: [Accusingly.] You're making weapons for the Fire Nation! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Angrily.] You make weapons for the Fire Nation?! \n",
      "TEO: Explain all this! Now! \n",
      "MECHANIST: [He is hesitant, but resigned as he begins to explain.] It was about a year after we moved here. Fire Nation soldiers found our settlement. You were too young to remember this, Teo. They were going to destroy everything! Burn it to the ground! I pleaded with them, I begged them to spare us! They asked what I had to offer. I offered ... my services. You must understand. I did this for you! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Teo looks away in shame and the mechanist leaves. The scene cuts to him in his workshop, placing two eggs with smiley faces in his hot air balloon model, along with a candle to make it float. He looks rather depressed. He lets go of the bottom and it starts to float. As this happens, the door opens, with Aang and Teo standing in the doorway. \n",
      "AANG: When are they coming? \n",
      "MECHANIST: Soon. [Candle pops once.] Very soon. \n",
      "AANG: You can't give them more weapons. \n",
      "MECHANIST: If I don't give them what they want, they will destroy this place! [The model of the hot air balloon catches fire and crashes. The mechanist puts the fire out with a cloth.] \n",
      "TEO: How can I be proud of you when your inventions are being used for murder? \n",
      "MECHANIST: I need some time to think. [Bell rings on his desk.] You need to leave! Go! \n",
      "TEO: We're not leaving! \n",
      "MECHANIST: Then hide! Quickly! [They hide behind some of his inventions. the mechanist pulls a rope that opens a trapdoor, and a war minister from the Fire Nation is lifted into the room.] \n",
      "QIN: You know better than to keep me waiting. Give me what you owe us so we can be on our way. [The mechanist looks down.] Well? Is there a problem? \n",
      "MECHANIST: [Hurredly.] No, right this way. [Gestures toward the door.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Qin is about to go out the door, but Aang airbends it shut. He jumps in front of the door. \n",
      "AANG: The deal's off. \n",
      "QIN: The Avatar ... \n",
      "MECHANIST: Aang, don't get involved! \n",
      "QIN: If I don't get what I came here for, the Fire Nation will burn this place to rubble! \n",
      "AANG: Get out of here! [Slaps him in the face with an air swipe; continues off screen.] You're leaving empty-handed! \n",
      "QIN: Then the destruction of this temple [Pointing at Aang.] will be on your head! [He leaves through the trap door and Aang airbends it shut.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The four children are now talking on the tall bridge. \n",
      "TEO: This is bad. \n",
      "SOKKA: Very bad! \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, what are we going to do? How can we possibly keep them all away? \n",
      "AANG: I'll tell you how. We have something they don't. [Points to the sky.] Air power. We control the sky. That's something the Fire Nation can't do. We can win! \n",
      "MECHANIST: I want to help. [He appears at the door.] \n",
      "AANG: Good. We'll need it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to an aerial shot of the temple, before cutting to the mechanist's workshop. He is standing behind a table with Sokka. The model hot air balloon, a few plans, and a candle are resting on the table. Aang, Katara, and Teo are on the other side, surrounded by other colonists. \n",
      "MECHANIST: We finally got the war balloon working, thanks to Sokka. This boy's a genius! \n",
      "SOKKA: Thank you. You're a genius! \n",
      "MECHANIST: Thank you! [Katara and Aang exchange unamused glances.] \n",
      "SOKKA: See, the problem with the old war balloon was you could get it air-borne, [Places the candle in the model.] but once it did, it just kept going. [He pulls a string connected to the model, putting it on the table.] You could put a hole in the top, but then all the hot air would escape. So the question became, how do you keep a lid on hot air? \n",
      "KATARA: Ugh, if only we knew. [Teo, Katara, and Aang laugh.] \n",
      "SOKKA: A lid is actually the answer. If you control the hot air, you control the war balloon. \n",
      "KATARA: Huh, that's actually pretty smart. \n",
      "SOKKA: Okay, we've got four kinds of bombs: [He begins listing them off on his fingers.] smoke, slime, fire, and ... \n",
      "MECHANIST: Stink! Never underestimate the power of stink! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to exterior shot of temple. Everyone is outside, watching anxiously for any sign of the Fire Nation. \n",
      "GIRL: [Looking over a ledge.] They're coming! \n",
      "TEO: Are we ready? \n",
      "KATARA: [Worriedly.] Yes. But where's Sokka with the war balloon? \n",
      "AANG: [Jumping off Appa.] We'll have to start without it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to shot of people readying their flying machines for take off. They begin the assault as their gliders fly off into the air. Cheers from the crowd below. Cut to Fire Nation troops climbing the cliff path. They are attacked by the various bombs thrown at them. Cut back to Aang and the other flyers going down through the clouds. The gliders fly over the Fire Nation troops dropping bombs below. Cut to Fire Nation troops on the cliff edge. \n",

      "ZHAO: Patience, Captain Li. This isn't some little earth village we can just march into. The Water Tribe is a great nation. There's a reason they've survived a hundred years of war.

      "ZHAO: Have you heard of the Blue Spirit, General Iroh? \n",
      "IROH: Just rumors. I don't think he is real. \n",
      "ZHAO: He's real, all right. [He hands the broad sword to Iroh.] He's a criminal, and an enemy of the Fire Nation. But I have a feeling justice will catch up with him soon.

      "AANG: Uhhh ... This is my friend, Katara. The one I told you about? \n",
      "PAKKU: I'm sorry, I think there's been a misunderstanding. You didn't tell me your friend was a girl. In our tribe, it is forbidden for women to learn waterbending. \n",

      "PAKKU: No. \n",
      "KATARA: But there must be other female waterbenders in your tribe! \n",
      "PAKKU: Here, the women learn from Yugoda to use their waterbending to heal. I'm sure she would be happy to take you as her student, despite your bad attitude. \n",
      "KATARA: I don't want to heal, I want to fight! \n",
      "PAKKU: I can see that. But our tribe has customs, rules. \n",
      "KATARA: [Furious.] Well, your rules stink! \n",
      "AANG: [Also just as angry.] Yeah, they're not fair! If you won't teach Katara, then ... \n",
      "PAKKU: Then what? \n",
      "AANG: Then I won't learn from you! \n",
      "PAKKU: Well, have fun teaching yourself! I'm sure you'll do a great job. \n",
      "KATARA: Wait! Aang didn't mean that! [Goes to Aang.] You can't risk your training for me. You have to learn from Master Pakku, even if he is a big jerk. \n",

      "YUGODA: Your betrothal necklace. You're getting married, right? \n",
      "KATARA: [Shocked.] Ah ... No. I don't think I'm ready for that yet. My grandmother gave my mother this necklace and my mother passed it down to me. \n",
      "YUGODA: I recognize this carving! I don't know why I didn't realize sooner; you're the spitting image of Kanna! \n",
      "KATARA: [Confused.] Wait, how do you know my Gran-Gran's name? \n",
      "YUGODA: When I was about your age, I was friends with Kanna. She was born here in the Northern Tribe. \n",
      "KATARA: She never told me. \n",
      "YUGODA: Your grandmother had an arranged marriage with a young waterbender. He carved that necklace for her. \n",
      "KATARA: If Gran-Gran was engaged, why did she leave? \n",
      "YUGODA: I don't know. That's always been a mystery to me. She left without saying goodbye. \n",

      "SOKKA: No, it's Princess Yue. I don't get it, one minute she wants to go out with me, and the next, she's telling me to get lost. [Changing the topic.] So, how's waterbending training? \n",
      "AANG: Master Poophead won't teach her because she's a girl. \n",
      "SOKKA: Why don't you just teach her, Aang? \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The next morning, the three meet with Chief Arnook, Master Pakku, and Arnook's family members. \n",
      "ARNOOK: What do you want me to do? Force Master Pakku to take Aang back as his student? \n",
      "KATARA: Yes ... please! \n",
      "ARNOOK: I suspect he might change his mind, if you swallow your pride and apologize to him. \n",
      "KATARA: Fine. \n",
      "PAKKU: I'm waiting, little girl. \n",
      "KATARA: No. [Begins cracking the ice inadvertently.] No way am I apologizing to a sour old man like you! [Two pots shatter.] \n",
      "AANG: Uhhh ... Katara? \n",
      "KATARA: I'll be outside if you're man enough to fight me. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Yue gasps. Katara angrily walks out. \n",
      "AANG: I'm sure she didn't mean that. \n",
      "SOKKA: Yeah, I think she did. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back at the Fire Navy base. Zhao meets with Iroh over tea. \n",
      "ZHAO: I'm devastated to hear about Prince Zuko. Just ... devastated. \n",
      "IROH: The Fire Lord will not be pleased when he learns who was responsible. \n",
      "ZHAO: You know who was behind the attack? \n",
      "IROH: Yes ... pirates. We had a run-in with them a while back. They wanted revenge. \n",
      "ZHAO: [Sips his tea.] So, have you reconsidered my offer? \n",
      "IROH: Yes, I accept. It will be an honor to serve as your general. To the Fire Nation! \n",
      "ZHAO: To victory! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back to the Northern Tribe. The three head outside, looking for Pakku. \n",
      "SOKKA: Are you crazy, Katara? You're not going to win this fight! \n",
      "KATARA: [Takes off her coat.] I know! I don't care! \n",
      "AANG: You don't have to do this for me. I can find another teacher. \n",
      "KATARA: I'm not doing it for you! Someone needs to slap some sense into that guy! [Pakku comes down.] So, you decided to show up? [Pakku walks away.] Aren't you going to fight? \n",
      "PAKKU: Go back to the healing huts with the other women where you belong. [Katara tightens her fist and sends water whips at him. Pakku halts.] Fine. You want to learn to fight so bad? Study closely! [He bends two streams of water from nearby pools and sends them both at a charging Katara, who falls back. He joins the two streams together, encircling both Katara and himself in a forceful ring of water.] Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara edges away from the ring and redirects the water away. The resulting blast hits Sokka. Pakku builds an ice wall in defense, which Katara slides up. She lands onto a nearby post. He melts the ice and directs the full blast at her. However, Katara freezes her feet down and is able to direct the blast away. \n",
      "KATARA: [Determined.] You can't knock me down! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Some of the crowd cheers. \n",
      "AANG: Go, Katara! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara charges at him; Pakku draws up a wall of ice, which she quickly liquefies. She attempts to land blows, but Pakku ducks them all. He whips water and throws her into a pool, earning the approval of other members of the crowd.\n",
      "Katara emerges from pool, shakes out her hair, and summons a small pillar of ice, where she proceeds to send a series of ice discs at her opponent. Pakku breaks up most of them using his wrists. The camera closes up to a slow-motion shot of one coming very close to hitting him. He looks at her in irritation. Katara, now back on the ground, attacks by sending a stream of water at him. However, Pakku generates it into a larger stream of water and sends it full force at her. Katara is sent back several feet. A close-up shot of her shows her bent over, breathing hard. She rises suddenly and sends two snow pillars down at him which Pakku turns to a dusty mist of snow. The mist clears. \n",
      "PAKKU: Well, I'm impressed. You are an excellent waterbender. \n",
      "KATARA: But you still won't teach me, will you? \n",
      "PAKKU: No. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara bends over sharply, sending a wave of ice at Pakku, who merely raises himself onto an ice pillar. He proceeds to liquefy the pillar, charging straight at Katara, who sends a powerful stream of water his way. Pakku avoids the attack, instead managing to freeze Katara's stream of water which he slides across. He surges past her and strikes her down, knocking her necklace off in the process. Katara falls roughly to the ground as Pakku lands onto the rim of a pool, bends a tower of water and manipulates the stream overhead his opponent. He deftly freezes the water into several ice shards, which he sends down at Katara. She becomes trapped in the flurry of frozen daggers and appears still for a moment. The crowd gasps in horror; one child looks away in fear. Katara lifts her head and begins to struggle, attempting to break free as Pakku casually strolls away. \n",
      "PAKKU: This fight is over. \n",
      "KATARA: Come back here. I'm not finished yet! \n",
      "PAKKU: Yes, you are. [Notices the necklace.] This is my necklace ... \n",
      "KATARA: No, it's not. It's mine! Give it back! \n",
      "PAKKU: I made this sixty years ago for the love of my life ... for Kanna. \n",
      "KATARA: [Unfreezing the ice; surprised.] My Gran-Gran was supposed to marry you? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back at the Fire Navy base. The ships are set to begin the trek north. On board, Iroh meets up with Zuko, who is disguised as a shipman. \n",
      "IROH: Our plan is working perfectly. Zhao doesn't suspect a thing. \n",
      "ZUKO: You didn't have to do this. \n",
      "IROH: No nephew of mine is going to stow away on a ship without some backup. \n",
      "ZUKO: Thank you, Uncle. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A door opens. \n",
      "IROH: Someone's coming. Stay hidden until we get to the North Pole and the Avatar will be yours. Good luck. [The two head their separate ways.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes back to the North Pole. \n",
      "PAKKU: I carved this necklace for your grandmother when we got engaged. I thought we would have a long, happy life together. I loved her. \n",
      "KATARA: But she didn't love you, did she? It was an arranged marriage. Gran-Gran wouldn't let your tribe's stupid customs run her life. That's why she left. It must have taken a lot of courage. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Yue cries and runs away. \n",
      "AANG: [To Sokka.] Go get her. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka exits. Later that night, he catches up with her on the bridge. \n",
      "YUE: What do you want from me? \n",
      "SOKKA: Nothing. I just want you to know, I think you're beautiful, and, I never thought a girl like you would even notice a guy like me. \n",
      "YUE: You don't understand. \n",
      "SOKKA: No, no. See, that's the thing. I think I do understand now. You're a Princess, and I'm ... I'm just a Southern peasant. \n",
      "YUE: No, Sokka ... \n",
      "SOKKA: It's okay. You don't have to say anything. I'll see you around, okay? [Yue grabs him and kisses him.] Okay, now I'm really confused. Happy, but confused. \n",
      "YUE: I do like you, a lot. But we can't be together, and not for the reason you think. It's because ... I'm engaged. [She pulls down the collar of her coat and shows him her betrothal necklace.] I'm sorry. [Runs off.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The next morning, at Pakku's class. Aang turns a blob of water into a stream and awkwardly sends it off. \n",
      "PAKKU: Not bad, not bad. [Laughs.] Keep practicing and maybe you'll get it by the time you're my age. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang turns around, annoyed, but quickly smiles when he notices Katara coming up. \n",
      "AANG: Hey, Katara! \n",
      "PAKKU: What do you think you're doing? [Pause as Katara looks up.] It's past sunrise. You're late. \n",
      "AANG: Good to see you here. \n",
      "KATARA: You, too. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back at the Fire Navy fleet. Zhao and Iroh stand on top of the lead ship. \n",
      "ZHAO: My fleet is ready. Set a course for the Northern Water Tribe. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a panning overhead shot, which reveals dozens of Fire Navy ships firing up their engines in preparation to launch the final assault on the Northern Water Tribe. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to white, followed by credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens to under the water. The camera pans upward to sea level, and higher up into the city. The scene changes to where Katara is set to spar with a young boy named Sangok. She eyes her opponent with a look of determination. Sangok looks at her with a frightened expression on his face, shaking slightly. He summons a globule of water, freezes it into an iceball, and fires it at her. Katara, however, is quick to melt the iceball and, turning around swiftly, bends a wave of water at him, which she proceeds to freeze, thus suspending Sangok in an icy trap. \n",
      "PAKKU: [Displeased.] Nice try, Pupil Sangok. [Shows Sangok trying to break free.] A couple of more years and you might be ready to fight a sea sponge. [He unfreezes the ice; Sangok falls to the ground dazed.] Would anyone care for a rematch with Katara? [The scene cuts to several students sitting by the sidelines, the camera panning to the right showing all of them to be tired and unamused.] Katara, you've advanced more quickly than any student I've ever trained. [Cuts to a shot of Katara, who smiles brightly.] You have proven that with fierce determination, passion and hard work, you can accomplish anything. [Turns to Aang irritably.] Raw talent alone is not enough. [Cut to Aang who is lying on the ground with a lazy smile, floating Momo around on an airball above him.] Pupil Aang! \n",
      "AANG: [Stops bending at the sound of his name; Momo lands on his head.] Yes, Master Pakku? \n",
      "PAKKU: [Sarcastically.] Care to step into the sparring circle? I figure since you've found time to play with house pets, you must have already mastered waterbending. \n",
      "AANG: [Jumps off the ground with airbending.] I wouldn't say mastered, but check this out. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He twists around, bending some snow around him to make a snowman of himself, which Momo knocks over. Cut to Pakku and Katara who wear similar expressions of disdain. Pakku shakes his head in disappointment, while Katara looks on in irritation. The scene changes to another part of the city where Sokka and Yue are taking a walk along a bridge. Sokka is walking along the top of bridge's wall while balancing. \n",
      "YUE: So they don't have palaces in the Southern Tribe? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sitting down on the ledge.] Are you kidding? I grew up in a block of ice. It's not exactly a cultural hub. \n",
      "YUE: [Laughs and places her hand on Sokka's shoulder; when Sokka smiles at her, she gets a little upset and looks at him seriously.] Sokka, this is wrong. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Protesting.] What's wrong? We're taking a walk! \n",
      "YUE: [Unsurely.] I'm engaged. It just feels ... \n",
      "SOKKA: [Brightens.] I know what you need. [He hops off the rail to stand by her side.] You need to meet my good friend, Appa. \n",
      "YUE: [Curiously.] Who? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to where the two approach the stables, where Appa is resting. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Opening his arms out in enthusiasm.] Appa and I go way back, don't we, boy? [The thunder of Appa's shifting bulk is heard and Sokka's features turn to surprise. Appa enters from the left and lands on top of him and licks him, much to Sokka's dismay.] Ah, ah, easy! Down boy! Agh! No, up! \n",
      "YUE: Looks like you haven't been giving Appa enough attention! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Yue laughs. Sokka attempts to pull himself free of Appa, who continues to lick his face. The scene changes to the two sitting on Appa's saddle, Sokka holding the reins in his hand. \n",
      "YUE: [Excitedly.] So, how does this work? \n",
      "SOKKA: You holding on tight? [Yue nods; in a cool tone.] Yip ... [Cut to a close up of Sokka's face.] yip. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera zooms out to a shot of the entire city as Appa takes off. \n",
      "YUE: [Impressed.] Oh ... my ... goodness! [Cuts to where Appa is soaring over the ocean; Yue is looking over the saddle.] Wow, I can't believe you do this every day. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Stretches.] Yeah, we pretty much live up here. \n",
      "YUE: Is it always this cold in the sky? [Moves closer to Sokka.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Happily.] Not when you're with someone. \n",
      "YUE: [Turning to face Sokka, blushing.] It's beautiful up here. \n",
      "SOKKA: Yeah ... [The two turn to each other and slowly begin to lean in, but at the very last moment, Sokka widens his eyes, turns away and pretends to act cool again.] Woo, yeah! Ahhh, good times, good times. [Snow and black soot start to fall from the sky.] Hey, look! \n",
      "YUE: [Camera zooms out to Appa flying through the gray snowfall; worried.] What's happening? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Nervous.] Oh no ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to where civilians have stopped to observe the sooty snow. Cuts to Aang, who laughs as he gleefully rolls around in the snow in a circular pattern. Cuts to Momo, who opens his mouth and catches a sooty snowflake only to bristle and spit out the contents. Aang stops playing around and looks up at the snowfall with a concerned face. Cuts to civilians standing near a fountain. Camera pans down to show the fountain's water turning black. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Picking up handful of black snow.] Soot. \n",
      "YUE: What? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene reveals Sokka, Yue, and Appa having landed right outside the outskirts of the city, near the shores of the North Pole seas. Sokka is kneeling down, observing the snow. \n",
      "SOKKA: I've seen this before, right before my village was attacked. It's soot mixed with snow. [Rises.] \n",
      "YUE: But, why? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Looking out over the horizon.] It's the Fire Nation. [Looks at Yue concerned.] They've closed in on the North Pole and from the looks of this stuff, [Camera zooms out to show the enormity of the sooty snowfall.] I'd say there's a lot of them. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to the lead ship sailing toward the Water Tribe, under the command of Admiral Zhao and Iroh. \n",
      "ZHAO: [Voice-over.] This will truly be one for the history books, General Iroh. [Cuts to Zhao and Iroh standing on deck.] Just think, centuries from now, people will study the great Admiral Zhao, who destroyed the last of the Water Tribe civilization. You're lucky you're here to see it. \n",
      "IROH: [Tersely.] Be careful what you wish for, Admiral. History is not always kind to its subjects. \n",
      "ZHAO: I suppose you speak from experience, but rest assured. This will be nothing like your legendary failure at Ba Sing Se. [Walks forward.] \n",
      "IROH: [Sadly.] I hope not, for your sake. \n",
      "ZHAO: Tell the captains to prepare for first strike. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Iroh walks away. Cuts to the bow of the lead ship breaking through thick ice floes floating in the water. Cuts to the interior of the ship, where Iroh is confronting Zuko disguised as a Fire Nation soldier. Zuko is forced to wear the disguise to keep the secret from Zhao that he survived an attempted assassination. \n",
      "IROH: [Secretly.] We'll be landing soon. Do you have a plan? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Removes face covering to reveal his face covered in cuts.] I'm working on it, Uncle. [Puts covering back in place.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two head off in separate directions. Back at the Northern Water Tribe, citizens flee to the town hall, as two watchmen hit a drum to signal the Fire Nation's approach. Sokka and Yue make their way up the steps, but Yue stops the approach. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Trying to drag her along.] What's wrong? [Pointing up to the citadel.] We have to go! \n",
      "YUE: [Sadly; lets go of Sokka's hand.] No, Sokka, wait, I can't see you anymore. Not at all. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Protesting.] What? We're just friends. \n",
      "YUE: I wish we could just be friends, but I like you too much and it's too confusing to be around you. I'm marrying someone else! [Turns away sorrowfully.] \n",
      "SOKKA: You don't love him, do you? You don't even seem to like him. \n",
      "YUE: But I do love my people. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Objecting.] You're not marrying them. \n",
      "YUE: [Turns to face Sokka.] You don't understand. I have duties to my father, to my tribe. I have to do this. Goodbye. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She runs past Sokka up the stairs quickly. Closes up on Sokka, who looks on with dismay. The scene cuts to inside the chief's Royal Palace. \n",
      "ARNOOK: The day we have feared for so long has arrived. The Fire Nation is on our doorstep. It is with great sadness I call my family here before me, knowing well that some of these faces are about to vanish from our tribe, [While saying this line, the scene flashes from Yue to Pakku to Hahn.] but they will never vanish from our hearts. Now, as we approach the battle for our existence, I call upon the great spirits. Spirit of the Ocean! Spirit of the Moon! Be with us! I'm going to need volunteers for a dangerous mission. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Rising from his seat.] Count me in! \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka ... \n",
      "ARNOOK: Be warned, many of you will not return. [Several Water Tribe men rise and walk forward.] Come forward to receive my mark, if you accept the task. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Arnook paints three red line marks with his fingers on one man's forehead. The man walks away, slightly sorrowful. Sokka steps forward and Arnook paints the same three marks. He begins walking away sadly and turns to look at Yue. After staring at each other for a few moments, Sokka continues walking. Yue averts her gaze, closes her eyes and begins crying.\n",
      "The scene changes to outside the city where Aang is perched on a snow mound, holding his staff. Arnook approaches him. \n",
      "ARNOOK: The stillness before battle is unbearable. Such a quiet dread. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara joins them. \n",
      "AANG: I wasn't there when the Fire Nation attacked my people. [Determined.] I'm going to make a difference this time. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He rises and holds his staff behind his back in a similar pose as seen in the opening sequence. The camera pans upward to the sky. The scene changes to where Aang, Katara, Sokka, Appa and all the warriors are gathered at the wall. Something distant can be seen soaring toward the city from the horizon. Aang squints his eyes before realizing the object is a fireball. Cuts to Sokka and Katara, who look on in terror. The fireball collides into the wall of the city, sending Team Avatar and several warriors flying back. Cuts to the wall of the city, damaged and beginning to fall apart.\n",
      "Cuts to another fireball being launched into the air. The fireball disintegrates a bridge within the city. Cuts to a trebuchet operator launching another fireball into the air, which hits the wall. \n",
      "AANG: Yip-yip! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He and Appa take flight, heading toward the fleet. Cuts to the warriors who regather themselves, helping each other up. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Pulls his arm free from the snow.] Katara! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara uses waterbending to free herself from a snow mound she became buried underneath. Sokka smiles and hoists his sister onto her feet. The two cast their eyes upward, catching sight of two fireballs that soar overhead. Cuts to Appa who grunts, Aang guiding him, a determined look on his face. Cuts to bird's-eyes view of the ocean, Aang flying toward a single Fire Navy ship. Two fireballs are launched. Cuts to the deck of the ship, where trebuchet operators launch another fireball back to Appa and Aang. Cuts to fireball soaring straight toward Aang, who uses his glider to direct it into an icy cliff side near the city. \n",
      "AANG: I'll take it from here, boy. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He jumps down from Appa and flies downward on his glider onto the first ship. Using airbending, he sweeps several trebuchet operators off their feet and leaps onto one trebuchet. An operator comes forward and slams a sledgehammer onto the machine, nearly striking Aang who manages to back-flip away. Cuts to where he stands on top of the contraption, two more operators approaching him from opposite directions, each holding a sledgehammer. The one on his right brings the sledgehammer down proceeded by the one on his left. He jumps into the air, avoiding both blows and completely collapses the trebuchet with his glider and the use of airbending. He lands onto the deck, triumphant.\n",
      "He runs over to an unoccupied trebuchet, already loaded with a flaming boulder. He sticks a sledgehammer in another launcher's chain. When a soldier approaches him, Aang blasts him away, activating the catapult which launches the fireball straight into the deck, leaving a large hole. The camera zooms out on the damage.\n",
      "Cuts to Aang, who runs past two operators who quickly chase after him. He arrives at two trebuchets, one before him and one behind him, and tangles their chains together. He leaps onto the machine before him as the soldiers approach and slams his foot onto the pedal that activates the catapult. The catapult lunges forward, causing the second trebuchet to collide into the first, destroying both.\n",
      "Smiling happily, Aang proceeds to another machine. Cuts to a burly man, who observes him evilly. Aang prepares to strike the machine with a sledgehammer only to turn around and catch sight of the man who attempts to land blows from afar with two sledgehammers, each attached to long chains. Aang jumps out of the way of several blows. Cuts to the man who swings the chains around. Aang leans against a beam only for the two chains to wrap around the beam thus trapping him. He struggles to break free.\n",
      "Cuts to the soldier, who is suddenly knocked over by Appa's paw. The chains snap and Aang breaks free. \n",
      "AANG: [Brightening.] Appa! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa leans over the deck of the ship and tosses the man overboard before turning to Aang, who runs over and embraces him. \n",
      "AANG: Thanks for the rescue, buddy! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: His expression of relief becomes one of alarm when the ship begins to rumble. Cuts to an undamaged trebuchet that collapses when a gigantic spike of ice pierces straight through the hull and deck of the ship. Cuts to dozens of Water Tribe warriors riding on boats, who are using waterbending to suspend the ship. Cuts to the entire ship being uprooted. Cuts to Appa, who stands on the sloping deck, the ruins of machinery sliding downward past them. He and Aang take off. Cuts to the horizon, where an entire fleet comes into view, the ships large in quantity. \n",
      "AANG: [Shocked.] You've got to be kidding me ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to the training for the mission. \n",
      "ARNOOK: Men, you'll be infiltrating the Fire Nation Navy. That means you'll all need one of these uniforms. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera pans upward, revealing a young man, Hahn, who appears in the uniform that will be used. Sokka laughs. The rest of the warriors turn to stare at him. \n",
      "HAHN: [Angrily.] What's your problem? \n",
      "SOKKA: Fire Navy uniforms don't look like that. \n",
      "HAHN: [Irritably.] Of course they do. These are real uniforms captured from actual Fire Navy soldiers. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sarcastically.] When, like, a hundred years ago? \n",
      "ARNOOK: Eighty-five. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Walks over and flings one of the shoulder spikes with his finger.] The Fire Nation doesn't wear shoulder spikes anymore. The newer uniforms are more streamlined. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka bends the tip of one of the shoulder spikes back with the tip of his finger and lets go. It bounces back to its original shape with a little comic sound effect. \n",
      "HAHN: How do we know we can trust this guy? [Turns to growl at Sokka, who glares at him in return.] Such bold talk for a new recruit. \n",
      "ARNOOK: Sokka is from our sister tribe, Hahn. He's a capable warrior and I value his input. [Sokka shoots Hahn a smug look; Arnook turns to the rest of the regiment.] Now, our first objective is to determine the identity of their commanding officer. \n",
      "SOKKA: His name is Zhao. Middle-aged, [Tracing imaginary sideburns with his fingers.] big sideburns, bigger temper ... \n",
      "ARNOOK: Sokka, I want you to tell everything you know to Hahn. He's leading this mission. Hahn, show Sokka your respect. [Beginning to walk away.] I expect nothing less from my future son-in-law. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Stares at Hahn, mouth agape; points at him and narrows his eyes.] Princess Yue's marrying you? \n",
      "HAHN: [Irritated.] Yeah, what of it? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Turns away from Hahn, upset.] Nothing. Congratulations. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene fades to sunset where fireballs are continually launched. A bird's-eye view is shown of the fleet attacking the city. Cuts to several fireballs; camera pans downward to show them hitting the city. \n",
      "PAKKU: [Pointing to the sky.] Stop those fireballs! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of oncoming fireball. The waterbenders bend up a column of water and freeze it, capturing the fireball. Cuts to side-view of the leading ships of the fleet, the uprooted ship in view. The scene cuts to the interior of Zhao's ship. \n",
      "IROH: It's almost twilight, Admiral. As your military consultant, I must advise you to halt your attack. [Cuts to shot of the ship, sailing past a rising moon.] The waterbenders draw their power from the moon, and it is nearly full tonight. You should wait and resume the attack at daybreak. [Cuts back to Iroh and Zhao.] \n",
      "ZHAO: Oh, I'm well aware of the moon problem and I am working on a solution. But for now, daybreak it is. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The lead ship drops its anchor, followed by the rest of the ships, who drop their anchors and cease the attack. Cuts to a shot of the city, smoke billowing from several spots. Yue can be seen looking out over the horizon. \n",
      "YUE: They've stopped firing. \n",

      "KATARA: What happened? \n",
      "AANG: [Dimly.] I must have taken out a dozen Fire Navy ships, but there's just too many of them. I can't fight them all. \n",
      "YUE: [Pleadingly.] But, you have to. You're the Avatar. \n",
      "AANG: [Solemnly.] I'm just one kid. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He buries his face in his arms. Katara kneels down beside him in an attempt to comfort him. The scene changes to nightfall on the lead ship. Cuts inside a room where Zuko prepares a boat, winding up some rope. Iroh enters. \n",
      "IROH: If you're fishing for an octopus my nephew, you need a tightly woven net, or he will squeeze through the tiniest hole and escape. \n",
      "ZUKO: I don't need your wisdom right now, Uncle. \n",
      "IROH: I'm sorry. I just nag you, because ... well, [Voice breaking slightly.] ever since I lost my son ... \n",
      "ZUKO: Uncle, you don't have to say it. \n",
      "IROH: ... I think of you as my own. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Faces his uncle, a softer expression on his face.] I know, Uncle. We'll meet again. [Iroh hugs him.] After I have the Avatar. [He turns away and gets on the boat.] \n",
      "IROH: Remember your breath of fire. It could save your life out there. \n",
      "ZUKO: I will. [Lowers the boat, suspended by ropes, down the side of the ship into the water.] \n",

      "HAHN: [Smugly.] Let me tell you Sokka, I've courted a lot of girls, but Yue is the finest and she comes with the most perks. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Annoyed.] Perks? What does that mean? \n",
      "HAHN: I mean, Yue's nice and everything, but the points I'll gain with the chief aren't bad either. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Angered.] Princess Yue is wasted on a self-absorbed weasel like you! \n",
      "HAHN: [Camera begins closing up on Hahn.] Whoa, hang on. What do you care? [Sokka closes his eyes sorrowfully.] You're just a simple rube from the Southern Tribe. What would you know of the political complexities of our life? [Smirking.] No offense. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Shouts and tackles Hahn; the two begin rolling around on the floor in a struggle.] You're just a jerk without a soul, no offense! \n",

Cuts back to Zuko who continues to paddle toward the wall, before switching to a shot of him peering from behind an ice spike, his canoe pulled up onto the ice. Camera cuts to and zooms in on a shot of several Water Tribe guards marching atop the wall. Zuko turns around and sees a group of turtle seals resting by a hole in the ice. One seal plunges head first into the icy water. Zuko looks back up to the wall and begins approaching the hole. \n",

      "YUE: [Off camera.] The legends say the moon was the first waterbender. [Cuts to shot of her, Katara and Aang standing on a balcony, looking up at the sky.] Our ancestors saw how it pushed and pulled the tides and learned how to do it themselves. \n",
      "KATARA: I've always noticed my waterbending is stronger at night. \n",
      "YUE: Our strength comes from the spirit of the moon. Our life comes from the spirit of the ocean. [Camera pans slightly downward, showing Aang with a dull expression on his face.] They work together to keep balance. \n",
      "AANG: [Brightening.] The spirits! [Raises head, startling Momo.] Maybe I can find them and get their help! \n",
      "YUE: How can you do that? \n",
      "KATARA: [Approaching her.] The Avatar is the bridge between our world and the Spirit World! Aang can talk to them! \n",
      "YUE: [To Aang.] Maybe they'll give you the wisdom to win this battle! \n",
      "AANG: [Waves arms out in gesture.] Or maybe they'll unleash a crazy amazing spirit attack on the Fire Nation! [The two girls look at him oddly; Aang looks at them and straightens up.] Or wisdom. That's good, too. \n",
      "KATARA: The only problem is, last time you got to the Spirit World by accident. How are you going to get there this time? \n",
      "YUE: I have an idea. Follow me. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She begins walking away. Cuts to a shot of the chief's Royal Palace, the camera panning downward to the ground where Yue walks by, followed by Aang and Katara. Cuts to shot of Yue standing by a small, round wooden door, Aang approaching close behind. \n",
      "AANG: [Walking up to the door.] So, is this the way to the Spirit World? \n",
      "YUE: [Laughs.] No. You'll have to get there on your own. [Leans inward.] But I can take you to the most spiritual place in the entire North Pole. [Opens the door.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang steps inside. The camera pans upward and zooms in to reveal a small verdant oasis lying ahead, a waterfall flowing directly behind it. Zooms in on Aang, who gasps in amazement. \n",
      "AANG: [Runs to the back of the oasis and rolls around on the ground.] I never thought I'd miss grass this much! \n",
      "KATARA: [Approaching the oasis.] It's so warm here! How is that possible? \n",
      "YUE: It's the center of all spiritual energy in our land. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two girls remove their coats. Cuts to view of two fish, one black and one white, swimming about in the pond. Momo sticks his hand in the pond and tries to grab the two fish in the water. Cuts to shot of the two girls standing over him, looking rather irritated. \n",
      "AANG: You're right, Yue. I can feel ... something. It's so tranquil. [Positions himself to meditate.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Meanwhile, Zuko emerges from the water through another hole in the ice. He lies on his back on the ice and catches his breath. He rolls over onto his side, begins shivering and breathes fire to warm himself. \n",
      "ZUKO: [To the barking turtle seals.] Be quiet! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The pack of seals quiets down. Cuts to shot of several seals, who watch as Zuko walks past, pushing aside the heads of two of them. They resume barking. He makes his way through another opening where water is pouring out. Cuts to shot of his foot boring into the wall as he tries to steady himself and make his way through the channel of water. Cuts to inside the channel, where he slowly crawls his way through. Cut back to the warriors' base. Sokka is crouched on the floor, sharpening his boomerang when he is approached. \n",
      "ARNOOK: Is something wrong, Sokka? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sarcastically.] Oh, no. Hahn's out there on the top-secret mission while I'm here sharpening my boomerang. Everything's fine. \n",
      "ARNOOK: Listen to me. I took you off the mission for selfish reasons. I have a special task in mind for you. \n",
      "SOKKA: What, you want me to scrub the barracks? \n",
      "ARNOOK: I want you to guard my daughter, Princess Yue. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Rises and tries to act cool.] Oh ... Sure. That ... shouldn't be too hard. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Arnook exits the scene; Sokka's face falls. Zuko continues to make his way through the channel of water. He exits from the channel and floats to the surface of the water. He emerges from the surface and inhales deeply several times. He proceeds to duck his head under the water, surveying the area. The camera zooms in on another channel. Zuko swims toward the channel and upward. As he attempts to resurface, however, the surface of the water had frozen into a thick ice patch. Zuko tries to break through the ice. He suddenly exhales, signaling his need for air. He heats his hands using firebending and melts a hole in the ice. Cuts to a tunnel way in the city, the ice steaming and finally melting away. Zuko emerges and catches his breath. He relaxes against the wall of the tunnel. The scene changes back to the Spirit Oasis, where Aang is meditating, Katara and Yue watching him. \n",
      "YUE: Why is he sitting like that? \n",
      "KATARA: He's meditating, trying to cross over into the Spirit World. [Aang scrunches up his face in concentration.] It takes all his concentration. \n",
      "YUE: Is there any way we can help? \n",
      "AANG: [Angrily.] How about some quiet? Come on guys, I can hear every word you're saying! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera zooms in on the pond, where the two koi fish are shown circling each other. Cuts to shot of beneath the pond, showing an underside-view of the two fish. Cuts to shot of Aang staring at the fish, seemingly mesmerized. Cuts back to two fish circling each other before switching back to Aang. Cuts back to image of the two fish, which morphs into an image of the symbols for yin and yang. Cuts back to Aang, as his eyes and tattoos to light up. \n",
      "YUE: [Worried.] Is he okay? \n",
      "KATARA: He's crossing into the Spirit World. He'll be fine as long as we don't move his body. [Cuts to overhead shot of the pond.] That's his way back to the physical world. \n",
      "YUE: Maybe we should get some help. \n",
      "KATARA: [Smiling.] No, he's my friend. I'm perfectly capable of protecting him. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Sarcastically.] Well, aren't you a big girl now. \n",
      "KATARA: [Alarmed and dismayed.] No ... \n",
      "ZUKO: [Determined.] Yes. Hand him over and I won't have to hurt you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Yue runs from the scene as Katara assumes a defensive stance, Zuko appearing on screen. Cuts to Zuko, who kicks up his leg, sending a fire blast Katara's way. He fires more blasts from his hands. Cuts to shot of Zuko and Katara, Zuko continually firing as Katara conjures up water shields to deflect the attacks. Cuts to Katara, who draws water from the pond and sends the stream at Zuko, who is preparing another attack. The blast pushes Zuko back several feet and knocks him to the ground. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Rising.] I see you've learned a new trick, but I didn't come this far to lose to you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He turns around and fires another blast which Katara blocks by summoning another shield of water. Cuts to shot of Zuko, Katara, and Aang as Katara sends a powerful jet of water at her opponent. The jet collides into Zuko, who is sent farther back. As he attempts to steady himself from the impact, small juts of ice form around his feet. Cuts to close-up of Katara, a determined look on her face. Water begins rising around Zuko and encircling him. Katara waves her arms about wildly, forming a ball of water around him which she freezes solid. Cuts to close-up of her as she smiles triumphantly. Cuts to Zuko imprisoned in the ice. \n",
      "ZUKO: You little peasant. You've found a master, haven't you? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The globule of ice begins glowing bright orange with heat and the ground rumbles. Cuts to view of entire globule as it heats up intensely before melting. He fires repeated attacks at Katara, who draws water from the oasis to deflect the attacks. She prepares to strike him with a water blast, however, Zuko manages to slip away and head toward Aang. Just as his fingers grasp Aang's collar, Katara fires a water blast, throwing Zuko to the other wall. She whips up a large wave and sends the attack at Zuko. The rush of water sends Zuko up the side of the cliff; she freezes the water, encasing him in ice. Cuts to Pakku who looks over the horizon in the city as the sun rises. The scene cuts to Zhao's ship. \n",
      "ZHAO: It's daybreak at last. Let's write history. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back to the Spirit Oasis, rays of sunlight beam down on Zuko, who remains imprisoned in the ice, his head bent down. He feels the heat and sharply raises his head. With a determined look on his face, he breathes steam from his nose, melting the ice quickly. He lands on the ground and fires a blast at Katara, who had her back turned to him at that moment. She turns around swiftly and attempts to deflect the blast by conjuring a water shield; however, she creates the shield too late. The blast sends her slamming into the gate to the Spirit World, knocking her out. Smoke from the impact fills the screen. Cuts to shot of Zuko standing over her, holding Aang by the collar. \n",
      "ZUKO: You rise with the moon ... I rise with the sun. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to where Fire Navy ships break through the city wall, their bows crumbling the wall, allowing soldiers armed with spears to rush in. \n",
      "ZHAO: The Water Tribe can try to resist the inevitable, but their city will fall today. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts back to the oasis. Camera focuses on a close-up of Katara, whose eyes suddenly snap open as she regains consciousness, only to realize Aang is gone. She crawls around, desperately searching for him. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka and Yue enter on Appa. \n",

Cuts to shot of the two koi fish, the Moon and Ocean Spirits, swimming in their usual circular pattern. \n",

      "SOKKA: You did everything you could, and now we need to do everything we can to get him back. [Cuts to shot of Katara who looks up at her brother, tears in her eyes.] Zuko can't have gotten far. We'll find him. Aang's gonna be fine. \n",
      "KATARA: Okay. [Closes eyes and gets up. Camera pans over to where Momo remains motionless on the ground. Cuts to shot of Appa, Katara having mounted the bison.] It's all right. You stay here, Momo, in case Aang comes back. \n",
      "SOKKA: Yip, yip. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera pans upward as Appa takes off, heading upward to a location above the oasis, a vast frozen tundra where a blizzard is raging. Cuts to shot of the icy terrain of the tundra as the bison progresses. Cuts to shot of the ground, a path visible in the snow where someone has clearly been trudging along; the camera pans upward. Cuts to shot of Zuko plodding through the snow, his face partially covered to protect him from the cold, Aang slung across his back. Cuts to shot of an unconscious Aang, his tattooed arrows glowing.\n",
      "The scene changes suddenly, zooming out on Aang who is sitting in a meditating position on a small wooden platform in an unknown location in the Spirit World. Cuts to shot of his surroundings which are not that of the icy tundra, but a mystical swamp dotted with trees. A large white bird of some sort flies past. Cuts to shot of Aang as the bird flies over the screen; he stands and begins wandering about. Cuts to shot of a figure in the distance sitting beneath a simple wooden entranceway. The figure can be heard uttering the sound \"Ohm\". Aang appears on-screen, turns his head in the direction of the sound and begins making his way toward the figure. Cuts to side-view of the figure, a monkey-like creature, as Aang approaches him, before cutting to a shot of the two with the figure's back to the camera. \n",
      "AANG: Hello? I'm sorry to disturb you. I just really need to find the Moon and the Ocean Spirits. \n",

      "AANG: Yes, I need - \n",
      "BABOON.SPIRIT: [Cut to close-up of the baboon spirit who shuts his eyes tightly. Louder, trying to distract himself.] Ohm! [A firefly flies past; points at the insect.] Perhaps that thing will help you. Chase it. [Aang runs after it. The mystical monkey keeps his eyes shut for a second more before opening one to confirm Aang's departure. He shakes his head and breathes a sigh of relief.] Finally. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to a shot of Aang chasing the insect throughout the swamp and up a tree. He leaps up and manages to grasp hold of it and is delighted in doing so. Cuts to zoomed out shot of him as he lands on a tree branch which instantly shrivels up and disappears entirely, causing him to fall. Cuts briefly to close-up shot of an alarmed Aang before switching to a shot of him falling into the water. Aang is shown lying on his back in the water, the firefly having escaped his grip. It flies away as he tries to reach it again. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts back to the real world, where Zuko continues his trek through the icy tundra. Cuts to close-up of him before a shot of the ground where he steps on ice that begins cracking beneath his feet; his eyes widen in surprise at this. Cuts to overhead shot of him, the camera zooming out, as the ice begins to splinter and cave in. Cuts to shot of him on high alert as he begins running, before switching to an overhead shot of him as he races through the snow. Cuts to shot of him as the impact of the ice caving in throws him off-balance.\n",
      "Zuko is thrown several feet away and lands roughly in the snow, losing his grip on Aang and kicking up a cloud of snow. The cloud dissipates, showing Zuko and Aang lying in the snow. Cuts to shot of Zuko, as he raises his head and looks at the scene. Cuts to shot of the aftermath of the cave-in, the ground severely disrupted, and a shot of Zuko once more. He spots a cave off in the distance. \n",

      "AANG: Roku, the Water Tribe's under attack. I need to find the Ocean and the Moon Spirits. \n",
      "ROKU: [Pops out of the reflection in front of Aang.] The Ocean and the Moon are ancient spirits. They crossed over the Spirit World to the mortal world very near the beginning. There is only one spirit I know of who is old enough to remember. \n",
      "AANG: Who? \n",
      "ROKU: The spirit's name is Koh, but he is very dangerous. They call him the Face Stealer. [Aang looks horrified.] When you speak with him, you must be very careful to show no emotion at all. Not the slightest expression, or he will steal your face. [Aang looks even more horrified but calmly nods, understanding the situation.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Meanwhile, in the real world, Katara, Sokka, and Yue arrive to where the ice broke earlier. In the cave, Zuko is keeping warm with Breath of Fire while Aang, now tied up, remains in the Spirit World. \n",
      "ZUKO: I finally have you, but I can't get you home because of this blizzard. [Stands up and looks outside the cave.] There's always something. Not that you would understand. You're like my sister. Everything always came easy to her. She's a firebending prodigy, and everyone adores her. My father says she was born lucky. He says I was lucky to be born. I don't need luck, though. I don't want it. I've always had to struggle and fight and that's made me strong. It's made me who I am. \n",

      "ZHAO: [Continuing as if nothing happened.] As I was saying, years ago I stumble upon a great and powerful secret: the identity of the Moon Spirit's mortal form. \n",
      "IROH: What? \n",
      "ZHAO: I was a young lieutenant serving under General Shu in the Earth Kingdom. [Fade to a flashback of a young Zhao tearing through scrolls in a library.] I discovered a hidden library. Underground, in fact. I tore through scroll after scroll. One of them contained a detailed illustration, and the words \"moon\" and \"ocean\". I knew then that these spirits could be found and killed. [The memory ends with a close up of Zhao's eyes, fade to the present.] And that it was my destiny to do so. \n",
      "IROH: [Somewhat angrily.] Zhao, the spirits are not to be trifled with! \n",
      "ZHAO: Yes, yes ... I know you fear the spirits, Iroh. I've heard rumors about your journey into the Spirit World. But the Ocean and Moon gave up their immortality to become a part of our world. And now they will face the consequences. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back in the Spirit World, Aang walks up a giant tree, seeing the entrance to the cave Koh can be found in. Aang stares and slightly steps toward the cave hearing creepy noises. He glances to his left noticing that the noise wasn't coming from the cave. Aang sighs in relief. \n",
      "AANG: You're just a curly tailed blue nose. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The monkey turns its head toward Aang, exposing that he has no face. \n",

      "AANG: Hello? I-I'm looking for a spirit named 'Koh'. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As Aang says the spirit's name, some \"roots\" on the ceiling begin to move. Aang looks around, sensing movement, but sees nothing. Cut to a close-up of Aang's face that pans slightly left, leaving the right hand portion of the screen over his shoulder momentarily empty. A moment later, a white face appears with gray patches around its eyes and luscious, blood-red lips. Cut to a close-up of the lips, which smile. Cut to a profile of Aang, his face emotionless. Suddenly, a huge centipede-like body arcs around Aang and appears in front of his face. The white, clown-like face of Koh is inches away from Aang. Around the spirit's face are eight additional legs. \n",
      "KOH: [Creepily, circling Aang.] Welcome! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang keeps his face straight. Cut to a long shot; the spirit hangs from the ceiling in front of Aang, who bows with his hands clasped in front of him in a gesture of honor. \n",
      "AANG: [Emotionlessly.] Thank you. [Koh wheels around Aang to look at him from behind. His voice is low and melodic, almost purring.] \n",
      "KOH: My old friend, the Avatar. It's been a long time. \n",
      "AANG: You know me? \n",
      "KOH: [Now facing the camera, away from Aang.] How could I forget [He switches with a \"winking\" effect, as if some sort of nictitating membrane closes briefly over the old face to reveal a new one, to a mad face of a middle-aged, mustached man with thick eyebrows, long mustache, and beard; angrily.] you? One of your previous incarnations tried to slay me! Nearly eight or nine hundred years ago. \n",
      "AANG: [Confused, yet seriously.] I didn't know that. Why did he, or I, try to kill you? \n",
      "KOH: [Switches to Ummi's scared, sad face.] Oh, it was something about stealing the face of someone you loved. [Cut to a close-up of Aang with the camera slowing, zooming in on his face. Cut back to Koh, whose face turns malicious and switches to a baboon's while laughing. Switch to a side-shot; Aang keeps a straight face while not taking his eyes off Koh as he circles around him.] Of course, that's all behind us. Why should I hold a grudge against you for something in a past life? After all, you're a different person now. [Speaks into Aang's ear from behind.] You've come to me ... with a new face. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang closes his eyes and takes a deep breath to the words into his ear, crossing the scene to the real world, Zuko seeing his breath. \n",
      "ZUKO: Guess we'll be here awhile. \n",

      "AANG: I need to find the moon and the ocean. \n",
      "KOH: Their spirit names are Tui and La, push and pull. And that has been the nature of their relationship for all time. \n",
      "AANG: [Side-view of Aang.] Please. Help me find them. An entire culture could be destroyed if I don't get their help. [Top-down view of Koh who changes his face to that of an old man. Aang is visible below him.] \n",
      "KOH: Oh, you think you need their help. [Koh looks to the side.] Actually it's quite the other way round. [In an instant, Koh turns and bolts to Aang, stopping just short of the young Avatar; with an angry blue ogre-like face with red eyes and upright fangs.] Someone's going to kill them! [Aang closes his eyes briefly before opening them to look at Koh.] \n",
      "AANG: What do you mean? How can I find them and protect them? \n",
      "KOH: [Flipping back to his white face.] You've already met them, actually. [View of Koh from behind Aang as Koh moves to look away, turning his back on Aang.] Tui and La, your moon and ocean, have always circled each other in an eternal dance. They balance each other, push and pull, life and death, [Close-up of Aang's face.] good and evil, yin and yang. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang's eyes open wide as he experiences a flashback of the white and black fish circling each other in the pond and the vision he had of them as they turned into the yin and yang symbol just before he entered the Spirit World. Back to Aang. \n",

[Cut to waterbenders attempting to heal Yue as a baby.] Our healers did everything they could. [Panning shot of Yue and the waterbenders, along with Yue's parents.] They told my mother and father I was going to die. [Cut to Arnook staring at the moon.] My father pleaded with the spirits to save me. [Cut to shot panning down from the moon to the oasis.] That night, beneath the full moon, he brought me to the oasis and placed me in the pond.

      "IROH: [Close-up of Iroh while he takes off his hood.] I'm no traitor, Zhao, the Fire Nation needs the moon, too; we all depend on the balance. Whatever you do to that spirit I'll unleash on you ten-fold. Let it go, now! \n",

In it, he is running about the Southern Air Temple. He comes across the room where he had found Monk Gyatso's skeleton in real life and instead sees his own self in the Avatar State. The personage of himself turns to glare at him angrily. Camera cuts to a terrified Aang, wind blowing past him. Cuts to a view of Sokka and Katara huddled behind a rock, watching the Avatar State Aang as he sends a forceful gust of wind that blows the real Aang back. He falls into the room in the Fire Temple he had visited to speak to Roku. The doors to the room open and reveal the personage of Aang in the Avatar State, who breathes fire and splits the floor in half. The real Aang falls through and lands on a Fire Navy ship in the Northern seas. The monstrous koi fish, called Koizilla, created when he and La had fused together during the Siege of the North appears before him, the personage of him inside. The Kozilla makes a downward cutting motion, and the personage does the same before a blinding white appears and the dream ends. Aang awakes from it and leaves the room where the gang is sleeping, exiting through a stairway. Katara awakens and catches sight of him leaving. \n",

      "PAKKU: [Hands Aang box of scrolls.] Aang, these scrolls will help you master waterbending. But remember, they're no substitute for a real master. [Aang looks up at Katara, who is sitting on Appa and looks back.] Sokka ... [Pats him on shoulder, leaving him dismayed.] take care, son. [To the entire gang while pointing out in a direction.] Fly straight to the Earth Kingdom base to the east of here. General Fong will provide you with an escort to Omashu. There, you will be safe to begin your earthbending training with King Bumi. \n",

[Looks at the clearly unhappy Zuko, walks over to him, and sits down on the ground.] I see. It's the anniversary, isn't it? \n",
      "ZUKO: [In a brooding tone.] Three years ago today, I was banished. I lost it all. [Looks up.] I want it back. I want the Avatar, I want my honor, my throne. I want my father not to think I'm worthless. [Looks on regretfully.] \n",
      "IROH: I'm sure he doesn't. Why would he banish you if he didn't care? [Zuko gets up and walks away; he grimaces soon after; to the massagers.] Uh, that came out wrong, didn't it? [They look at each other in confusion.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene switches to a Fire Nation ship. Several men bow as a royal carriage is brought out. Within the carriage is Princess Azula, the daughter of Ozai, niece of Iroh, and sister of Zuko. \n",
      "AZULA: [Stepping out of the carriage and walking down the line of soldiers.] My brother and my uncle have disgraced the Fire Lord, and have brought shame on all of us. You might have mixed feelings about attacking members of the Royal Family. I understand. But I assure you, if you hesitate, I will not hesitate to bring you down. Dismissed. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The soldiers leave. The captain runs up to Azula. \n",
      "CAPTAIN: Princess, I'm afraid the tides will not allow us to bring the ship into port before nightfall. \n",

      "CAPTAIN: I'm afraid I don't understand. \n",

      "CAPTAIN: No, princess. \n",
      "AZULA: And if I were to have you thrown overboard, would the tides think twice about smashing you against the rocky shore? \n",
      "CAPTAIN: [Worried.] No, princess. \n",
      "AZULA: [Runs fingers through her bangs.] Well then, maybe you should worry less about the tides who have already made up their mind about killing you, and worry more about me, who's still mulling it over. [Turns to face the captain angrily.] \n",
      "CAPTAIN: I'll pull us in. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He leaves. Cuts to a close-up of Azula, who glares and narrows her eyes in suspicion. The scene switches to the team flying on Appa. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to inside the base, where General Fong and the team are sitting in a spacious discussion room. \n",
      "FONG: [Camera view depicts entire room.] Avatar Aang, we were all amazed at the stories of how you singlehandedly wiped out an entire Fire Navy fleet at the North Pole. [Closes up to Fong, stroking his beard.] I can't imagine what it feels like to wield such devastating power. It's an awesome responsibility. \n",
      "AANG: [Casually.] I try not to think about it too much. \n",
      "FONG: [Calmly.] Avatar, you're ready to face the Fire Lord now. \n",
      "AANG: [Shocked.] What? No I'm not! \n",
      "KATARA: [Holds out her hand in reasoning.] Aang still needs to master all four elements. \n",
      "FONG: Why? With the kind of power he possesses, power enough to destroy hundreds of battle ships in a matter of minutes, he could defeat the Fire Lord now! \n",
      "SOKKA: But sir, the thing is, Aang can only do those things when he's in the Avatar State. \n",
      "AANG: See, it's this special state where- \n",
      "FONG: [Sharply.] I'm well aware! Your eyes and tattoos glow and you're able to summon unbelievable power. Without you, we'd be slaughtered before we even reach their shores. [Looks at map and guides finger from the location of the base to the location of the Fire Nation Capital.] But with you leading the way, as the ultimate weapon, we could cut a swath right through to the heart of the Fire Nation. \n",
      "AANG: [Doubtfully.] Right, but, I don't know how to get in or out of the Avatar State, much less what to do once I'm there. \n",
      "FONG: So, it's decided then. I'll help you figure out how to get into the Avatar State and then you'll face your destiny. \n",
      "KATARA: [The group rises; angrily.] No, nothing's decided. We already have a plan. Aang's pursuing his destiny his way. \n",
      "FONG: Well, while you take your time learning the elements, the War goes on. May I show you something? [Leads Aang to a window.] That's the infirmary, and those soldiers are the lucky ones. [Several soldiers are injured and walking slowly.] They came back. Every day, the Fire Nation takes lives. People are dying, Aang! You could end it, now. Think about it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang averts his eyes to the side, looking unsure. The scene changes to Azula's ship, where she is training. She stands perfectly straight, holding her fingers in her hand.

      "LO: Almost perfect. \n",
      "LI: One hair out of place. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She repeats her actions, generating lightning again and firing it off into the distance. Cuts to a shot of Iroh, who suddenly awakens from a nap, sits up and peers in curiosity. The scene changes to nightfall at Fong's base. \n",
      "AANG: General Fong? \n",
      "FONG: Come in, Aang. Have you thought about our discussion? \n",
      "AANG: I'm in. I'll fight the Fire Lord. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to where Aang has entered a room with several plain beds, where the team is resting for the night. \n",
      "AANG: [Sits on his bed.] I told the general I'd help him, by going into the Avatar State. \n",
      "KATARA: [Sits up.] Aang, no! This is not the right way! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Resting on his bed with his arms behind his head.] Why not? Remember when he took out the Fire Navy? [Widens his eyes.] He was incredible! \n",
      "KATARA: There's a right way to do this. Practice, study, and discipline! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Casually.] Or just glow it up and stop that Fire Lord! \n",
      "KATARA: [Rises and throws her hands up in surrender.] If you two meat heads want to throw away everything we've worked for, fine, go ahead and glow it up! [Exits.] \n",
      "AANG: Katara, I'm just being realistic! I don't have time to do this the right way! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang casts a mournful look. The scene changes to the next day where Fong, the team, and another soldier are sitting in an outdoor room. The soldier is pouring tea in a cup. \n",
      "SOLDIER: [Drops white food item into the teapot.] This rare chi-enhancing tea is a natural stimulant. In an ordinary warrior, it improves strength and energy ten-fold. In you, it may induce the Avatar State. \n",
      "AANG: Ten-fold energy, huh? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang drinks the tea, causing his eyebrows to twitch slightly. The camera pans downward to the same scene where Aang is riding rapidly on an air scooter, hyper from the energy boost. \n",
      "AANG: [Quickly in a high-pitched voice.] Is it working? Is it working? I can't tell! Somebody tell me if I'm in the Avatar State 'cause I don't have a good view of myself! Am I talking too loud? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sitting on the floor, tired out by Aang's actions.] I guess he could talk the Fire Lord to death. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang hits a pillar and falls backward. The scene switches to where Aang is sitting on the ground, Sokka standing a few feet away. \n",
      "SOKKA: Maybe I can shock you into the Avatar State. \n",
      "AANG: I love surprises! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Camera cuts to view from Aang's perspective, Katara covering his eye with her hands. She uncovers his eyes to reveal Sokka towering over Aang, his head instead replaced with Momo's, who screeches. Aang screams and glances at his arrow tattoos. \n",
      "AANG: [Holding up hands.] Still not glowing. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to view of the entire team as Sokka steps backward, loses his balance and falls to the ground off camera. Fong shakes his head in dismay. The scene changes to a dimly lit room where Aang is standing, wearing an outfit consisting of a Water Tribe cloak, an Earth Kingdom hat with leaves coming out of the top, part of a Fire Nation soldier outfit and what appears to be a belt. \n",
      "ORACLE: You are wearing a ceremonial piece of clothing from each of the bending nations. Now I will join the four elements into one! Water [Pours jug of water into the bowl.], earth [Pours in bowl of dirt.], fire [Takes nearby torch and throws it in.], air! [Releases air gust from wooden contraption.] Four elements together as one! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The oracle raises the bowl and flings the contents at Aang, coating him in mud. \n",
      "AANG: [Annoyed.] This is just mud! \n",
      "ORACLE: [Quizzically.] So ... do you feel anything? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang raises his finger, catching everyone's interest, only to sneeze, causing mud to fly everywhere, coating Fong, Katara, and Sokka. \n",
      "FONG: [Rubs mud from face.] We have to find a way. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to Zuko and Iroh's place of stay, the room dark inside. Several various shells fall from a bag onto the table. The camera pans up to where Iroh is standing at the table, picking up and examining the different shells. \n",
      "IROH: [Holds up one shell.] Look at these magnificent shells! [Picks up a conch.] I'll enjoy these keepsakes for years to come. \n",
      "ZUKO: We don't need any more useless things! You forget, we have to carry everything ourselves now! \n",
      "AZULA: [From the corner, sitting at the table; calmly.] Hello, brother. Uncle. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Angrily.] What are you doing here? \n",
      "AZULA: [Holds up a shell in her hand.] In my country, we exchange a pleasant hello before asking questions. [Rises and walks toward Zuko and Iroh.] Have you become uncivilized so soon, Zuzu? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Angrily.] Don't call me that! \n",
      "IROH: [Clearly upset.] To what do we owe this honor? \n",
      "AZULA: Hmmm ... must be a family trait. Both of you so quick to get to the point. [Breaks the shell she was holding with her fingertips, leaving Iroh angry.] I've come with a message from home. Father's changed his mind. Family is suddenly very important to him. He's heard rumors of plans to overthrow him; treacherous plots. Family are the only ones you can really trust. [Pauses briefly.] Father regrets your banishment. He wants you home. [Silence.] Did you hear me? You should be happy. Excited. Grateful. I just gave you great news. \n",
      "IROH: I'm sure your brother simply needs a moment. \n",
      "AZULA: [Furiously.] Don't interrupt, Uncle! [To Zuko.] I still haven't heard my thank you. [Annoyed.] I'm not a messenger. I didn't have to come all this way. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Surprised.] Father regrets? He ... wants me back? \n",
      "AZULA: I can see you need time to take this in. I'll come to call on you tomorrow. Good evening. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She exits, leaving Zuko to ponder what has just been said. Meanwhile, at Fong's base, Aang and Katara stand on a balcony, the sun setting over the horizon. \n",
      "KATARA: Can we talk about something? \n",
      "AANG: Sure. \n",
      "KATARA: [Cuts to side-shot of Aang and Katara.] Do you remember when we were at the air temple and you found Monk Gyatso's skeleton? It must have been so horrible and traumatic for you. I saw you get so upset that you weren't even you anymore. [Closes up to Katara.] I'm not saying the Avatar State doesn't have incredible and helpful power ... but you have to understand ... for the people who love you, watching you be in that much rage and pain is really scary. \n",
      "AANG: I'm really glad you told me that. But I still need to do this. \n",
      "KATARA: [Upset.] I don't understand. \n",
      "AANG: [Cuts to overall view of Aang and Katara.] No, you don't. Every day, more and more people die. I'm already one hundred years late. Defeating the Fire Lord is the only way to stop this war. I have to try it! \n",
      "KATARA: [Sadly.] I can't watch you do this to yourself. I'm not coming tomorrow. [Begins to exit.] Good night. \n",
      "AANG: [Sadly.] Good night. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to nightfall at Zuko and Iroh's house. Cuts to inside the house. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Packing belongings.] We're going home! After three long years, it's unbelievable! \n",
      "IROH: [Staring out the window thoughtfully.] It is unbelievable. I have never known my brother to regret anything. \n",
      "ZUKO: Did you listen to Azula? Father's realized how important family is to him! [Irritated.] He cares about me! \n",
      "IROH: [Turns to face Zuko and holds out arms in gesture.] I care about you! And if Ozai wants you back, well, I think it may not be for the reasons you imagine. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Turns his back to Iroh.] You don't know how my father feels about me. You don't know anything! \n",
      "IROH: Zuko, I only meant that in our family, things are not always what they seem. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Turns to face Iroh.] I think you are exactly what you seem! A lazy, mistrustful, shallow old man who's always been jealous of his brother! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko walks away, leaving Iroh saddened. Meanwhile, Aang is caught in another dream. The dream takes place in the Southern seas on Zuko's ship, where the Avatar State Aang rises from the water, riding a water vortex, similar to the way Aang did in the beginning of the series. The personage lands on deck and sweeps away the real Aang with waterbending. The personage turns to Zuko and performs the same downward, cutting motion as seen in previous dreams before the dream abruptly ends and Aang awakens. \n",
      "AANG: [Sits up in his bed.] Sokka! Sokka, wake up. \n",
      "SOKKA: Huh? \n",
      "AANG: I don't think we should be trying to bring on the Avatar State. \n",
      "SOKKA: You sure? \n",
      "AANG: Yes. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Nonchalantly.] Okay. \n",
      "AANG: Do you think the general will be mad? \n",
      "SOKKA: What can he say? You're the Avatar. Who knows better than you? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang lies back on his bed, resting his head on his arms. The next morning, we cut back to Zuko, who is getting ready to return home. He descends a stone staircase, carrying his bags. \n",
      "IROH: [Holding up his hand in motion and running down the staircase after Zuko.] Wait! Don't leave without me! \n",
      "ZUKO: [Turns around, smiles and sets down pack.] Uncle! You've changed your mind! \n",
      "IROH: Family sticks together, right? [Lays hand on Zuko's shoulder.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene flashes back to a shot of Zuko's father, Ozai, resting his hand on his son's shoulder years ago. Flashes back to present day. \n",
      "ZUKO: We're finally going home! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He resumes his descent. The camera closes up on Azula's ship sitting in the harbor. Closes up to Iroh, looking on with suspicion. The scene switches to the discussion room in Fong's base. \n",
      "AANG: [Humbly.] The thing is, I don't think we'll ever be able to trigger it on purpose. So I guess that's it. \n",
      "FONG: [Calmly.] You sure I can't change your mind? \n",
      "AANG: I'm sure. I can only reach the Avatar State when I'm in genuine danger. \n",
      "FONG: I see. I was afraid you'd say that. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He blasts his entire desk at Aang using earthbending, sending him soaring across the room. \n",
      "SOKKA: Aang! [Attempts to come to his aid, only to be held down by two soldiers.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The impact sends Aang crashing through the wall and flying out of the building. He breaks his fall with airbending. \n",
      "FONG: [Walks over toward the hole that was created from the impact and points to Aang.] Men! Attack the Avatar! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to a shot of Aang being surrounded by several earthbending soldiers, some riding on ostrich horses. Fong jumps out of the building and hits the ground, sending a rock wave at Aang which sends him back further. \n",
      "AANG: [Alarmed.] What are you doing? \n",
      "FONG: [Slyly.] I believe we're about to get results. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera focuses on soldiers, who prepare to fire large earth coins at Aang using earthbending. Cuts to a shot of Aang, looking nervously about him. The camera zooms out to a shot of him and his attackers before switching to a soldier, who sends an earth coin at him. Aang avoids two oncoming coins and soars in the air parallel to the ground between two more coins that are thrown at him. He lands safely to the ground. \n",
      "AANG: [Looking about cautiously.] I'm not your enemy! I won't fight you! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He jumps into the air as four earth coins are sent his way, crashing into each other. As Aang begins his descent, another earth coin is sent skidding toward him; the coin crashes into one of the four stationery coins. Aang lands on the ground where the coin was standing just moments ago. Two of the other stationery coins are closed together. The camera cuts to a shot of Aang trapped inside the holes of the earth coins, rolling speedily away. An earthbender breaks the coins, crumbling them to bits. Aang lands on the ground, rises and faces the rest of the soldiers.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Sokka, who was being held down by the two soldiers, raises his feet and steps on their bare feet forcefully. The two soldiers release their grip and fall forward onto the ground in pain while Sokka runs away to aid Aang.\n",
      "Outside, Aang narrowly avoids two earth coins sent at him, one flying above him, one flying below him. Two more earth coins are sent from opposite sides of the ring, threatening to crush him. Aang manages to escape by dodging through the holes in the coins just as they collide together and fall to the ground.\n",
      "Riding an air scooter, Aang zigzags past several soldiers who attempt to slow him down by conjuring up rock walls in his path. Two soldiers riding ostrich horses chase after him as Aang rides past and scales up the wall of the base. As he is seen riding up the wall on the air scooter, the two soldiers use earthbending to propel themselves upward. Aang's air scooter runs out of air and he begins running up the wall, the two soldiers following him in hot pursuit. Cuts to a top view of Aang scaling the wall, only to narrowly dodge two spears coming his way.\n",
      "He falls to the ground. The two soldiers land on the wall and descend to the ground after him. Aang somersaults forward as he avoids their spear attacks yet again. He lands onto the ground, an earth coin embedded into it. The earth coin is suddenly sent upward and dragged forward, Aang being trapped in its hole. The earth coin lands in front of Fong. \n",
      "FONG: You can't run forever! \n",
      "AANG: You can't fight forever! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fong leaps forward and crushes the earth coin, just as Aang jumps to avoid the attack. Dust from the impact is sent flying toward the screen. The scene changes to where Zuko and Iroh are approaching Azula's ship. The camera pans upward and focuses on a shot of Azula standing quietly on top of a ramp leading up to the ship. Royal Procession guards stand on either side of them as they walk, forming an aisle. Iroh averts his eyes suspiciously between the guards. They reach the ship and bow; the guards behind them walk forward and close the aisle. \n",
      "AZULA: Brother! Uncle! Welcome! I'm so glad you decided to come. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera cuts to a side-shot of Iroh, opening his eyes slightly and casting a suspicious glance at the guards. \n",
      "CAPTAIN: Are we ready to depart, Your Highness? \n",
      "AZULA: [Sweetly.] Set our course for home, captain. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Wistfully.] Home. \n",
      "CAPTAIN: [He walks up the ramp with Zuko and Iroh following him and raises his hand in gesture.] You heard the princess! Raise the anchors! We're taking the prisoners home! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The captain widens his eyes in realization at his mistake and looks at Azula. Zuko and Iroh stop, looking surprised. Cut to Azula with a look of surprise on her face. The camera rushes to her face as her expression turns to fury. Cut back to the captain, his eyes wide. \n",
      "CAPTAIN: [Nervously.] Your Highness, I ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Zuko, his eyes widening. Cuts to a close-up of Iroh, who narrows his eyes to the left and suddenly begins attacking the guards. He pushes them off the edge of the walkway and sends fire blasts their way. Cuts to a side-shot of Zuko, as he stomps furiously up the ramp and throws the captain off. \n",
      "ZUKO: You lied to me! [Cut to Azula, who appears confident.] \n",
      "AZULA: [Smugly.] Like I've never done that before. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She turns her back to him and walks away, as two guards standing near her shoot fire blasts at Zuko. Zuko crosses his arms and spreads them outward, deflecting the attacks and shouts as he charges onto the ship. The scene changes to Aang, who avoids three earth coins that slam onto the ground, threatening to crush him. He runs to the left of the screen as another coin rolls his way. The scene changes to the team's bedroom, where Katara is lying on her bed, listening to the noises outside. \n",
      "KATARA: I wonder what crazy thing they're trying to do now. [Momo, who is sleeping on a pillow, raises his head before going back to sleep. Katara hears another rumble outside and grows worried.] Maybe we should just make sure Aang's okay. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She rises from her bed. The camera cuts to a shot of the base tower and pans downward to show Katara and Sokka running down opposite stairways. They meet up at the bottom of the base. \n",
      "KATARA: [Frantically.] What's going on? \n",
      "SOKKA: The general's gone crazy! He's trying to force Aang into the Avatar State! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka pulls out his boomerang and throws it as Katara runs off. Cuts to a shot of a soldier, who is hit by the boomerang and falls to the ground in a daze, knocking over the earth coin in the process. Cuts to Aang, who is being chased by another soldier mounted on an ostrich horse. The head of the spear the soldier was holding is suddenly snapped off. He slows down, stunned at this. Cuts to a shot of Katara summoning a water whip. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Approaching the ostrich horse carefully.] Good ... bird ... horse thingy ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka mounts it and the animal begins galloping away, leaving Katara standing in the arena. The camera zooms out to Fong. Several earth coins are summoned, rolling toward Katara before coming to a standstill. \n",
      "FONG: [Looking back at Aang, who has managed to escape up a stairway.] Maybe you can avoid me ... but she can't. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The soldiers rotate the earth coins so that their flat sides face Katara. The camera zooms out to the entire arena, the coins forming a triangular pattern around Katara. The waterbender sends a water whip at Fong, who summons up dust pillars that deflect the water and turn it to mud. He uses earthbending to begin sinking her into the ground. She twists around, buried knee deep. \n",
      "KATARA: [Struggling to break free.] I can't move! \n",
      "AANG: [Worried; clenches his fists.] Don't hurt her! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He leaps onto the ground and sends a gust of wind at Fong, who summons an earth wall to block the attack. Fong brings down the earth wall and sinks Katara into the ground further, this time burying her waist deep. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Riding the ostrich horse.] Katara! No! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He gallops toward her, but Fong sinks the animal's feet into the ground, flinging Sokka off the ostrich horse. Sokka slams into the hole of an earth coin, leaving him dangling. \n",
      "AANG: [Desperately and clutching onto Fong's arm.] Stop this! You have to let her go! \n",
      "FONG: You could save her if you were in the Avatar State! \n",
      "AANG: [Tears forming around his eyes.] I'm trying ... I'm trying! \n",
      "KATARA: [Frantically.] Aang, I'm sinking! [Twists around again and is buried chest deep.] \n",
      "FONG: [Demanding.] I don't see glowing! [Lowers his right arm and begins closing his hand into a fist; Katara becomes buried neck deep.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Desperately.] Please! \n",
      "AANG: [Falling to his knees, begging.] You don't need to do this! \n",
      "FONG: [Scornfully.] Apparently, I do. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He clenches his fist tight, sinking Katara completely. She cries out in fear before being completely buried in the ground. Aang leaps forward and attempts to save her, however, he falls short. Closes up on Aang, as his arrow tattoo begins to glow a bright white. He turns his head to face Fong, the Avatar State now triggered. \n",
      "FONG: [Triumphantly.] It worked! It worked! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: An air blast is sent his way and his triumphant expression soon becomes one of fear as he realizes the situation. Cuts to Aang, who performs the downward cutting motion as seen in his previous dreams and pushes Fong back with a powerful air blast. Fong lands roughly on the ground. Cuts to Aang, who begins rising on an earth vortex.\n",
      "The scene changes to Zuko, who leaps onto the deck of the ship and blasts the two guards off the ship with two fire blasts. He lands on deck. The camera zooms out to where Azula is standing patiently several feet away, her back turned to him. Focuses on Azula, who smirks. Cuts to Zuko, who clenches his fists and prepares fire daggers. Cuts to Iroh, who continues to attack the guards on the walkway. \n",
      "IROH: [Pushes several guards away; grabs one and wrestles him.] Zuko! Let's go! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He hurls the guard over the edge and steps to the side to avoid another guard's attack and push him aside. Cuts back to Zuko, who charges at Azula with fire daggers. Zooms out to where he attempts to strike Azula, only for the princess to acutely dodge all of his blows. Cuts to close-up of her as she smirks at her brother. Zooms out to both siblings as Zuko keeps attacking and Azula keeps avoiding. Zuko brings down his right hand to land another blow, however, Azula manages to push him away. \n",
      "AZULA: You know, Father blames Uncle for the loss of the North Pole. And he considers you a miserable failure for not finding the Avatar! [Cuts to Zuko, who is panting heavily.] Why would he want you back home, except to lock you up [Cuts back to Azula.] where you can no longer embarrass him? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko conjures up two fire daggers again. He leaps into the air and sends a powerful fire blast at Azula using his foot. She jumps and lands safely on the deck several feet away. Zuko charges at her as she rises to her feet. After dodging several more attacks, she manages to scrape his forehead with her fingernails, leaving three scratch marks on his temple. Zuko falls back a few feet from the impact and yells as he charges at her again.\n",
      "The two continue to duel, eventually making their way up a stairway that leads to the central control area of the ship. Azula manages grab hold of Zuko's arm. A few seconds pause as the two stand silently, Zuko widening his eyes in alarm. Cuts to a side-shot of the stairway where Azula knocks him to his feet with a blue fire blast. Zuko lands roughly at the bottom of the stairwell. Cuts to a shot from Zuko's perspective, the screen slightly blurred to show the effects of the blow. The camera travels upward from side to side before landing on Azula, who moves both her arms in a circular motion, generating lightning. Cuts to shot of her readying the attack and firing the bolt at her brother, only for Iroh to step in suddenly, grab hold of her right hand and redirect the lightning, causing it to strike a far-off cliff side. He bends her downward and kicks her off the ship. Azula lands in the water below with a splash. Cuts to Zuko and Iroh, who run away from the ship.\n",
      "The scene changes to Fong's base, where Aang is rising on the earth vortex, still under the control of the Avatar State. \n",
      "FONG: [Pleading.] Avatar Aang! Can you hear me? Your friend is safe! [Brings Katara back above ground; cuts to close-up of her as she looks up at Aang in misery.] It was just a trick to trigger the Avatar State ... [Cuts back to Fong, who smiles maniacally.] and it worked! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang swivels about on the vortex and lands on the ground forcefully, causing a flurry of dust to spread. Fong is sent back several feet while Katara remains rooted to the ground where she was. Cuts to the left of the arena where several soldiers are standing, a torrent of dust rumbling their way. The dust clears to reveal the ground broken and in ruins. Cuts to right of the arena, where several soldiers on ostrich horses stand. The dust torrent passes over them and clears, revealing that side in ruins. Cuts to another area of the base, where several houses lie. Again, the torrent passes over, leaving the houses considerably damaged.\n",

He is seen rapidly riding atop the wave toward the screen. Cuts to Avatar Yangchen, who stands in a grassy field surrounded by a forest area. Her eyes glow briefly as she swings her arms and swivels around, conjuring powerful winds. The camera zooms out to the entire field and the forest blown violently by the wind. \n",

      "AANG: What do you mean? \n",
      "ROKU: If you are killed in the Avatar State, [The figures of him and the Avatars in the background are blown away like dust.] the reincarnation cycle will be broken [Shows the line of Avatars with Aang standing at the end; the Avatars begin to fade away in succession down the line.] and the Avatar will cease to exist. \n",

      "AANG: [Embracing her; regretfully.] I'm sorry, Katara. I hope you never have to see me like that again. \n",
      "FONG: [Triumphantly.] Ha! Are you joking? That was almost perfect! [Thoughtfully.] We just have to find out a way to control you when you're like that. \n",
      "AANG: [Slightly angry.] You're out of your mind. \n",
      "FONG: I guess we'll figure it out on the way to the Fire Nation. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka appears behind the general, riding the ostrich horse. He raises his club and strikes the general on the head, which knocks him out cold. \n",
      "SOKKA: Anybody got a problem with that? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The soldiers shake their heads. Zooms out to the gang, several soldiers and Fong, who lies on the ground motionless. \n",
      "SOLDIER: Do you still want an escort to Omashu? \n",
      "KATARA: [Casts the group a look of annoyance.] I think we're all set. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The group leaves the base on Appa. The scene changes to the village resort. Azula is seen standing on the balcony of one of the residential buildings. Two Royal Procession guards stand in the background to protect her. \n",
      "AZULA: [Holds up wanted poster of her brother and uncle.] Anyone who harbors these traitors will face the wrath of the Fire Lord! [She lays a hand on the balcony, causing the two massagers to cower in fear; cuts to close-up of her.] There will be no place left to hide! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to a riverside. The shadowy reflections of two figures on the run can be seen in the water. Cuts to view of the river bank and the area nearby as Zuko and Iroh run frantically. Cuts to riverbank as the two stop and fall to the ground, catching their breath. \n",
      "IROH: I think we're safe here. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot from Zuko's perspective as he pulls out a small dagger. Cuts to close-up of Zuko holding the dagger, its blade reflecting the sunlight. Cuts briefly to Iroh, who closes his eyes, seemingly aware of his nephew's actions. He casts a look at Zuko, who holds the knife under his ponytail. Cuts to close-up of his ponytail, as he slices it off with the knife. He holds it in his hand and looks at it for a moment before passing the knife to Iroh, who cuts off his topknot. Cuts to Zuko's hand, as he releases his ponytail. Cuts to the surface of the river, as the two topknots are released and float down the river. The camera zooms out to where Zuko and Iroh stand quietly on the bank of the river. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fades to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens to show a cliff with a small body of water, where Team Avatar is residing. The camera pans downward and cuts to where Sokka is relaxing peacefully, floating on a large leaf in the water with Momo sleeping on his stomach, while Katara and Aang are facing each other while practicing waterbending. \n",
      "SOKKA: [With his hair covering his eyes.] You guys are going to be done soon, right? We have a lot of ground to cover if we're going to make it to Omashu today. \n",
      "KATARA: [Rises from her hunched-over position; turns to face Sokka smugly.] What? Like you're ready to go right now, naked guy? [Smiles at him smugly.] \n",
      "SOKKA: I could be ready in two minutes. Seriously, [Pulls back the hair covering his eyes.] whenever. \n",
      "AANG: So you were showing me the octopus form? \n",
      "KATARA: [Turns her attention back to Aang.] Right, let me see your stance. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang assumes a defensive stance. After careful consideration, Katara walks over to him. \n",
      "KATARA: [Walks under his right arm.] Your arms are too far apart. [Positions his arms closer together.] See, if you move them closer together, you protect your center. You got it? \n",
      "AANG: [Blushing.] Oh, yea ... thanks. \n",
      "KATARA: [Walks away and assumes a fighting stance.] Okay, let's see what you got. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang bends the water, creating a globule which eventually transforms into eight whip-like water tentacles. He carefully maneuvers them, fending off shards of ice that Katara repeatedly sends at him by throwing them away or dodging them. At length, he manipulates one of the tentacles, curling it around her leg, gripping it firmly and pulling on it. \n",
      "KATARA: [Proudly.] You make a fine octopus, Pupil Aang. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera cuts to where Aang dances playfully, suspended in a globule of water shaped like an actual octopus. Suddenly, music can be heard in the distance. The group witnesses a strange group of nomads playing music on instruments and singing, approaching them. \n",
      "CHONG: [Singing.] Da, da, da. Don't fall in love with the traveling girl. She'll leave you broke and brokenhearted. [Cuts to shot of the team standing in the lake. Sokka unexpectedly falls off his leaf into the water. Cuts to nomads. Chong stops singing and points at the group.] Hey, river people! \n",
      "KATARA: We're not river people. \n",
      "CHONG: [Puzzled.] You're not? Well then what kind of people are you? \n",
      "AANG: Just ... people. \n",
      "CHONG: Aren't we all, brother? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Walks over and says accusingly.] Who are you? \n",
      "CHONG: I'm Chong and this is my wife, Lily. We're nomads, happy to go wherever the wind takes us! [He suddenly strums his lute-like instrument in a crazy fashion much like a rock star strums crazily on their guitar.] \n",
      "AANG: [Starts out with a somewhat puzzled tone, but changes it to an excited one.] You guys are nomads? That's great! I'm a nomad! \n",
      "CHONG: [Just as excitedly.] Hey, me too! \n",
      "AANG: [Blankly.] I know ... you just said that. \n",
      "CHONG: Oh. [Noticing Sokka.] Nice underwear ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to close shot of Sokka, who is only wearing his swimsuit; Aang and Katara are standing behind him. Sokka's eyes bulge at the sudden realization that he is wearing very little in front of complete strangers. He grabs Momo and places him strategically over his underwear and slides rapidly off the screen. The scene switches to a forest landscape, where Zuko and Iroh are now living as fugitives. The camera shows a close-up of Iroh's face, as he gasps and stares in awe at a red and white flower. Cuts to full view of him and an area behind him. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Emerging from the bushes, now sporting short, black hair.] I didn't find anything to eat! I can't live like this! I wasn't meant to be a fugitive. [Raises fists in the air and yells at the sky.] This is impossible! [Looking over at Iroh.] Uncle, what are you doing? \n",
      "IROH: [Cuts to Iroh who dotes over the flower. Zuko appears behind him.] You're looking at the rare white dragon bush. Its leaves make a tea so delicious, it's heartbreaking. That, or it's the white jade, which is poisonous. \n",
      "ZUKO: We need food, not tea. I'm going fishing. [Walks away.] \n",
      "IROH: [Dreamily.] Hmm ... delectable tea? [More suspiciously.] Or deadly poison? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene switches to where Team Avatar and the band of nomads are lounging nearby Appa, whose fur is braided. Chong is casually strumming his lute. Sokka approaches. \n",
      "AANG: [Wearing a wreath of pink flowers on his head.] Hey, Sokka, you should hear some of these stories. These guys have been everywhere! \n",
      "CHONG: [Stops playing.] Well not everywhere, Little Arrowhead. But where we haven't been, we've heard about through stories and songs. \n",
      "AANG: They said they'll take us to see a giant night crawler! \n",
      "MOKU: [Lying on the ground; in a dreamy voice.] On the way, there's a waterfall that creates a never-ending rainbow! \n",
      "SOKKA: Look, I hate to be the wet blanket here, but since Katara is busy, I guess it's up to me. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara shoots him a glare as Lily braids her hair. \n",
      "SOKKA: We need to get to Omashu. No sidetracks, no worms and definitely no rainbows. \n",
      "CHONG: Wow, sounds like someone has a case of destination fever. You're worried too much about where you're going. \n",
      "LILY: You got to focus less on the \"where\" and more on the \"going\". [She makes gestures with her hand, accidentally tugging on Katara's braid.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Impatiently.] O. Ma. Shu! \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka's right. We need to find King Bumi, so Aang can learn earthbending somewhere safe. \n",
      "CHONG: Sounds like you're headed to Omashu. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka smacks his forehead in frustration. \n",
      "CHONG: There's an old story about a secret pass right through the mountains. \n",
      "KATARA: Is this real or a legend? \n",
      "CHONG: Oh, it's a real legend. And it's as old as earthbending itself. [Begins strumming his lute and singing.] Two lovers, forbidden from one another, the war divides their people and the mountain divides them apart! Built a path to be together! [Stops playing.] Yeah, I forget the next couple of lines, but then it goes ... [Resumes singing.] Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Through the mountains, secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel! Yeah! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A shot showing everyone around Appa, including the nomads. who had been dancing and clapping. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Unamused while folding his arms.] I think we'll just stick with flying. We've dealt with the Fire Nation before. We'll be fine. \n",
      "AANG: Yeah, thanks for the help, but Appa hates going underground. [Flashing a smile.] And we need to do whatever makes Appa most comfortable ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to a mountainous cliffside where Fire Nation soldiers are attacking the team by launching fireballs at them as they desperately try to escape on Appa. \n",
      "COMMANDER: [Pointing at the trio on Appa.] Launch! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Several catapults are activated, launching an assault of fireballs at the team, who manages to narrowly avoid them. \n",
      "TEAM.AVATAR: Ahhhh! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to the trio, covered in ash and scorch marks, casually strolling past the nomads. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Pointing forward.] Secret love cave, let's go. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene switches to the forest, where Zuko has arrived from his fishing expedition. When the camera pans upward, it is revealed that he has only managed to spear a single, tiny fish which flaps about helplessly on the large branch he used for a fishing pole. Cuts to Iroh hunched over, his back to the camera. \n",
      "IROH: Zuko, [Cut to a wide, overhead shot of Zuko standing behind Iroh.] remember that plant I thought might be tea? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Shocked.] You didn't ... \n",
      "IROH: I did ... [Turns around.] and it wasn't. [Reveals himself to be swollen and covered in red marks.] \n",
      "ZUKO: [Cut back to Zuko who drops the branch out of shock.] Ahh! \n",
      "IROH: [Surprisingly calmly.] When the rash spreads to my throat, I will stop breathing. [Excitedly.] But look what I found. [Iroh holds out his arm to reveal berries.] These are bacui berries, known to cure the poison of the white jade. [Unenthusiastically.] That, or maka'ole berries that cause blindness. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Grabbing branch of berries and hurling it into the bushes.] We're not taking any more chances with these plants! We need to get help. \n",
      "IROH: But where are we going to go? [Kneeling down and scratching his rash vigorously.] We're enemies of the Earth Kingdom and fugitives from the Fire Nation. [Camera zooms in on his reddened leg.] \n",
      "ZUKO: If the Earth Kingdom discovers us, they'll have us killed. \n",
      "IROH: [Rises.] But if the Fire Nation discovers us, we'll be turned over to Azula. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They look at each other and pause briefly. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Nodding and walking away with Iroh.] Earth Kingdom it is. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to where Team Avatar and the band of nomads are journeying to the tunnels along a wide street surrounded by the ruins of a temple. \n",
      "SOKKA: How far are we from the tunnel? \n",
      "CHONG: Actually, it's not just one tunnel. The lovers didn't want anyone to find out about their love, so they built a whole labyrinth! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Halts in his tracks; in shock.] Labyrinth? \n",
      "CHONG: [Casually.] Oh, I'm sure we'll figure it out. \n",
      "LILY: All you need to do is trust in love ... according to the curse. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka, who had resumed walking, halts once more. The others pass by him. After several moments, he flinches in terror. \n",
      "SOKKA: [In a somewhat whining voice.] Curse! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Camera pans to the dark entrance of the cave. \n",
      "CHONG: Hey-hey! We're here! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Cuts to shot of inscription on the side of the cave entrance.] What exactly is this curse? \n",
      "CHONG: The curse says that only those who trust in love can make it through the caves. Otherwise, you'll be trapped in them forever. \n",
      "LILY: And die. \n",
      "CHONG: Oh yeah, and die. [Brightening.] Hey, I just remembered the rest of that song! [Stands before the entrance and strums lute, while singing an ominous line in a low voice.] And die! \n",
      "SOKKA: That's it! There's no way we're going through some cursed hole! \n",
      "MOKU: [Turns head to observe gray smoke rising from the horizon, which he proceeds to point at.] Hey, someone's making a big campfire! \n",
      "KATARA: [In a serious tone.] That's no campfire, Moku. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Grimly.] It's Fire Nation. They're tracking us. \n",
      "AANG: [Making sure he understands.] So all you need to do is trust in love to get through these caves? \n",
      "CHONG: That is correct, Master Arrowhead. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang turns to stare at Katara, who has her back to him. Her clothes and hair sway slightly as a breeze passes by. The camera closes up to his face, his eyes shining in adoration. \n",
      "AANG: [Smiling.] We can make it. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Gesturing to the cave; somewhat commanding.] Everyone into the hole! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They all begin to enter the cave. Cuts to a close-up of Appa as he groans. Several Fire Nation tanks rumble across the terrain toward the entrance of the tunnel and pause once they reach the mouth of the cave. \n",
      "COMMANDER: Hold on! It's too dangerous. Haven't you heard the song? Just close them in. The mountain will take care of the rest. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The tanks fire rotating grappling hooks from canisters into the tunnel and release them after a few moments, unleashing a myriad of boulders. The scene switches to where the group has begun navigating their way through the tunnels only to turn and witness the entrance being closed off. Appa begins to frantically paw the walls of the tunnel. \n",
      "KATARA: It's okay, Appa. We'll be fine. I hope. \n",
      "SOKKA: We will be fine. All we need is a plan. Chong, how long do those torches last? \n",
      "CHONG: [Casually.] Uh, about two hours each. \n",
      "LILY: [Lighting the rest of the torches in her hand.] And we have five torches, so that's ten hours! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Grabbing torches and stomping out the fire.] It doesn't work like that if they're all lit at the same time! \n",
      "LILY: Oh, right. \n",
      "SOKKA: I'm going to make a map to keep track of exactly where we've been. Then we should be able to solve it like a maze and get through. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara and Aang look at each other with unsure expressions. The scene changes to a village. Camera cuts to a hospital before switching to the inside of the building. One doctor is treating a man with what appears to be a cupping treatment. The man grits his teeth in pain. The camera pans over to where a girl is treating Iroh's allergic reaction. Zuko is seated on a bench. \n",
      "SONG: [Wringing cloth.] You two must not be from around here. We know better than to touch the White Jade, much less make it into tea and drink it. [Flicks Iroh's hand away when he scratches his rash.] \n",
      "IROH: [The girl moves away from the camera's eye, revealing Iroh to be in an even worse condition than before with the rash having spread to his face and his cheeks swollen.] Whoops! \n",
      "SONG: So where are you traveling from? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Nervously; rises from his seat as she moves his hand down so she could wash it.] Yes, we're travelers. \n",
      "SONG: Do you have names? \n",
      "ZUKO: Names? Of course we have names. [Song turns to see Iroh scratching and glares at him, before slapping his hand away.] I'm, uh ... Lee and this is my Uncle, uh ... Mushi? \n",
      "IROH: [Shoots him angry look. Cuts to shot of Song taking a lotion from a jar. She begins slathering it over the inflamed areas.] Yes, my nephew was named after his father, so we just call him Junior. [Leans over to the side to give Zuko a pleased smile.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko glares angrily at Iroh and moves his finger across his neck signaling that he's dead meat, but abruptly halts and puts his hands behind his back when Song turns to look at him. \n",
      "SONG: Mushi and Junior, huh. My name is Song. You two look like you could use a good meal. [Slaps Iroh's hand away when he goes to scratch his rash.] Why don't you stay for dinner? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Looking away.] Sorry, but we need to be moving on. \n",
      "SONG: [Screwing the cap back on the lid.] That's too bad. [Gives an innocent smile.] My mom always makes too much roast duck. \n",
      "IROH: [Excitedly.] Where do you live exactly? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to the dark tunnel where Sokka is standing with a map in his hands, the map taking up most of the screen. He tilts it to the side a few times before drawing it closer to him. \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka, this is the tenth dead end you've led us to. \n",
      "SOKKA: This doesn't make sense. We already came through this way. \n",
      "CHONG: We don't need a map. [Sokka passes by him.] We just need love. The little guy knows it. \n",
      "AANG: Yeah, but I wouldn't mind a map also. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Cuts to an overhead shot of the group standing in the dark cave before switching to Sokka who looks up from the map.] There's something strange here. There's only one explanation. [Cuts to shot of the rest of the group before switching to Sokka who turns to face the camera.] The tunnels are changing. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A wave of surprise passes over everyone as the tunnels shake. The scene cuts to nighttime to a house. Cuts to a shot of an open-wall dining room where Zuko and Iroh are sitting around Song's kitchen table. \n",
      "SONG'S.MOTHER: [Setting down a platter of roast duck and taking a seat.] My daughter tells me you're refugees. We were once refugees ourselves. \n",
      "SONG: [Sadly.] When I was a little girl, the Fire Nation raided our farming village. All the men were taken away. That was the last time I saw my father. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Close-up of the prince.] I haven't seen my father in many years. \n",
      "SONG: [Sorrowfully.] Oh, is he fighting in the War? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko hesitates. Iroh is seen slurping up a bowl of noodles. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Sets down dish.] Yeah. [Looks away in dismay.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to the cave. \n",
      "CHONG: [Frantically.] The tunnels, they're a-changin'. It must be the curse! I knew we shouldn't have come down here! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sarcastically.] Right, if only we listened to you. \n",
      "KATARA: [Hold up a hand in warning.] Everyone be quiet. Listen. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of Sokka looking into the dark tunnel, his back to the camera. A low snarl can be heard from within the darkness of the tunnel. Momo flees from his shoulder. Sokka suspiciously holds the torch up to the tunnel to inspect the strange sound. Suddenly, a wolfbat flies from the darkness of the cave toward the camera, causing everyone to panic. \n",
      "CHONG: It's a giant flying thing with teeth! \n",
      "MOKU: [The creature lands. Off-camera.] No! It's a wolfbat! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The wolfbat takes off again. In a frenzy, Sokka swats at the creature with the lit torch. Several hot cinders are thrown about and land on Appa's skin. Yelping in pain, the bison begins running around the tunnel, releasing a discharge of rocks and debris. Aang quickly airbends Sokka and the band of nomads out of the way of the falling rocks. He races toward Katara and pushes her out of the way. The camera cuts to where he and Katara rise from the impact and witness the division of the tunnel. Meanwhile, Sokka attempts to dig his way through the barrier that divides the two groups. \n",
      "CHONG: Yeah, it's no use. We're separated. But at least you have us! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Horrified.] Nooooo! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He resumes digging through the rocks only to have a pile of debris fall on him. The scene changes to where Zuko is sitting on Song's front porch. Song comes outside and sits beside him. \n",
      "SONG: Can I join you? I know what you've been through. We've all been through it. [Witnessing Zuko's scar.] The Fire Nation has hurt you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She reaches out to touch his scar only to have Zuko push her hand away. \n",
      "SONG: [Compassionately.] It's okay. They've hurt me, too. [Pulls up pants leg to reveal burn scars on her leg.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko casts her a surprised look upon seeing this. The scene cuts to where Chong and his group are singing much to Sokka's annoyance. \n",
      "CHONG: [Singing as he and the nomads pass the angry warrior.] Oh, don't let the cave-in get you down! [Cuts to shot of him.] Don't let the falling rocks turn your smile into a frown! [He goes off-screen and Moku passes by, nudging Sokka.] When the tunnels are darkest, that's when you need a clown, hey! [Re-enters.] Don't let the cave-in get you down, Sokka! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka scowls at this. The scene changes to Aang and Katara who are making their way through the tunnels. \n",
      "KATARA: [Cheerfully.] Aang, look! \n",
      "AANG: [Running up to a solid rock door.] We found the exit! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two struggle to open it. Appa is seen in the background, snorting and preparing to charge. The two look at each other in alarm before running away as Appa charges at the door forcefully. Cuts to the opposite side of the entrance as the door creaks open and to a wider shot of the room as the stone doorway loosens and rolls off to the side. Katara jumps into the room only to have her look of hope change into one of disappointment. \n",
      "KATARA: This isn't the exit. \n",
      "AANG: [Walking to her side.] No. It's a tomb. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera zooms out on the ominous looking tomb, Appa grunting behind the duo. \n",
      "AANG: It must be the two lovers from the legend; that's who's buried here. \n",
      "KATARA: These pictures tell their story. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara gestures with the torch toward at the panels along the tomb, speaking about each one in turn. Aang and Katara exchanged glances and Katara narrates the story. The first image is that of a mountain. \n",
      "KATARA: [Voice-over.] They met on top of the mountain that divided their two villages ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Two figures, a man dressed in red and a woman in blue, meet atop the mountain. They take each other's hands, though they swiftly let go, and a Chinese character appears. \n",
      "KATARA: [Voice-over.] The villages were enemies, so they could not be together ... [Character flashes red as the background turns grim and dark.] but their love was strong and they found a way. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Two hills appear; on the closer one is the man, while the woman kneels on the one farther away. Though their faces cannot be seen in detail, it is obvious that they long for the other. \n",
      "KATARA: [Voice-over.] The two lovers learned earthbending from the badgermoles; they became the first earthbenders. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The painting of a badgermole is shown, as well as that of the young couple beginning to create the labyrinth. \n",
      "KATARA: [Voice-over.] They built elaborate tunnels, so they could meet secretly. [The pattern of a labyrinth appears.] Anyone who tried to follow them would be forever in the labyrinth. [The couple kisses.] But, one day, the man didn't come [Cuts to a shot of the woman alone, looking startled.] - he'd died in the war between the two villages. [Arrows fly by the screen. The woman is seen weeping by a grave.] Devastated, the woman unleashed a terrible display of her earthbending power - she could have destroyed them all ... [The woman is seen displaying her immense earthbending power.] but, instead, she declared the war over. [Cuts to shot of the woman standing on a hill surrounded by the two villages.] Both villages helped her build a new city where they would live together in peace. [Shows picture of the current-day Omashu.] The woman's name was Oma and the man's name was Shu. [The characters for \"Oma\" appear followed by the character for \"Shu\". Flashback ends.] The great city was named Omashu as a monument to their love. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two look at each other momentarily before turning around. \n",
      "KATARA: [Reading the inscription on the relief in the wall.] Love is brightest [Cuts to shot of a carving of the couple kissing.] in the dark. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Meanwhile, on the other side of the cave, Sokka glares at the map while Momo comically perches on the top of his head. The map takes up most of the shot until Sokka lowers it. \n",
      "MOKU: Oh, great! Your plans have led us to another dead end! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to overhead shot of the entire group standing before a wall of rubble, before switching to Sokka and Moku, with Sokka glaring accusingly at the nomad. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Defensively.] At least I'm thinking of ideas and trying to get us out of here, Moku. \n",
      "CHONG: Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. We're thinking of ideas‌? Because I've had an idea for, like, an hour now. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Angrily; spreads arms out dramatically.] Yes! We're all thinking of ideas! \n",
      "CHONG: Well, then listen to this: If love is the key out of here, then all we need to do is play a love song! [Begins playing song much to Sokka's dismay.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Meanwhile, in the tomb of the two lovers, Katara studies the portrait of the two lovers and the inscription while Aang stands off to side. \n",
      "AANG: How are we going to find our way out of these tunnels? \n",
      "KATARA: I have a crazy idea. \n",
      "AANG: [Curiously.] What? \n",
      "KATARA: [Hesitant. Walks away, slightly embarrassed.] Never mind. It's too crazy. \n",
      "AANG: Katara, what is it? \n",
      "KATARA: I was thinking ... the curse says we'll be trapped in here forever unless we trust in love ... \n",
      "AANG: Right ... \n",
      "KATARA: [Turns to face him and gestures to the portrait.] And here, it says, \"Love is brightest in the dark,\" and has a picture of them kissing. \n",
      "AANG: [Utterly confused and lost.] Where are you going with this? \n",
      "KATARA: [Shyly, blushing.] Well, what if we ... kissed? \n",
      "AANG: [Very surprised.] Us ... kissing‌? \n",
      "KATARA: See? It was a crazy idea. \n",
      "AANG: [Dreamily.] Us ... kissing ... \n",
      "KATARA: [Fake-jokingly.] Us kissing. What was I thinking? Can you imagine that‌? \n",
      "AANG: [Fake-jokingly.] Yeah. [Awkwardly laughs.] I definitely wouldn't want to kiss you! [Beat.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Insulted.] Oh, well! I didn't realize it was such a horrible option. [Angrily.] Sorry I suggested it! \n",
      "AANG: [Realizing his mistake.] No, no, I mean ... if there was a choice between kissing you and dying ... \n",
      "KATARA: [Disgusted.] Ugh! \n",
      "AANG: [Desperately.] What? I'm saying is I would rather kiss you than die - that's a compliment. \n",
      "KATARA: [Enraged.] Well, I'm not sure which I'd rather do! [Slams the torch into his hand and storms away.] \n",
      "AANG: [Miserably.] What is wrong with me ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He walks away, the screen darkening in his wake. The scene changes to where Chong and his nomads are playing love songs, the camera panning down to show the group walking past. \n",
      "CHONG: [Singing.] Even if you're lost, you can't lose the love because it's in your heart ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka slaps his forehead once more. The scene changes where we now see Zuko and Iroh preparing to depart from Song's house. They stand outside, dozens of fireflies in the air. \n",
      "IROH: Thank you for the duck. It was excellent. \n",
      "SONG'S.MOTHER: You're welcome. It brings me pleasure to see someone eat my cooking with such ... gusto. \n",
      "IROH: [Pats his stomach in a contented manner.] Much practice. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko turns to leave. \n",
      "IROH: Junior, where are your manners? You need to thank these nice people. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Turns and bows.] Thank you. \n",
      "SONG: I know you don't think there's any hope left in the world, but there is hope. The Avatar has returned. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Bitterly.] I know. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He leaves, but stops as he comes across an ostrich horse. Quietly, he walks over to the animal, unfastens it from its post and leads it away. The camera cuts to a shot from Song's front yard. Zuko appears on screen, riding the animal. \n",
      "IROH: What are you doing? These people just showed you great kindness. \n",
      "ZUKO: They're about to show us a little more kindness. Well? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Disappointed and reluctant, Iroh mounts the ostrich horse and the two ride away, leaving Song upset. She quietly closes the screen door to the house. The scene switches to the cave where Aang and Katara are still wandering about hopelessly, their torch ready to burn out at any moment. \n",
      "AANG: We're going to run out of light any second now, aren't we? \n",
      "KATARA: I think so ... \n",
      "AANG: Then, what are we going to do? \n",
      "KATARA: What can we do? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She silently walks over and grabs hold of his hand. Aang smiles up at her. The camera cuts to a close-up of Katara's face. The two are seen leaning into one another as the last of the torch light fades. Suddenly, the ceiling of the cave lights up revealing thousands of glowing crystals gleaming overhead. Meanwhile, Sokka and the band of nomads are journeying through the cave when they hear low growls. The camera zooms in on a dark tunnel where several wolfbats come into the light, racing toward them. Sokka waves his hands frantically in an attempt to scare them off. The creatures fly straight past him. \n",
      "CHONG: Hey! You saved us, Sokka! \n",
      "SOKKA: No, they were trying to get away from something! \n",
      "CHONG: From what? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The caves rumble. Cuts to an overhead shot of the group as a wall of rock crumbles. Without warning, two giant badgermoles burst through the caves, causing the group to panic. One badgermole closes its hands together in a prayerful manner, closing off a tunnel behind it with earthbending. The camera shifts right across the group and cuts to the other badgermole which pounds the ground with its paws and raises a wall of earth, blocking off the exits. Cuts to an overhead shot of the cave where one badgermole is seen using earthbending to create a split in the earth between the nomads and Sokka.\n",
      "Cuts to Sokka who tries to avoid the badgermole's swipes. He is blown back several feet and starts hastily backing away, his fingers hitting a string on the lute in the process, producing a musical note. Cuts to a close-up of a badgermole who cocks its head curiously. The creatures quiet down as he picks up the lute and begins playing a tune. \n",
      "CHONG: Hey, those things are music lovers! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Singing nervously.] Badgermoles coming toward me. Come on guys, help me out! \n",
      "CHONG: [Singing.] The big, bad badgermoles who earthbend the tunnels, hate the wolfbats, but love the sounds! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene switches to Aang and Katara who are standing underneath the ceiling of glowing crystals, their hands linked. \n",
      "AANG: They're made of some kind of crystal. They must only light up in the dark. \n",
      "KATARA: That's how the two lovers found each other. [Gestures with her hand along the ceiling.] They just put out their lights and followed the crystals. [Sees the exit.] That must be the way out! [The two hug.] \n",
      "AANG: So, uh ... \n",
      "KATARA: Let's go! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She runs toward the exit. Aang stares after her before shaking his head and smiling. He and Appa follow close behind. They make their way out of the cave and into the outdoors. Appa bounds out of the tunnel and flops onto his back, tongue lolling out in content. \n",
      "AANG: What about Sokka? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two seem a bit concerned at first, but a rumbling is heard. Cuts to an overhead shot of the exit where at that moment, Sokka and the band of nomads emerge from the cave, riding atop badgermoles. Debris flies everywhere and Aang and Katara shield themselves from the rubble. The camera pans upward to Sokka riding atop one of the creatures, waving, Momo flying about. \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to overhead shot of the cave, the camera panning to the left. Sokka dismounts the badgermole and approaches Katara. \n",
      "SOKKA: How did you guys get out? \n",
      "AANG: Just like the legend said, we let love lead the way. [Smiles sheepishly.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Really? We let huge, ferocious beasts lead our way. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He turns to the badgermoles and waves to them as they slowly plod their way into the cave again. Two walls of rock rise up where the badgermoles re-entered the cave. The camera pans to where Momo is seemingly communicating with Appa, telling him of his journey through the caves. Appa seemingly roars in response to the lemur. Katara is seen hugging her brother. \n",
      "KATARA: Why is your forehead all red? \n",
      "CHONG: [Talking about Aang.] Nobody react to what I'm about to tell you: I think that kid might be the Avatar! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka smacks his forehead, enlarging the red spot while Chong looks at him in curiosity. Meanwhile, Aang confronts the other nomads. \n",
      "AANG: So are you guys going to come to Omashu with us? \n",
      "MOKU: Nope. \n",
      "AANG: Okay. Thanks for everything, Moku. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The band of nomads begins walking away. The camera pans to where Chong is seen placing a necklace of flowers around Sokka's neck. \n",
      "CHONG: Sokka, I hope you learned a little something about not letting the plans get in the way of the journey. [Hugs him.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Irritated yet blushing.] Just play your songs. \n",
      "CHONG: Hey! Good plan! [Begins playing his lute and singing. Cuts to shot of Team Avatar.] Even if you're lost, you can't lose the love because it's in your heart. Da, da, da ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: While Chong is singing, Aang shoots a look at Katara, Sokka crosses his arms and Katara blushes. The camera pans upward and fades to a scene later in the day where the trio is heading up the mountainside to Omashu. \n",
      "SOKKA: [From afar.] The journey was long and annoying, but now you get to see what it's really about: the destination. [Close-up of him.] I present to you the Earth Kingdom city of O- [Pauses abruptly.] Oh no ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera shifts to behind him where they soon discover that Omashu has been captured and placed under Fire Nation rule. Ominous music is heard as a close-up of the entrance draped with a Fire Nation flag is shown. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fades to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens to a bright, blue sky, the sun shining. The camera zooms out quickly to reveal a red Fire Nation flag waving in the wind. Cuts to shot of the Earth Kingdom city of Omashu having been captured by the Fire Nation. A bold red flag bearing the Fire Nation insignia is proudly hung; gray plumes of smoke fill the air surrounding the fallen city. \n",
      "AANG: [Viewing the city, his back to the camera; in a somewhat shocked tone.] I can't believe it. I know the War has spread far, [Turning toward the camera sadly.] but Omashu always seemed ... untouchable. \n",
      "SOKKA: Up until now it was. [Crosses arms over chest.] Now Ba Sing Se is the only great Earth Kingdom stronghold left. \n",
      "KATARA: [Cuts to shot of entire group standing on the cliffside overlooking the city.] This is horrible, [Approaches Aang; cuts to side-view of the two standing next to each other.] but we have to move on. \n",
      "AANG: No, I'm going in to find Bumi. \n",
      "SOKKA: Aang, stop. We don't even know if Bumi's still ... \n",
      "AANG: [Angrily.] What? If he's still what? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Unsurely.] A-around. \n",
      "KATARA: I know you had your heart set on Bumi, but there are other people who can teach you earthbending. \n",
      "AANG: This isn't about finding a teacher. This is about finding my friend. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to below Omashu's gate where Aang is attempting to open the entrance to a secret tunnel. \n",
      "SOKKA: A secret passage? Why didn't we just use this last time? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang opens the tunnel, revealing it to be filled with sewage. \n",
      "SOKKA: Ugh! \n",
      "AANG: That answer your question? \n",
      "SOKKA: Eww! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The group proceeds through the tunnel to the inside of Omashu. Aang conjures an air ball with his staff to clear the path while Katara uses waterbending to maneuver the sewage carefully around her. Sokka, on the other hand, is continually soaked in the foul substance. \n",
      "KATARA: That wasn't as bad as I thought. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka emerges covered in slime. Katara spots water nearby and splashes Sokka with it using waterbending to wash off the sewage followed by Aang who uses airbending to dry him off while he screams which reveals that three pentapi have attached themselves to his skin. \n",
      "SOKKA: [In a panicking tone while trying to yank the pentapox off.] Ahh! They won't let go! Help! \n",
      "AANG: [Quickly tackles Sokka into a wall in order to slience him; in a somewhat cheerful tone.] Shh! Stop making so much noise. It's just a purple pentapus. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka looks at the pentapuses in fear. Aang removes the first pentapus by lightly rubbing its head as Sokka watches. Sokka rubs the spot where the creature was attached, and does the same procedure to get the second one off. Several guards suddenly approach them as Aang takes the third one off. \n",
      "GUARD.ONE: Hey! What are you kids doing out past curfew? \n",
      "KATARA: Sorry. We were just on our way home. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The kids turn and walk away, Sokka bringing up the rear. The guard notices the red welts on the back of Sokka's neck. \n",
      "GUARD.ONE: [Notices the spots where the pentapus was attached to Sokka.] Wait, what's the matter with him? \n",
      "KATARA: Uh, he has pentapox, sir. [As he approaches.] Umm, it's highly contagious. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Exaggerating.] Oh, it's so awful. I'm dying. \n",
      "KATARA: And deadly. \n",
      "GUARD.TWO: Hey, I think I heard of pentapox! Didn't your cousin Chang die of it? \n",
      "GUARD.ONE: We'd better go wash our hands, and burn our clothes. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The guards run away in fear. \n",
      "AANG: Thank you, sewer friends. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene switches to on board Azula's ship. She is consulting her assistants, Li and Lo. \n",
      "LI: When tracking your brother and uncle, traveling with the royal procession may no longer be an option. \n",
      "LO: May no longer be wise. \n",
      "LO.AND.LI: If you hope to keep the element of surprise. \n",
      "AZULA: You're right. The Royal Procession is dead weight. If I want to catch my prey, I must be agile, nimble. I need a small, elite team. It's time to visit some old friends. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene switches to Omashu by twilight, where Aang, Katara and Sokka with Momo on his shoulder are sneaking around. They hide behind some metal bars used for construction as a patrol passes. \n",
      "KATARA: Let's find Bumi and get out of here. \n",
      "SOKKA: Where would they be keeping him? \n",
      "AANG: Somewhere he can't earthbend. Somewhere made of metal. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The foursome goes on. The picture switches to a close-up of a young woman with black hair and an emotionless expression named Mai. Behind her walk two Fire Nation guards. \n",
      "MAI: There really is no fathoming the depths of my hatred for this place. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a wider shot to show Mai walking next to an older woman carrying a baby. They are being escorted by Fire Nation guards. \n",
      "MICHI: Mai, your father was appointed governor. We're like royalty here. Be happy and enjoy it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The picture widens as the camera zooms up to show some rocks, ready to be pushed down one of Omashu's mail delivery chutes which ends near where Mai's party is walking. You can clearly see the light of the torches from up above. \n",
      "RESISTANCE.FIGHTER: The targets are approaching. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Close-up of a bearded man wearing an Earth Kingdom military uniform. \n",
      "YUNG: Take them out. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut back to Mai's party walking down below. \n",
      "MAI: [In a dull tone.] I thought my life was boring in the Fire Nation, but this place is unbearably bleak. Nothing ever happens. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the resistance fighter at the beginning of the chute, who pushes the rocks down the chute with earthbending. Aang and his friends walk by and they see the rocks crumbling down at high speed. Aang looks in distress at Mai's party. He raises his staff and pulverizes the rock with a blast of air as it passes. Mai's party is alerted by the sound and looks up to see what caused it. Close-up of Mai who squints her eyes to make out who is standing above her before the picture shows Aang again. Cut back to the party. \n",
      "MICHI: [Pointing at Aang.] The resistance! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Close-up of Mai, who is seen for the first time with a faint smile on her face. She spreads her arms at Aang, causing tiny arrows to fly toward him. Aang quickly jumps up, avoiding the arrows which bury themselves in the stack of construction material Aang lands on. Aang, Katara, Sokka and Momo run away as two of the Fire Nation guards are climbing up ladders to get to them.\n",
      "Katara quickly turns around and uses the water from her pouch to form a water whip and send the two guards flying off into the deep. As you see them falling, we see Mai reaching the top. While she is running toward Katara, she stretches out her right hand, shooting off some more arrows. Katara raises a shield of ice to protect herself as the arrows embed themselves in it. Mai keeps charging Katara, who runs away. Mai jumps over the icy wall in hot pursuit of Katara. Aang awaits Katara and lets her pass as he awaits the arrival of Mai. With a spinning sweep of wind, he causes some of the construction scaffolding to collapse. Mai sees the scaffolding collapse and directs a throwing star right at Aang. He twirls his staff in front of him and catches the flying star with it. Mai stands on one side of the collapsed scaffolding and has a clear shot on Aang, Katara, Sokka and Momo. As she throws more arrows at them, the ground beneath the team opens up, making them disappear and rapidly closes again. Mai looks at the place where her targets disappeared, letting out a deep sigh. She turns around and walks away.\n",
      "Cut to a tunnel scene. The image shows the rectangle where the kids fell through. Green sewage waste drips from the ceiling. The camera moves down, revealing a group of people who are looking at the three kids. Aang and Sokka are rubbing their heads, while Katara just sits there a bit disorientated. Cut to a shot of Yung, flanked by two other men.\n",
      "The picture switches to an upside down shot of some grass. When the view pans up, we see mountains, circus tents and some people working in the background. Azula, also upside down, walks in. \n",
      "AZULA: Ty Lee, could that possibly be you? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera moves to show a close-up of a girl, Ty Lee, standing on her index fingers. She smiles when she sees Azula. \n",
      "TY.LEE: Azula! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Ty Lee flips from her stance and spins around in a graceful twirl to bow down before Azula. She runs forward to embrace Azula. \n",
      "TY.LEE: It is so good to see you! \n",
      "AZULA: Please, don't let me interrupt your ... [Raises an eyebrow in wonder.] whatever it is you were doing. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Ty Lee, still smiling, does a back flip and ends up lying on her chest with one leg stretched out over her head and the other straight up to the sky. \n",
      "AZULA: [Glances around.] Tell me, what is the daughter of a nobleman doing here? [Looks back at Ty Lee.] Certainly our parents didn't send us to the Royal Fire Academy for Girls to end up in ... [Looks to her side.] places like this. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Azula looks as three men are trying to move a platypus bear. The Bear groans and moves up to reveal that it has laid an egg. Azula looks at this in disgust and turns her attention back to Ty Lee, grinning once more. \n",
      "AZULA: I have a proposition for you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Ty Lee who is still lying on the ground, watching the same Platypus bear as Azula, but she looks happy to see what has happened. When Azula addresses her, she diverts her attention away from the bear and looks at Azula in a wondering gaze. \n",
      "AZULA: I'm hunting a traitor. [While looking casually at her nails.] You remember my old fuddy-duddy uncle, don't you? \n",
      "TY.LEE: [Resting on her chest and elbows, but now with her both feet resting on her head.] Oh yeah. He was so funny. \n",
      "AZULA: I would be honored if you would join me on my mission. \n",
      "TY.LEE: Oh ... I ... uh ... would love to. [She stands up in a fluid elegant movement.] But the truth is, I'm really happy here. [Smiling sincerely.] I mean, my aura has never been pinker! \n",
      "AZULA: [Raising up her hand in a \"stop\" motion to Ty Lee.] I'll take your word for it. Well, I wouldn't want you to give up the life you love just to please me. \n",
      "TY.LEE: [Bows in respect.] Thank you, Azula. [Continues stretching.] \n",
      "AZULA: [While walking away.] Of course, before I leave, I'm going to catch your show. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Ty Lee's accidentally breaks her stance, as she gasps in panic. She continues her stretch once more and the expression of panic changes to one of worry. \n",
      "TY.LEE: [Hesitantly.] Uh ... yeah ... sure ... uh ... of course ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut back to Omashu, where a lot of people have gathered in some sort of underground cave. At the other side of the room, Aang, Sokka, and Katara enter the large space through a tunnel; they are talking to three other men. \n",
      "AANG: So, is King Bumi with you guys? Is he leading the resistance? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a close-up of Yung who angrily balls his fist as he answers Aang's question. \n",
      "YUNG: Of course not! The day of the invasion, we readied ourselves for battle. We were prepared to defend our city ... to fight for our lives and for our freedom. But before we even had a chance, King Bumi surrendered. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera moves slowly toward Aang, who is clearly disconcerted by the news. Katara gives Aang a look of concern. \n",
      "YUNG: The day of the invasion, I asked King Bumi what he wanted to do. [Cut to his close-up.] He looked me in the eye and said ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A flashback shows the day Omashu was under attack. King Bumi and Yung stand atop one of the city's walls, looking down while fire balls decorate the sky. \n",
      "KING.BUMI: I'm going to do ... nothing! [He starts to laugh and snort like the mad lunatic he is.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The flashback fades away to make room for another close-up of Yung. \n",
      "YUNG: It doesn't matter now. [Cut to Aang who sadly lowers his eyes as the resistance leader continues.] Fighting the Fire Nation is the only path to freedom. [Switch to a close-up of Yung again.] And freedom is worth dying for. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As Yung ends his speech, a smile plays on his face. Aang sadly leans on his staff. He raises his eyes as while he addresses Yung. \n",
      "AANG: Actually there's another path to freedom. You could leave Omashu. You're directing all your energy to fight the Fire Nation. [The camera pans to the right, showing several Earth Kingdom soldiers.] But you're outnumbered. You can't win. Now's the time to retreat, so you can live to fight another day. \n",
      "YUNG: You don't understand. They've taken our home, and we have to fight them at any cost! [He makes some powerful hand gestures to make his point more clear.] \n",
      "RESISTANCE.FIGHTER.#1: [In a soft tone.] I don't know, Yung, living to fight another day is startin' to sound pretty good to me. \n",
      "RESISTANCE.FIGHTER.#2: [He takes a step forward and points toward himself. He addresses Yung with a decisive tone.] Yeah, I'm with the kid! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Yung looks at all the people who have taken refuge under ground and now are living in the sewer tunnels while they whisper among themselves. He looks back at Aang. \n",
      "YUNG: Fine. But there's thousands of citizens that need to leave. How're we going to get them all out? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Switch to Sokka whose hand is on his chin as he is cooking up a plan. He points at Yung as he exclaims his idea. \n",
      "SOKKA: Suckers! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara raises one eyebrow and just stares at Sokka. The rest of the group follows her example. Momo chirps questionably. Sokka blinks, shifting his eyes right and left, smiling broadly. \n",
      "SOKKA: You're all about to come down with a nasty case of pentapox. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a shot of a bucket of water filled with pentapi. A hand reaches in and takes one out. The civilian, whose face is already covered with the marks of removed pentapi, places it on his exposed left arm. Its jellylike body moves up and down a bit. After a few seconds, someone else removes the pentapus by gently rubbing its head. We see several shots of people placing and removing pentapi from their face, shoulders and arms.\n",
      "Switch to a top view of the people as Sokka walks over to them to address them. While he speaks, the camera pans out, showing a close-up of all the inhabitants of Omashu covered with the suction spots of the pentapi. \n",
      "SOKKA: The marks make ya look sick, but you gotta act sick too. Ya gotta sell it! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: An old man hobbles into view, leaning heavily on his cane. He clutches his back while moaning in pain. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Grabs the guy who is standing next to him and points at the old man.] Now that's what I'm talkin' about. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The man turns around, smiling. He taps his wooden leg with his cane. \n",
      "OLD.MAN: Years of practice. \n",
      "SOKKA: Okay everyone! Into sick formation. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka and the other civilians start walking toward the gates of Omashu. Just as Katara wants to join them, she notices that Aang is walking off in the other direction. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, what are you doing? Aren't you coming with us? \n",
      "AANG: [He turns around.] No. I'm not leaving until I find Bumi. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo jumps on Aang's shoulders, tugging Aang's lips. He grabs Momo by his neck and places him back on the ground. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang uses airbending to propel him unto the air. He whizzes away, jumping from one rooftop to the other.\n",
      "Switch to some Fire Nation soldiers with spears who are guarding the gates of Omashu. A moaning crowd of 'sick' people walks toward them from every direction. They move like zombies, swaying back and forth. One of them even falls down. The guards back away as the sick crowd reaches them. Sokka theatrically grabs his face and moans painfully, before stretching out his hands toward the frightened guards. \n",
      "SOLDIER: Plague! Plague! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The guards on the ground start to retreat into the citadel behind them, away from the sick, while another guard rings the gong to alert everyone of the problem at hand.\n",
      "Switch to the governor of Omashu and his family, including Mai, who is eating a bowl of fire flakes, watching on one of his balconies, looking out over the city. \n",
      "UKANO: What is going on down there? \n",
      "GUARD: I saw some kids yesterday who were sick with pentapox. It must have spread! \n",
      "UKANO: Pentapox! [He pulls his beard.] Hmm, I'm pretty sure I've heard of that. \n",
      "MICHI: Oh, this is terrible. \n",
      "GUARD: What should we do? \n",
      "UKANO: Drive them out of the city [He points toward the gates.] ... but don't touch them! We have to rid the city of this disease! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The guard bows in respect before leaving to spread the governor's orders. Mai calmly offers her dad the bowl of fire flakes. \n",
      "MAI: Fire flakes, Dad? \n",
      "MICHI: [Gasping.] How awful! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The governor's family is shown from behind. As his wife hugs her husband, the little baby beside her, Mai's brother Tom-Tom toddles away from the group.\n",
      "Switch to Aang running through the streets of the city. He nimbly climbs a house and balances on the railing, before landing on a flat rooftop. He spots a giant, white creature below, sadly pushing forth a turnstile. Aang jumps down to discover that the creature is Flopsie, King Bumi's pet goat gorilla. \n",
      "AANG: Flopsie! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As Aang calls his name, Flopsie turns around and happily tries to reach his friend. His chains hold him back, so he sadly ceases his attempts. Aang jumps over him and uses the water from his drinking bowl to freeze the lock on his chains. With one swing of his staff, Aang destroys the lock, freeing Flopsie. The happy animal hugs and licks Aang's face. \n",
      "AANG: Come on, Flopsie. [He climbs on top of Flopsie.] You gotta help me find Bumi. Yip Yip! [Flopsie does not move a muscle.] Oh ... I guess that doesn't work with you. Let's go! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Flopsie races off at great speed. Meanwhile Momo is soaring through the city. He lands on a balcony and peeks through a window. We see a cluttered room with dressing panels at the back. A teddy bear is thrown repeatedly in the air by someone behind the panels. Momo spots a full scale of berries and starts to drool. He quickly enters the chamber through the window and starts to stuff his face. He rapidly spits out the seeds. Some of them land behind the panels. Cut to Tom-Tom who is playing with the stuffed animal behind the panels. He notices the seeds and crawls away, following their path. The trail of seeds leads right back to Momo, who is still sitting on the table, his tail dangling over the edge. Tom-Tom sits up in wonder as he examines the tail before pulling it. Cut to a surprised Momo who is pulled down to the ground in mid bite. He pulls a giggling Tom-Tom along as he tries to get away from his grasp. Momo pulls free and jumps out of the window on to the railing. As he looks back, he sees that the baby stumbles toward him with his arms spread out wide. Momo backs away, leaping of the railing and flying away. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The baby is too late to grab Momo, so he tumbles off the railing. While he is sliding down the roof, he cannot stop giggling. He lands in a box of berries sliding down one of Omashu's chutes. Momo lands on the same box and starts to stuff his face again. His eyes open wide as Tom-Tom emerges behind him. The baby grabs Momo's tail and bites it. The lemur jumps in the air and frantically flaps his wings in an attempt to get away once more. As the slope becomes steeper, Momo is able to lift himself as well as Tom-Tom who is still clinging on to his tail. The lemur cannot bear the weight and they start to descend. Tom-Tom is being dragged over the ground as they crash-land. Tom-Tom rolls over the ground and lands on top of Momo, pinning him to the ground, and causing him to screech and shake around desperately. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The moaning crowd passes them by, diverting Tom-Tom attention away from Momo. Momo escapes into the crowd. The baby pushes himself to his feet and staggers after the crowd, out of the gates. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the Fire Nation circus at night. Upon entering, performers in two Chinese dragon's costumes are dancing. As they move out of the frame, the circus master, Shuzumu, stands before the circus' main ring, addressing the crowd. \n",

      "SHUZUMU: [Concerned.] Uh ... the thing is ... the performers ... \n",
      "AZULA: You're right, you're right. That's been done. [After a short pause, she continues with a tone of dark pleasure.] I know. Set the net on fire. \n",
      "SHUZUMU: [Worried.] Of course, Princess. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: With a worried look upon his face, Shuzumu leaves the box to set the net of fire. Ty Lee looks down in concern at the consuming flames beneath her. She continues with her act.\n",
      "Cut back to the box seat, where Shuzumu is balling his fist and clenching his teeth, hoping that Ty Lee will not fall off. \n",
      "AZULA: [Ecstatic.] Brilliant, just brilliant! [She looks down at Shuzumu and asks happily.] Ooh, what kind of dangerous animals do you have? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Shuzumu looks up, hopeful that he can change the subject to the animals and save Ty Lee from her burning peril. \n",
      "SHUZUMU: Well, our circus boasts the most exotic assortment- \n",
      "AZULA: Release them all! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Shuzumu looks utterly shocked by Azula's command. Close-up again of Ty Lee's worried face, as she is still balancing on one hand above the flames. Cut to an outside-view of the circus. As the camera pans up, several animal noises fill the night.\n",
      "Switch to an overview shot of a campsite in the surrounding mountains of Omashu. People are sitting around several campfires. Cut to Aang and Flopsie who are walking into the camp. Katara and Sokka move to greet a sad looking Aang. \n",

      "The arrival of Yung interrupts their hugs. \n",
      "YUNG: We've got a problem. We just did a head count. \n",

      "YUNG: No, we have an extra. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Yung points to something to the left. Katara gazes in that direction and sees Momo staggering forward with the Tom-Tom clamped around his neck. Team Avatar and Yung just stare for a second at the poor animal and the baby. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the governor's house in Omashu. The governor's wife is sobbing on the balcony. Her daughter Mai slowly reaches into her robe and pulls out a handkerchief and gives it to her mother with a bored expression on her face. The governor rests his hands on the railing of the balcony as he stares out over his city. His sobbing wife, apathetic daughter and two guards stand behind him. Zoom toward the governor as he speaks. \n",
      "UKANO: So, the resistance has kidnapped my son. Everything so clever, so tricky. Just like their King Bumi. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera pans out, showing a panoramic view of the city. \n",
      "The view fades to a bouquet of black flowers that are being placed on a desk. As the camera moves back, Azula and Ty Lee are revealed in Ty Lee's dressing room. Azula is standing behind Ty Lee, who is sitting at the desk and looking through a mirror. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Switch back to an overview shot of the campsite in the valley. The gang, the baby, Flopsie and three resistance fighters are sitting at one of the many campfires. The baby is still trying to catch Momo. The lemur leaps out of the way and the baby tumbles down, right next to Sokka's club. He picks it up and starts to suck on it. The camera moves back as Sokka snatches the club out of the baby's hands. \n",
      "SOKKA: No! Bad Fire Nation baby! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The child starts to cry. Katara looks from the baby to Sokka and whacks him across the face before placing her hands on her hips in a motherly fashion. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Annoyed.] Oh ... all right. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka gives his club back to the baby who immediately stops crying and starts to play with it. Katara hugs him from behind. \n",

      "YUNG: Sure he's cute now, but when he's older, he'll join the Fire Nation army. [Switch to Katara who is happily playing with the baby under the annoyed gaze of her brother.] You won't think he's so cute then. He'll be a killer. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara picks the baby up and shows him to Yung. \n",

His son [Zoom to Aang's surprised face while he continues dramatically, his eyes widening.] for King Bumi. \n",

      "SOKKA: You realize we're probably walking right into a trap. \n",
      "AANG: I don't think so. I'm sure the governor wants his son back as much as we want Bumi. [Smiling at the sleeping baby he holds against his chest.] It's a new day. I have a good feeling about this. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to inside the city of Omashu. A royal palanquin is being carried up the stairs toward the house of the governor. The silhouette of Azula can be seen through the veils. At the base of next stairs, the lonely figure of Mai awaits the arrival of the palanquin. Azula gets out and she and Ty Lee walk over to Mai. They halt before her. Mai puts her hands together and bows slightly toward Azula. \n",

I'm renaming it in honor of my father, the city of New Ozai. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera stops on a large statue of Ozai, still in its scaffolds. The camera pans down. A long overview shot reveals Aang, Katara and Sokka standing on a large wooden scaffold. They look serious as a party of three girls approaches, with Mai leading the way.\n",
      "A crane is shown, lowering a metal cage. A close-up of the cage reveals that it is used to contain King Bumi. Only his head is left uncovered. \n",

      "AZULA: It just doesn't seem like a fair trade, does it? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Close-up of Mai's gray eyes as she ponders over the idea. She looks at her brother who yawns and happily rests his head against Sokka's shoulder. \n",

      "AANG: Bumi! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He sprints forward with his glider at the ready, increasing his speed with airbending. Azula tries to stop him by blocking his path with a mighty stream of blue flames. Aang dodges these by leaping high up into the air. Azula is completely shocked by this incredible jump. Aang briefly touches the scaffolding around the statue and pushes himself off, opening his glider in mid air. While opening his glider, he loses his hat, leaving his arrow tattoo exposed. He holds on to the hat with his teeth. \n",
      "AZULA: [Surprised.] The Avatar! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang circles up toward Bumi's coffin. Cut back to Azula who smiles smugly. \n",
      "AZULA: My lucky day. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She runs over to a pulley and blast through the rope that serves as a break. The winch begins to spin rapidly. Azula grabs hold to the rope and is pulled up rapidly toward the top of the construction scaffolding.\n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to an overview shot of Sokka and Katara running to the edge of the big platform. Before they can reach it, Ty Lee's fist emerges from one of the holes in the floor and punches Sokka's foot, causing him to fall over and slide toward the edge. He protectively clutches the baby in his arms, preparing for the worst, but they stop just in time.\n",
      "Switch back to Katara, who sees Ty Lee jumping out of the hole in the floor and setting course for Sokka. She bends water from her pouch to attack her, but notices something behind her. Cut to a close-up of Mai, who throws four knives at Katara. Katara reacts by quickly by using her water whip to raise up several wooden planks. A close-up of Katara shows that the wooden board is just in time to prevent the knives from piercing her face. The knives embed themselves in the wood. Katara uses her water whip again to shoot the wooden boards to Mai. She turns around in one fluent motion toward Ty Lee who has almost reached Sokka and the baby by now. The water whip grabs Ty Lee by the ankle, pulling her to the ground. This gives Sokka the time he needs to get up and head for a nearby ladder. He slides down and starts his descend of the scaffolding.\n",
      "Switch to Bumi and Aang, who are still being raised in the air. Aang is still trying to freeze the chain with his breath. \n",
      "KING.BUMI: Aang, stop your blowing for a minute. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A close-up shows that he finally succeeds in freezing the chain, when an explosion occurs on top of the scaffolding. Azula is propelled in the air and shoots a plume of blue fire toward Aang with a powerful kick. Aang startles by her sudden appearance and swift attack. He deflects the flame with a strong air current of his own. \n",
      "KING.BUMI: Now hold on just a [The swing of Aang's staff breaks the frozen chain and they freefall down.] duahhh!!! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang turns over Bumi's coffin, so he would crash to the ground head first. As they are about to crash upon one of Omashu's chutes, Aang creates an air ball under them to break their fall. They rapidly slide down the chute they landed in.\n",
      "Cut to Azula who was following the spectacle from atop the scaffolding. She frowns and sprints to a nearby chute, pursuing the Avatar and the King down the chute in a box of her own.\n",
      "Switch to a laughing Aang standing on Bumi's coffin. \n",
      "AANG: It's just like old times, isn't it, Bumi? \n",
      "KING.BUMI: [Looking serious.] Aang, I need to talk to you! \n",
      "AANG: It's good to see you too! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: While Aang is still smiling, he notices the fast approach of something in a chute on his left. He turns to see what it is, just as Azula shoots several fire missiles toward them. He spins his staff above his head to deflect them. Both chutes come together and Azula is now behind them. Aang directs a gust at her, but she parts it with her hands clasped together in front of her. She retaliates with several fire blasts. Aang ducks underneath them and starts to peddle with his staff, increasing their speed. They enter a portion of the chute that has wooden arches over it at short intervals. Aang cuts these through with an air blade, making them collapse upon the track. Azula is caught in the dust cloud, knocked up by the falling debris. When her box emerges again, it seems to be empty. Aang does not see Azula anymore and sighs in relief, but his sigh quickly turns into a scream as Azula emerges again from the box, sending another beam of fire toward him. Aang drops flat on his belly to avoid it. Cut back to the large wooden platform where Mai and Katara are still fighting. Mai dodges Katara's water whips and answers her attacks by shooting stiletto's out of the launcher attached to her leg. Katara easily defends herself by freezing the water to create an ice wall. Mai uses this time to charge Katara head on. The waterbender defends herself by capturing Mai's right arm in a stream of water and freezing it. Mai tries to break the ice, but fails. Ty Lee climbs on the platform behind Katara. She bounces toward Katara and hits her with several quick jabs on her arms. Katara is surprised by this attack and loses control over her water stream that splashes on the ground. She tries to raise the water again, but it only moves a little. \n",
      "MAI: [Taunting.] How are you gonna fight without your bending? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Mai pulls out a sai from her robe and takes aim at a shocked Katara. Just as she is about to throw the weapon, Sokka's boomerang knocks it out of her hand. Ty Lee and Mai spin around to see Sokka flying in on Appa. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Catching the boomerang.] I seem to manage! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka and Appa land between Katara and her attackers. As Appa lands, he slams his tail hard on the ground, sending Mai and Ty Lee flying off the scaffolding.\n",
      "Sokka and Katara are flying down the chutes of Omashu atop Appa's head. Katara looks and points to her left. \n",
      "KATARA: There's Aang! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Gazing in the direction Katara pointed.] We can catch him! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: With a growl, Appa changes course toward Aang.\n",
      "Cut to Azula who is still on the offensive, directing multiple beams of fire at Aang. He spins his staff around in defense while they are still rocketing down the chute. Appa pulls up next to him. \n",
      "AANG: Hang on, Bumi! Our ride's here! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa swerves to avoid another blue fire blast. As he pulls closer again, Aang lifts up the coffin by hitting the side of the chute. Katara and Sokka try to grab hold of the coffin as it passes overhead, but they cannot reach it. Bumi screams as he and Aang fall down. Aang moves the coffin to a more horizontal position in midair. Their fall is broken by another chute as they land crosswise on it, breaking right through. They land on another chute and start to slide down once again with Azula on their trail.\n",
      "Switch to Azula who creates a whirling disk of flames and sends it down the chute. It rapidly gains on Aang and Bumi. Bumi peeks at the upcoming fire disk and clenches his teeth in effort. A pillar of earth rises in the middle of the chute, protecting them from the disk. Azula gasps for air as she notices that her path is blocked. She jumps up in the nick of time and slides down the chute on foot, while her box slams to pieces against the rock. She eventually halts in the middle of the chute, looking displeased at Aang and Bumi who continue their descent.\n",
      "Cut to Aang and Bumi who are nearing the end of the chute. \n",
      "AANG: [Shocked.] You could earthbend? All along? \n",
      "KING.BUMI: Well, they didn't cover my face. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Bumi strains himself again in effort and raises another earth pillar to stop their descent down the chute. The coffin hits it and ends up standing straight atop the rock, while Aang lands in front of it, looking up at his friend. \n",
      "AANG: [Slightly annoyed and angry.] I don't understand. Why didn't you free yourself? Why did you surrender when Omashu was invaded? What's the matter with you, Bumi? \n",
      "KING.BUMI: [Calmly.] Listen to me, Aang. There are options in fighting, called jing. It's a choice of how you direct your energy. \n",
      "AANG: [Cut to a close-up of an annoyed Aang, counting along on his fingers as he sums up the different jings.] I know! There's positive jing when you're attacking, and negative jing when you're retreating. \n",
      "KING.BUMI: [Happily smiling.] ... and neutral jing when you do nothing! \n",
      "AANG: [He looks shocked at his three raised fingers.] There are three jings? \n",
      "KING.BUMI: Well, technically there are eighty-five, but let's just focus on the third. Neutral jing is the key to earthbending. It involves listening and waiting for the right moment to strike. \n",
      "AANG: [Starting to understand.] That's why you surrendered, isn't it? \n",
      "KING.BUMI: Yes, and it's why I can't leave now. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang sadly turns around. \n",
      "AANG: [Disappointed.] I guess I need to find someone else to teach me earthbending. \n",
      "KING.BUMI: Your teacher will be someone who has mastered neutral jing. You need to find someone who waits and listens before striking. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo lands on Aang's shoulders. \n",
      "AANG: [Happily.] Hey, Momo! \n",
      "KING.BUMI: Momo's mastered a few jings himself! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo screeches loudly at Bumi. \n",
      "KING.BUMI: Goodbye, Aang. I'll see you when the time is right. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: King Bumi lets his coffin tumble backward and begins his ascend of the chute. He laughs and snorts like a mad man while he uses his earthbending to drive him back to the top of the chute, leaving Aang and Momo behind.\n",
      "Cut to the royal palanquin being carried out the city, flanked by Mai and Ty Lee. \n",
      "MAI: So, we're tracking down your brother and Uncle, huh? \n",
      "TY.LEE: [Turning to Mai.] It'll be interesting seeing Zuko again, [Teasing.] won't it, Mai? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Mai looks away as a smile plays upon her face. \n",
      "AZULA: It's not just Zuko and Iroh anymore. [Cut closer to Azula who continues on a serious tone.] We have a third target now. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene fades to Aang that night, peeking down over the gutter of the governor's house. The governor holds his wife while they are looking over the city with a sad expression on their face. Aang silently lands behind them and drops off Tom-Tom. Aang takes off again while the child toddles toward his parents. As they hear the cooing of the child, they turn around, gasping with surprise and excitement. \n",
      "MICHI: Tom-Tom! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The governor and his wife joyfully take the baby up into their arms under the watchful eye of Aang who is sitting on the roof. He smiles at the happy scene of the reunited family before he takes off. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fades to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens with an overhead shot of rice paddies. The camera pans down, revealing an Earth Kingdom village. The scene cuts to a shot of a bridge over a nearby stream. People carrying backpacks and other loads walk back and forth over the bridge, either entering or departing the small village.\n",
      "The scene cuts to a street within the village. Iroh and Zuko are sitting on straw mats, their stolen ostrich horse lying behind them. A cart with masks for sale passes by in front of them; one of the masks is seen to be the Blue Spirit mask. As the cart passes, another pedestrian walks in front of Iroh. Iroh holds his hat out to the pedestrian and begins to talk to him. \n",
      "IROH: [Somewhat enthusiastically.] Spare coins for weary travelers? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The pedestrian tosses a couple of copper pieces into Iroh's hat as Zuko turns to Iroh in anger. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Angrily, with his arms folded.] This is humiliating! We're royalty! These people should be giving us whatever we want. \n",
      "IROH: They will if you ask nicely. [A peasant woman strolls past; somewhat dramatically.] Spare change for a hungry old man? \n",
      "PEASANT.GIRL: [Withdrawing a coin from her sleeve.] Aw, here you go. \n",
      "IROH: The coin is appreciated, but not as much as your smile! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko slaps his forehead in frustration as the young girl giggles lightly and walks away. As soon as she walks away, a man with dual broadswords on his back wanders up to Iroh and Zuko. \n",
      "BROADSWORD.MAN: [Smiling.] How about some entertainment in exchange for ... a gold piece? [He pulls the piece from his pocket with a flourish.] \n",
      "ZUKO: [Annoyed.] We're not performers. \n",
      "IROH: [Standing up.] Not professional anyway. [He puts the hat down and stands up, swaying lightly as he begins to sing.] It's a long, long way to Ba Sing Se, but the girls in the city, they look so pretty! \n",
      "BROADSWORD.MAN: [Annoyed with the quality of the entertainment.] Come on, we're talking a gold piece here! Let's see some action! [Zuko glances up sharply as the man withdraws his swords.] Dance! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The man begins to slice the ground near Iroh's feet; Iroh hops up and down to \"dodge\" the attacks while Zuko struggles to control his anger at the man. A birds-eye shot of the street shows other citizens have stopped to watch the spectacle. \n",
      "IROH: [Singing.] They kiss so sweet that you really got to meet the girls from Ba Sing Se! \n",
      "BROADSWORD.MAN: [Stops slicing and laughs.] Ha, ha! Nothing like a fat man dancing for his dinner! Here ya go! [Tosses the gold coin onto the ground and walks away.] \n",
      "IROH: [Dramatically; close to tears.] Such a kind man. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko glares after the man in anger and humiliation. The camera cuts to Appa, flying through a gray sky over a large forested area; it is covered somewhat by fog, and looks rather menacing. Sokka is rubbing a whetstone against his machete, while Katara is studying a scroll. Aang stares at the swamp, and seems to be in a trance. Sokka notices they were slowly flying down, and notices Aang's trance-like state. \n",
      "SOKKA: [To Aang.] Hey, you taking us down for a reason? [Aang continues to stare at the swamp.] Aang, [Aang snaps out of the trance.] why are we going down? \n",
      "AANG: [Confused.] What? I didn't even notice. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera zooms out to see Appa flying down toward the swamp \n",
      "SOKKA: Are you noticing now? \n",
      "KATARA: [Moving to the front of the saddle.] Is something wrong? \n",
      "AANG: [He still seems somewhat dazed by the swamp.] I know this is going to sound weird, but I think the swamp is calling to me. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Holding his stomach.] Is it telling you where we can get something to eat? \n",
      "AANG: No, I ... I think it wants us to land there. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Shrugging.] No offense to the swamp, but I don't see any land there to land on. \n",
      "AANG: I don't know. Bumi said to learn earthbending I would have to wait and listen, and now I'm actually hearing the earth. Do you want me to ignore it? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka, Katara and Momo look over Appa's saddle down at the swamp \n",
      "SOKKA: Yes. \n",
      "KATARA: I don't know. There's something ominous about that place. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo hides inside Appa's saddle as Appa groans. \n",
      "SOKKA: See, even Appa and Momo don't like it here. \n",
      "AANG: [Resignedly.] Okay, since everyone feels so strongly about this, [Looks at swamp.] bye swamp. [Shakes Appa's rope.] Yip, Yip! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa groans and flies upward, away from the swamp. A tornado suddenly emerges from out of nowhere, heading right for Appa. Sokka, hearing something, turns around and finally sees it. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Panicked.] You better throw in an extra \"yip\"! We gotta move! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa starts to fly faster, attempting to avoid the tornado, however he is not fast enough to get away. As the tornado begins to move closer to Appa, the wind pulls Sokka right off from the saddle. Katara manages to grab his hand, holding him back from flying into the tornado. Aang jumps up onto Appa's saddle and creates an air shield around Appa, stabilizing the air and allowing Sokka to fall back into the saddle, uninjured. The wind sucks Appa, who is still protected by the air shield, into the tornado. Aang struggles to maintain the air shield, however as it shrinks, one of Appa's legs slips from the protective air, thereby breaking it. Aang, Katara, and Sokka fall off Appa, with Aang landing lightly in muddied water as the latter two land quite roughly. Appa and Momo are thrown elsewhere in the swamp. \n",
      "AANG: [Looking around the swamp and at his friends.] Where's Appa and Momo? [Aang jumps up to the top of the trees, looking for his animal friends as he uses the height to search for them.] Appa! Momo! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts back to Katara and Sokka. Katara glances at her elbow before looking up at her brother. \n",
      "KATARA: [Pointing blandly.] Sokka, you've got an elbow leech. \n",
      "SOKKA: [He spins around, panicking, trying to find it.] Where? Where? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A creature is shown sticking on to Sokka's elbow. \n",
      "KATARA: [Crosses her arms; sarcastically.] Where do you think? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Ripping off the elbow leech and throwing it behind to Katara. He cries out angrily.] Why do things keep attaching to me?! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang swings over the muddied water on a vine, waiting for it to stop moving so he can land. \n",
      "KATARA: You couldn't find them? \n",
      "AANG: [Jumping down into the muddy water.] No, and the tornado ... it just disappeared. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara and Sokka turn to face the darkness in the swamp. The scene switches to Appa, who is hanging suspended over the swamp, caught in a mass of vines. Momo jumps up from the saddle and begins chewing through the vines. Appa falls, with Momo, into the muddy water. He shakes the water from his fur and takes off flying, before again becoming trapped. Appa groans as Momo berates him, before the lemur begins to cut the vines, again. The scene switches back to Aang, Katara, and Sokka. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Cutting the vines with his machete.] We better speed things up. \n",
      "AANG: [To Sokka.] Maybe we should be a little nicer to the swamp. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Continuing to cut the vines.] Aang, these are just plants. Do you want me to say \"please\" and \"thank you\" as I swing my machete back and forth? \n",
      "KATARA: Maybe you should listen to Aang. Something about this place feels ... alive. \n",
      "SOKKA: I'm sure there are lots of things that are alive here and if we don't wanna wind up getting eaten by them, we need to find Appa as fast as we can. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka continues to slice through the vines. The shot changes perspective to show Aang, Katara and Sokka through the vines, as though someone is looking at them. The scene changes to Appa and Momo. Appa is walking on the wet, muddy ground, trailing his footprints behind, carrying Momo on his back. A tree trunk happens to be in Appa's way, and the bison collapses to the ground, unwilling to attempt flying over it or crawling beneath it. Momo takes Aang's bison whistle and blows it to make Appa move. The bison ignores it the first time, growling angrily, but when Momo blows it a second time, he uses his tail to squash the lemur. Dazed from the blow, Momo sways and collapses. The scene changes back to Aang, Katara, and Sokka, now walking through a foggier part of the swamp. \n",
      "KATARA: [Yelling.] Appa! Momo! \n",
      "SOKKA: There's no way they can hear us and no way we can see them. We'll have to make camp for the night. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Several flies surround Sokka. Sokka swings his machete at them, trying to shoo them away. At that moment, a huge bubble of swamp gas rises from the muddy water below them. The gas grows closer to Aang, Katara, and Sokka. \n",
      "KATARA: What was that? \n",
      "SOKKA: Nothing, just swamp gas. [Indicating.] Look, there's nothing supernatural going on here. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The three groan as the smell reaches them, with Sokka waving his hand in front of his nose as Katara clamps hers shut. Suddenly, the quiet is shattered by a terrifying scream, causing them all to scream and huddle together, looking around wide-eyed for the source. The camera zooms backward, showing a small, grumpy-looking white bird. It opens its beak extremely wide, emitting the terrifying scream, and flutters off. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sweating, his voice cracking.] I think we should build a fire. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka runs off to a nearby tree and cuts pieces of wood from its roots. Aang and Katara walk up to Sokka. \n",
      "AANG: Sokka, the longer we're here, the more I think you shouldn't be doing do that. \n",
      "SOKKA: No, I asked the swamp. It said this was fine. [Grabs a nearby root.] Right, swamp? [Shakes the root and fakes a reply.] \"No problem, Sokka!\" \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka continues to chop up the roots, while Aang looks somewhat annoyed. The scene changes to a later shot of the trio around a fire. Katara glancing around at the swamp. \n",
      "KATARA: Does anyone else get the feeling that we're being watched? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka is shown with a fly buzzing around him. He does not seems scared anymore. \n",
      "SOKKA: Please, we're all alone out here. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka uses his machete to try and scare the fly off. The fly turns into a big, shining ball of light. It flies away from the gang, illuminating over a dozen pairs of eyes staring at them. They turn around and see them. \n",
      "AANG: Except for them. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They turn back around and huddle together. \n",
      "SOKKA: [His calm demeanor vanishing.] Right, except for them. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to Appa and Momo, who are lying down on a giant tree branch. The constant nocturnal noises echoing around them has Momo scuttling frantically from one end of the saddle to the other whilst chittering in fear. Appa, unable to sleep by the noise, growls loudly, causing the noises to stop, and Momo settles down on Appa's saddle. As Momo begins to close his eyes, another small sound is heard, causing his ears to perk up and his eyes to widen. The scene changes back to Aang, Katara, and Sokka. The camp fire is beginning to die out, and the three friends are huddled together, sleeping. Another perspective shot shows someone looking at them through the vines. A vine snakes its way to Sokka's leg, which is sticking out, and begins to wind around both it and Sokka's whole body.\n",
      "The shot cuts to an overhead view of the three, each tied up by several vines that snake out of the frame. The scene cuts to a close-up profile shot of the three. For a moment, they are still asleep - Sokka holding his machete and drooling - but they awake screaming as the vines simultaneously yank them all out off the screen and away from each other.\n",
      "The scene cuts to Sokka. He plants the blade of his machete in the ground as he is dragged away. Both Katara and Aang are also dragged off into the mist. Sokka gets up and looks around for his sister and Aang. The respite does not last long as vines are suddenly thrown at him. They wrap around him and attempt to drag him away again. Before he can travel too far, Sokka starts hacking the vines with his machete. He frees himself and runs back down the tree root, pursued by more vines.\n",
      "The scene cuts to Katara, struggling to free herself from the vines. Using a water whip she cuts through her bonds and runs off into the mist.\n",
      "The scene cuts to Aang, who frees himself by creating an air bubble around him and expanding it. His bonds attach to the bubble, and Aang jumps away before they ensnare him again. He jumps through the trees, closely pursued by more vines. He escapes a vine that pulls him to the ground using his airbending to propel himself far away and soon finds himself alone in the swamp. Cut to a wide shot of Aang looking around for his friends. \n",
      "AANG: Guys? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene fades to a shot of Appa's footprint, which is now filled with swamp water. Two figures are looking down at the footprint. Due is tall and skinny, while his friend Tho is short and fat. Both wear small, animal skin loincloths and have a single, large leaf on their heads to serve as a hat. Tho is carrying a stick, and uses it to indicate the animal track. \n",
      "DUE: What'd you reckon make a track like that, Tho? \n",
      "THO: Don't know, Due. [Points his stick at the footprint.] Some'in with six legs. Pretty big'uns too. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera pans up to reveal more of Appa's tracks in the mud. \n",
      "DUE: Leaves a nice, wide trail to folla'. \n",
      "THO: You know what's at the end of that trail? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Due shakes his head in the negative. Cut to a close-up of Tho's smiling face. \n",
      "THO: [Grinning.] Dinner. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to Appa swimming in the marshy water before cutting to a close-up of Momo. A fly is buzzing around his head, and he watches it, shifting his eyes from side to side. It flies off, and Momo goes after it. He lands on a nearby tree root, still attempting to catch the fly. He hops from tree root to tree root, following the fly, although unknowingly lands on the back of a catgator. He catches the fly on the last root, but lets go of it as he jumps to fly away from the creature. It pursues Momo as he flies back to Appa. The camera pans left, following the chase. When Momo and the crocodile reach Appa, the sky bison's mouth is open and the catgator swims right into it. Appa holds the creature there for a moment, before spitting it back out. Momo and the catfish crocodile hiss at each other for a moment, and the crocodile swims off. The scene cuts back to Appa, who shakes his head and loudly groans.\n",
      "Cut to Katara, who is walking through an area where the tree roots are covered in white flowers. \n",
      "KATARA: [Calling out.] Aang! Sokka! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Ahead of Katara is another Water Tribe woman, her back facing Katara. She wears the same robe as Katara and has the same hair style. Katara begins walking toward the figure. \n",
      "KATARA: Hello? Hello? Can you help me? [She squints.] Mom? [More loudly and running toward the figure.] Mom! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara runs to the figure, her eyes streaming tears of joy. She reaches the figure and places a hand on her shoulder. \n",
      "KATARA: I can't believe ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The smile leaves her face as the scene begins to lighten. Katara stands in front of a tree stump as she realizes the figure was only an illusion. Katara gasps, falling to her knees as she begins to cry. It cuts to an overhead shot of the very devastated Katara, and fades to shot of Sokka's hand holding his machete in the air. The rest of Sokka appears. \n",
      "SOKKA: Aang! [While slashing at the vines.] Stupid swamp! Dumb, ugly vines! Katara! [He becomes caught, and grunts with exertion before slicing himself free.] You think you're so tough, huh? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka trips over as he cuts through the vine in which he was tangled, falling offscreen with his face in the mud. Upon lifting up his head, he sees an image of Yue in a beam of light not far in front of him. Sokka stands up, puts away his machete and starts walking toward Yue. \n",
      "SOKKA: Hello? Yue? [He takes a hold of his head, before removing his hands and shrugging, turning away from the apparition.] This is just a trick of the light ... swamp gas ... I ... hit my head running away last night. I'm going crazy. [Almost fearfully, he turns around and walks closer.] \n",
      "PRINCESS.YUE: [Accusingly.] You didn't protect me. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka rubs his eyes in disbelief, opening them to find that Yue has disappeared. Sokka sighs in relief, but as he turns around he falls over backward, startled at seeing Yue right before his eyes again. The image of Yue disappears immediately after that and Sokka stands up and pulls his machete back out, almost threateningly.\n",
      "The scene switches to Aang, who is wandering the swamp calling the names of his friends. \n",
      "AANG: Katara! Appa! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Upon wading through the swamp, Aang notices an unfamiliar girl in a dress standing on a hill, accompanied by a winged pig. \n",
      "AANG: Hello? Who are you? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The pig flies off and the girl giggles, before turning around and running away. \n",
      "AANG: Hey, come back! [He holds his hand out as though to grab her.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang jumps to the top of the hill, only to find she has completely disappeared from his sight. Hearing her laugh again, Aang turns around only to see her running across the limbs of another tree. He uses the vines, however before he can even reach his destination, the girl has moved and is now running across the ground tries to chase the girl. Aang continues his wild chase through the treetops, as the scene switches to show Appa with Momo on his back swimming through the river that flows through the swamp. A little further on the stream, covered by fog, is a group of six swamp tribe members divided over three canoes; Due and Tho sitting in the middle canoe. They look at each other in silence for a few moments, Tho wetting his lips using his tongue. Appa halts as Momo chitters at the strange people. \n",
      "DUE: Look at that Tho. Is that a little hairy fella ridin' that thing? \n",
      "THO: No, that's what they call a \"lemoo\". Saw one at a traveling show once. Real smart they say. \n",
      "DUE: Bet he tastes a lot like possum chicken. \n",
      "THO: You think everything tastes like possum chicken. \n",
      "DUE: C'mon now, fellas. [He moves to the front of the boat.] Just a little closer. Nice and easy. Nothing to worry about. We just fixin' to eat ya. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa turns around and takes off in the opposite direction. \n",
      "THO: [Annoyed.] What'd you say that fer? \n",
      "DUE: [Shrugging as he tries to appease his friend.] Well, we are! \n",
      "THO: But you don't have to tell 'em that. \n",
      "DUE: [He shrugs again.] Well how'd I know they'd understand me? \n",
      "THO: Come on! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Due stands up in front of the canoe and starts spinning his arms, bending the water behind his canoe in order to chase Appa. The other two canoes follow suit, trailing behind Appa in a 'V' formation. Appa bounds through the river, desperate to escape the strange people hunting him. The scene switches back to Aang, who is still chasing the girl. \n",
      "AANG: Who are you? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Peering through a wall of vegetation, Aang sees the girl on a small hill. Running after her, it is too late to stop as he notices that it is not the girl, but Katara. Aang runs into the waterbender and they both fall over. Sokka hears the commotion and turns around to investigate with his machete cocked - in the wrong direction, as only a few seconds later, Aang and Katara come barreling down the root he is standing on and hit him in the back, knocking him over too. \n",
      "SOKKA: [He stands up and puts his machete away.] What do you guys think you're doing!? I've been looking all over for you! \n",
      "KATARA: [She has not moved, although her hand is on her head as she sits on the root they have fallen onto.] Well, I've been wandering around looking for you! \n",
      "AANG: [He looks away before airbending himself to his feet. He appears embarrassed that he was not actively searching for his friends like they were him.] I was chasing some girl. \n",
      "KATARA: What girl? \n",
      "AANG: [He walks over to Katara and helps her up before rubbing his ear.] I don't know. I heard laughing and I saw some girl in a fancy dress. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sarcastically, with exaggerated hand movements.] Well, there must be a tea party here and we just didn't get our invitations! \n",
      "KATARA: I thought I saw Mom. \n",
      "SOKKA: Look, we were all just scared and hungry and our minds were playing tricks on us. That's why we all saw things out here. \n",
      "KATARA: [Surprised.] You saw something too? \n",
      "SOKKA: [He looks away for a moment, before turning back and taking a step closer to his sister.] I thought I saw Yue. But, that doesn't prove anything. Look, I think about her all the time, and you saw Mom, someone you miss a lot. \n",
      "AANG: What about me? I didn't know the girl I saw. And all our visions led us right here. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang begins walking around, as if looking for something. \n",
      "KATARA: Okay ... so where's here? The middle of the swamp? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang looks around, his gaze finally resting on a massive tree growing right next to him. The camera pans to reveal exactly how enormous the tree really is. \n",
      "AANG: Yeah, the center ... it's the heart of the swamp. It's been calling us here. I knew it. \n",
      "SOKKA: It's just a tree. [He raises his arms above his head.] It can't call anyone. For the last time, there's nothing after us and there's nothing magical happening here. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As Sokka finishes his tirade, a seaweed monster jumps out from the water. The gang huddles together and screams, separating as the monster begins to attack them. The seaweed monster goes after Sokka first as the trio split up, each running in different directions. Sokka is picked up and swung around, only being released as Aang uses airbending to slice part of the monster's arm off. The monster goes after Aang, flicking the monk away and into the surrounding trees. Sokka is shown fighting with the vines that had him captured only seconds ago, and so intent was he at destroying them, he failed to notice a column rising behind himself. The column attaches to the seaweed monster and Sokka is swiped from the ground. Katara comes to his rescue this time as she slices at the monster's arm. It did not have the desired effect, as more vines grew to patch up the hole her waterbending created. She manages to push the monster back a little, however it is not long before she is flung away. Aang stops to watch her, giving the monster time to attack him. Sokka is absorbed into the chest of the monster as the scene changes to Appa continuing his escape from the Foggy Swamp members. Momo throws objects at them from the back of his friend, attempting to slow them down. One of these such items was a shirt that appears to belong to Sokka at a Foggy Swamp member, resulting in the boat that member was on to spin out of control. \n",
      "THO: Now, what would a lemoo need a shirt fer? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Tho manages to capture Momo after the latter hits a low tree branch and is thrown backward. The loss of his friend encourages Appa to run faster. The scene changes back to the gang fighting the seaweed monster. After using a tornado-like airbending move, Katara freezes Sokka in place before shooting him with water, expelling him from the monster's body. The fight ends as Katara begins to waterbend repeatedly at the monster, slicing through the vines and not allowing the monster to regenerate. A person is seen inside the monster, bending the vines. \n",
      "SOKKA: There's someone in there! He's bending the vines! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: With a final slice, Katara cuts through the mask on the seaweed monster, the whole top half falling off. However, this does not stop the monster, and vines spring out of the marsh, capturing Katara high on a pillar. Aang airbends over to the monster and, using his native bending, rips apart the vines. \n",
      "AANG: [Demanding offensively.] Why did you call me here if you just wanted to kill us!? \n",
      "HUU: Wait! [The vines drop to reveal a slightly larger man wearing nothing but a leaf loincloth.] I didn't call you here. \n",
      "AANG: [He shares a look of confusion with Sokka, who is also in an offensive stance.] We were flying over and I heard something calling to me, telling me to land. \n",
      "SOKKA: He's the Avatar. Stuff like that happens to us a lot. \n",
      "HUU: The Avatar? Come with me. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The trio drop their stances and look at each other. The scene cuts to Huu, leading the gang to the top of the giant tree Aang noticed earlier. \n",
      "KATARA: So, who are you then? \n",
      "HUU: [Bending a vine out of the way.] I protect the swamp from folks that want to hurt it, like this fella with his big knife. \n",
      "SOKKA: See, completely reasonable. [He finally puts his machete away.] Not a monster, just a regular guy defending his home. Nothing mystical about it. \n",
      "HUU: Oh the swamp is a mystical place all right. It's sacred. I reached enlightenment right here under the banyan-grove tree. [He sits on the tree, looking at the group as he explains.] I heard it calling me, just like you did. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Humoring Huu.] Sure you did. It seems real chatty. \n",
      "HUU: [The camera zooms out as he explains, slowly revealing more and more of the swamp. It shows how large the banyan-grove tree is compared to the others, but at the final magnification, it is impossible to distinguish it from the other trees.] See this whole swamp is actually just one tree spread out over miles. Branches spread and sink, take root, and spread some more. One big, living organism. Just like the entire world. \n",
      "AANG: [Cuts back to Aang, looking at Huu. He is still openly skeptical.] I get how the tree is one big thing, but the whole world? \n",
      "HUU: Sure. You think you're any different from me or your friends or this tree? If you listen hard enough, you can hear every living thing breathing together. [Another shot shows the swamp river. There are the sounds of several animals heard in the background.] You can feel everything growing. We're all living together, even if most folks don't act like it. We all have the same roots and we are all branches of the same tree. \n",
      "KATARA: [She and her friends are now sitting, listening to Huu.] But what did our visions mean? \n",
      "HUU: In the swamp, we see visions of people we've lost, people we loved, folks we think are gone. [The shot cuts to show the people that Sokka and Katara saw in the swamp, before cutting back to Huu.] But the swamp tells us they're not. We're still connected to them. Time is an illusion and so is death. \n",
      "AANG: But what about my vision? It was someone I had never met. \n",
      "HUU: You're the Avatar. You tell me. \n",
      "AANG: [He looks down as he tries to understand.] Time is an illusion. So, it's someone I will meet. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Huu nods. \n",
      "SOKKA: Sorry to interrupt the lesson, but we still need to find Appa and Momo. \n",
      "AANG: I think I know how to find them. [Aang kneels down and places his hand on the tree.] Everything is connected. [Energy travels from Aang's hand to Appa's location. Appa is seen being captured by the Foggy Swamp members. Back at the banyan-grove tree, Aang stands up.] Come on! We've got to hurry! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back to the Foggy Swamp members, Appa is trapped inside a net while Tho sings. \n",
      "THO: [Singing and tapping the side of his canoe. Momo is seen struggling inside the sack he has been placed in.] Set my lines by the river bed! Caught ten fish and I killed 'em dead! Cut 'em and gut 'em and I tossed the heads in the water to keep them catgators fed. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The boats stop when a jet of water appears and destroys the boat next to Tho and Due's. The two people from the destroyed boat fly into the water as Aang appears on a tree branch. \n",
      "AANG: Appa! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang airbends a stream of air, throwing Tho into the water and freeing Momo who was being held by Tho. \n",
      "DUE: We're under attack! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Due scoops up a puddle of water and sends it toward Aang and Katara. The three become engaged in a waterbending fight, with neither side gaining an advantage. \n",
      "KATARA: Hey, you guys are waterbenders! \n",
      "DUE: You too! That means we're kin! [Due ceases waterbending, followed by a slightly disgusted Katara. He watches as Sokka and Huu run up to the branch Katara and Aang are standing on.] Hey Huu! How you been? \n",
      "HUU: You know, scared some folks, swung some vines, the usual. \n",
      "SOKKA: Huu? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to the gang sitting around a fire in the Foggy Swamp Tribe. There is a member waterbending some liquid in a pot to stirs it, and Due grabs a fish from the pot before moving over to the fire. \n",
      "DUE: How you like that possum chicken? \n",
      "SOKKA: Tastes just like arctic hen. So why were you guys so interested in eating Appa? [He indicates the catgator lying behind Tho.] You've got plenty of those big things wandering around. \n",
      "DUE: You want me to eat old Slim? He's like a member of the family! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Due pulls the fish off the branch and gives it to Slim. \n",
      "SOKKA: Nice Slim! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka throws a bug at the catgator; it bounces off his nose and he growls at Sokka, who cowers slightly. \n",
      "DUE: [Laughing.] Oh, he don't eat no bugs! That's people food. \n",
      "THO: Where'd you say you was from? \n",
      "KATARA: [Smiling. Sokka is shown chewing nonchalantly next to her.] The South Pole. \n",
      "THO: Didn't know there was waterbenders anywhere but here. They got a nice swamp there, do they? \n",
      "KATARA: No, it's all ice and snow. \n",
      "THO: Hmm. No wonder you left. \n",
      "SOKKA: [To Katara.] Well, I hope you realize now that nothing strange was going on here. [He raises his arms for emphasis.] Just a bunch of greasy people living in a swamp. \n",
      "KATARA: What about the visions? \n",
      "SOKKA: I told you, we were hungry. I'm eating a giant bug! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka holds up said giant bug, taking a bit of its abdomen. He swallows it with some difficulty before exhaling sharply, sticking his tongue out. \n",
      "AANG: [Feeding Momo.] But what about when the tree showed me where Appa and Momo were? \n",
      "SOKKA: That's Avatar stuff, that doesn't count. [To Huu.] The only thing I can't figure out is how you made that tornado that sucked us down. \n",
      "HUU: I can't do anything like that. I just bend the water in the plants. \n",
      "SOKKA: Well, no accounting for weather. Still, there's absolutely nothing mysterious about the swamp. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a long shot of the camp from across the river. The white screaming bird from earlier lands on a visible tree branch and lets out its horrible cry. A nearby vine rises up and bats the bird into the camera, which goes dark.\n",
      "When the image returns, it is of a full moon back in the Earth Kingdom village where Zuko and Iroh were seen last. The camera pans down to reveal the broadsword man walking down a street alone. He hears something behind him, turns and draws his blades. The scene cuts to a frontal shot of him, where there was nothing behind him. \n",
      "BROADSWORD.MAN: Who's there? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to a close-up shot of his hands, which are both grabbed by another person. He is disarmed and thrown against some nearby boxes, his swords falling uselessly to the ground. His assailant's feet are seen to approach the sword. He picks them up, the camera in turn reveals that the assailant is the Blue Spirit himself. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fades to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode begins by showing a coast before panning down to in the middle of a forest where the gang is asleep, except for Momo. Switch to a view from inside Sokka's open mouth, looking out. A spider has set up its web over his mouth. Momo discovers the spider and inspects it with great interest. When a flies lands on the web, Momo tries to grab it. As he plunges his hand completely in Sokka's mouth, Sokka opens his eyes immediately in surprise. He shoots up and starts to spit out the remains of the spider and its web. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Angrily.] What are you doing in my mouth? [Momo chitters happily while lying upside down on Sokka's belly, chewing on the fly he \"rescued\" from the spider's web.] Momo, you need to be a little more sensitive to my boundaries. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The lemur seems to notice something else on his left. He completely ignores Sokka's comment and climbs on his face, where he erects himself and pricks up his ears to determine what it is he heard. He chitters loudly, waking up Katara, who was sleeping on a nearby sawed off tree trunk.\n",
      "Switch to Aang, who is still sleeping soundly on Appa's forearm. He wakes up as the ground begins to shake. Kahchi, sitting atop a rhino, jumps out of the thicket. Katara gasps as two more emerge from the bushes on the other side of the camp. \n",
      "MONGKE: [Shouting from up above as he looks over the campsite.] Give up! You're completely surrounded! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: An overview shot of the campsite shows that four rhinos are circling around the gang.\n",
      "Close-up of Vachir, as he fires two flaming arrows toward Sokka, who was trying to crawl away like a caterpillar in his sleeping bag. The arrows pin the back of the sleeping bag to the ground while Sokka crawls out. He moves out of the path of a third arrow just in time. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Crawling toward Appa.] Come on! Come on! Come on! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka climbs aboard Appa, where Aang's already waiting for him. Switch to a closer shot of Katara, as she also makes her way toward Appa. Just before she reaches him, she stops in her tracks and turns around.\n",
      "Kahchi spins his Guan Dao around and plants it in the sawed of tree trunk Katara was sleeping on a bit earlier. Next to the tree trunk lie some of Team Avatar's supplies. \n",
      "KATARA: My scrolls! \n",
      "AANG: [Shocked.] My staff! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He jumps off Appa's head, while Sokka just manages to get on.\n",
      "Switch to the Guan Dao blade into the stump, right next to a wooden box. The camera pans to the right to reveal Katara charging Kahchi with a water whip. She freezes the blade solid to the trunk, giving her the opportunity to grab the box of scrolls. She heads back toward Appa just as Kahchi manages to break his weapon free of the ice.\n",
      "Cut to Ogodei, who is swinging his chains around. He throws them around a tree and pulls it down to impede Aang's progress toward his staff. It has no effect, as Aang just somersaults over the fallen tree.\n",
      "Close-up of Yeh-Lu, as he ignites one of the hand grenades hanging on his belt. He throws it at Aang, who has reached his staff by now. The explosive lands right beside him, but the fuse is still burning. Aang swirls his staff around and knocks the explosive out of the way and into the woods. Aang propels himself into the air with airbending while the bomb explodes. He lands on Appa's head. \n",
      "AANG: Yip yip! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa rises from the ground, leaving the Rough Rhinos behind. Mongke shoots a fire ball at them as they fly over. Katara and Sokka quickly duck and cover their heads, as the fire ball just misses them. As Sokka erects again, he notices something on the ground. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Stretching out his arm over the saddle as if he wants to grab it.] Wait, my boomerang! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera zooms out on Sokka's boomerang, which still lies in the middle of their besieged camp. \n",
      "KATARA: [Grabbing Sokka's arm.] There's no time! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Annoyed.] Oh, I see, [Turning to Katara.] so there's time to get your scrolls [Turning toward Aang.] and time to get your staff, [Looking back at Katara with his hand on his chest.] but no time for my boomerang? \n",
      "KATARA: [Cheerfully.] That's correct! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Bowing his head in defeat by this totally honest answer.] Oh. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a shot of Mongke, who angrily turns his head as Appa disappears at the horizon.\n",
      "Screen changes to a small village at the edge of a cliff, surrounded by open, green fields. Appa landed nearby a small, wooden house. \n",
      "AANG: [To a sulking Sokka.] Sorry about your boomerang, Sokka. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Camera moves back to show how Sokka sits on the ground in a gloomy mood. Katara is buying supplies is the background. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sadly.] I feel like I've lost part of my identity. [He jumps up and moves Aang's hat slightly so that he can point at Aang's arrow.] Imagine if you lost your arrow, or Katara lost her ... [Makes a hair loopies gesture with a somewhat bored look.] hair loopies. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He slowly saunters over to the stall, where Katara gives him a loving hug in order to comfort him before she holding her hands in front of herself while smiling lovely at Sokka. \n",
      "MERCHANT: Here's your produce, ponytail guy. \n",
      "SOKKA: [He picks up the basket full of supplies, looking dejected at the nickname.] I used to be boomerang guy ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang and Katara follow Sokka with looks of sympathy as he walks away. The merchant heads toward Katara, who gives him some money. \n",
      "MERCHANT: [Surprised, after inspecting the money.] Hey, Water Tribe money! \n",
      "KATARA: I hope that's okay. \n",
      "MERCHANT: [Clutching the coin.] So long as it's money. [The merchant closes his shop, while Katara walks over to Aang, who is trying to console a crying Sokka as the camera pans up to show just the merchant's head.] Have a nice Avatar Day! \n",
      "AANG: [Interested.] Avatar Day? \n",
      "MERCHANT: [Turning around while waving.] You guys are going to the festival, right? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They all look at each other for a moment, trying to figure out what to do. Aang and Katara smile at each other, while tears still run over Sokka's face.\n",
      "The camera pans down to reveal an overview shot of Chin Village. Switch to a shot of several festive, green lanterns hanging over the street. The shot tilts down. Aang, Katara, and Sokka are standing in the middle of the busy street, looking around in interest. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They turn around as a large effigy of Avatar Kyoshi rolls by. \n",
      "KATARA: [Pointing at the float.] Look! They made a giant Kyoshi float! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They run to the side. Switch to a close-up of Kyoshi's head. Aang, Sokka and Katara emerge from a side street. \n",
      "SOKKA: And here comes Avatar Roku! [Roku effigy rolls by.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Overview shot of the main square that is packed with people. The giant float of Kyoshi and Roku are being pulled to the middle. \n",
      "AANG: Having a huge festival in your honor is great, but frankly, it's just nice to be appreciated. \n",
      "SOKKA: And it's nice to appreciate their deep-fried festival food! [He takes a huge bite out of the food-item he is holding.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Pointing at a giant float of Aang coming down the street.] Aang, look! \n",
      "AANG: That's the biggest me I've ever seen! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Close-up as Aang's float pulls up besides that of the other two Avatars on the main square. The camera pans to the right of the floats as a villager carrying a torch comes running down the street. \n",
      "SOKKA: Now a torch, that's a nice prop. It's bright, dangerous ... [Sniffs.] smells manly. But I'm not sure I could carry it off. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka takes another bite of his food as Katara points at the runner. \n",
      "KATARA: [Surprised.] Hey, what's that guy doing? \n",

      "VILLAGERS: [Chanting as Kyoshi's effigy is consumed by the flames.] Down with the Avatar! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The villagers continue chanting while the runner sets fire to the Roku effigy next. The camera zooms in on Aang, Katara, and Sokka, who are utterly shocked by the turn of events. Sokka's mouth falls open and food drips out.\n",
      "Cut to a shot of another town atop a hill. As two people are walking down the quiet street, a shadowy figure quickly passes them by on the roof. The Blue Spirit lands in front of the two people and unsheathes his dual dao swords as he jumps at the man carrying two baskets, suspended on a long pole. He swiftly cuts the baskets off in one fluid motion. The terrified man cowers back, as the Blue Spirit moves in to collect his prize. He hangs the baskets over his shoulders and heads for the woman, who is carrying a large piece of fruit on her head. The Blue Spirit snatches the fruit off her head and disappears as swiftly as he had come. The man and woman are left in confusion as to what just happened.\n",
      "Switch to a scene in the forest. The camera follows the descent of a fly that is snatched out of the air by a chameleon resting on a branch. The Blue Spirit is making his way through the thicket. The mask of the Blue Spirit is placed in a hollow part at the base of a tree. Zuko peeks around the trunk. The camera zooms toward a cavern where Iroh is sitting. He looks up when Zuko drops the barrels of food at his feet. \n",
      "IROH: [Wondering.] Where did you get these? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Angrily, while walking away.] What does it matter where they came from? \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Switch back to the burning effigies of the Avatars in Chin Village as the chants continue. The mayor signals to the torch-bearer, who is now on the roof, to throw his torch. The torch-bearer grins as he takes aim and throws his torch with a grunt right into the right eye of Aang's float. The crowd cheers in approval, while Aang looks at his own effigy burn with a look of pain on his face, closing his own right eye. Katara runs to the front and uses her waterbending to extinguish the flames with water from two large pots nearby. \n",
      "VILLAGER: [Angrily pointing an accusing finger at Katara.] That party pooper's ruining Avatar Day! \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Camera zooms in slowly on the mayor. \n",
      "TONG: [Calmly.] I find that hard to swallow, [Raising his voice.] considering what you did to us in your past life! It was Avatar Kyoshi; she murdered our glorious leader, Chin the Great. \n",
      "AANG: [Utterly shocked.] You think that I ... murdered someone? \n",
      "VILLAGER.#2: [Lisping and slurring.] We used to be a great society before you killed our leader. [Pointing at himself as the camera zooms in on him.] Now look at us! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The villagers next to him look at him in disgust. \n",
      "AANG: [Frightened by the appearances of the old man.] Huh! \n",
      "KATARA: [Katara places her arms on Aang's shoulders and starts to defend him.] Aang would never do something like that. No Avatar would. [Shaking her head in disapproval before pointing an accusing finger at the villagers.] And it's not fair for you all to question his honor! \n",
      "VILLAGER.#3: [Raising his arm to emphasize his remark.] Let's tell her what we all think of the Avatar's \"honor\"! \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Close-up of Aang's face. His confident look quickly disappears as the camera cuts to the next shot, where he is cuffed with his hands and head stuck in a wooden panel and thrown behind bars. Katara holds her hand before her eyes in shame while Sokka leans against the prison bars. His arms are crossed and he looks annoyed at Aang. \n",
      "AANG: [Apologetically.] How was I supposed to know they wouldn't take Water Tribe money? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a panning down shot of the panoramic view of the village. The frame freezes for a moment on the open prison courtyard, where Aang's tunic is clearly visible. Switch to a shot from inside the prison, where Sokka, Katara, and Momo are still standing before the chained up Aang. \n",
      "SOKKA: So some people don't like you, big deal! There's a whole nation of firebenders who hate you. Now let's bust you out of here! \n",

He moves to the back of the room to \"cut\" the air.] swish-swish-swish! [He makes a grotesque movement with his arm before thrusting his face in the camera.] Airbending slice! [He resumes his place beside Katara, who is still looking annoyed by her brother. He makes a circular motion with his hands and points toward the door.] And we're on our way! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang looks at Sokka with big eyes. \n",
      "KATARA: [Slightly mocking.] I think what \"Master Swish\" is trying to say [Serious tone as she looks at Aang.] is that you're supposed to be out saving the world. You can't do that locked up in here. \n",
      "AANG: [Unhappy.] I can't do that with people thinking I'm a murderer either. I need you guys to help prove my innocence. \n",
      "SOKKA: How're we gonna to do that? The crime happened over three hundred years ago. \n",
      "AANG: [Cunningly.] That's okay, Sokka. For some reason, I thought you were an expert detective. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Content.] Well, I guess I could be classified as such. \n",
      "KATARA: [Aiding Aang by playing Sokka's ego.] Yeah! Back home, he was famous for solving the mystery of the missing seal jerky. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Bragging.] Everyone wanted to blame it on the polar leopard, but I figured out it was Old Man Jarko wearing polar leopard boots! [Katara holds her hand to her brow, annoyed by Sokka's monologue.] See, a real eight hundred-pound polar leopard would have left much deeper tracks. [Aang is making fun of Sokka, Katara holds her hand to her mouth to refrain herself from bursting out in laughs.] Okay, I guess I am pretty good. \n",
      "AANG: So, you'll help me with my case? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Pretends to ponder about the question. Katara stares at him, trying to figure out what he is doing.] Fine! But I'm going to need some new props. [The camera spins around. When it stops again, Sokka is wearing a hat with a monocle.] I'm ready. [Katara looks surprised at his new outfit and giggles. Sokka extends his monocle to investigate her.] What? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a wagon being pulled by an ostrich horse through the forest. An Earth Kingdom soldier sits in the front, holding the reins. Switch to the inside of the wagon, where a wealthy man in playing with his chest full of gold pieces. He is thrown to the front when the cart suddenly stops. The man looks around in fear, quickly closing and locking the chest with the precious metal. His scared eyes shift from side to side to as he hears rumbling noises outside. He clutches the chest protectively. The cold sweat is dripping down his face. He sighs in relieve as the noise died down, but he swiftly cowers back in fear as two swords pierce the top of the cart. A fist comes crashing down through the ceiling. When the aghast man looks up, he sees that it were the blades of the Blue Spirit that wrecked his cart. He anxiously holds up his treasury toward the Blue Spirit, while trying to stay away from him as far as possible. The Blue Spirit snatches it out of his hands and disappears, leaving the surprised man. The camera moves back to reveal the shocked man in his chart and the unconscious soldier on the ground.\n",
      "Cut back to a panoramic view of Chin Village, lying at the edge of the tall cliff and surrounded by pastures of green. Switch to on overview shot of a patch of sand, right outside the village wall. Three people are standing nearby a small shrine. \n",
      "TONG: This is the crime scene. [Cut to Sokka, who inquisitively looks around. He gazes directly into the camera lens through his magnifying glass, making his left eye appear huge. He moves on to investigate the walls of the shrine, while the mayor is standing at the edge of the cliff, pointing down at something.] This is the footprint of the killer, Kyoshi. [Sokka quickly squats beside the footprint to take a closer look at it.] It was at sunset, 370 years ago today, that she emerged from the temple, and struck down Chin the Great. After that tragic day, we built this statue to immortalize our great leader. [They all look up at a statue of Chin the Great, who has a raised left hand in triumph.] Feel free to appreciate it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The mayor leaves Katara and Sokka alone to investigate things further. Sokka moves in to examine the statue from every possible angle, while Katara looks curiously at him. Sokka is investigating the base of the statue, when something catches his attention. He looks through his magnifying monocle in order to take a better look at the right foot of the statue. His eyes widen as he makes a discovery. He swiftly runs over to the shrine that is facing the statue and examines the stone it is made of. \n",
      "SOKKA: This temple and this statue were cut from the same stone. [Runs back over to the statue.] And we know that the statue was built after Chin died. \n",
      "KATARA: [Excitedly drawing her conclusions.] So if they were built at the same time, that means– \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka interrupts her before she can reach a conclusion. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Shouting.] Shhh! I wanna solve it! [Pointing at the temple.] That means Kyoshi never set foot in this temple! \n",
      "KATARA: That's a big hole in the mayor's story, [Disappointed.] but it's not enough to prove Aang's innocence. \n",
      "SOKKA: You're right. [Blows soap bubbles with his dragon shaped pipe, while thinking about their next course of action.] We need to go to Kyoshi Island. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara walks in the frame, looking at his pipe. \n",
      "KATARA: [Surprised.] Where did you get that? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the prison in which Aang is being held. An elephant rat sniffles his way over to an acorn. He picks it up and jumps away. Aang, still cuffed, leans dispirited against the wall of the prison. A low voice emerges from the shadows at the other side of the prison. \n",
      "SCARY.PRISONER: You got a bald head. [Aang looks up in wonder to see who is talking. Switch to Aang's angle of view. A man is standing in the shadows, only his outline is visible.] Some nice tattoos. [The man emerges from the shadows. He has a strong build, earrings in both ears, and his body has a large snake tattoo that covers the top of his chest and down his right arm. He suddenly charges Aang, letting out a load growl. He is stopped in his tracks by the chains around his neck. Aang slides down the wall in fear, while the man addresses him calmly.] You're going to fit in real well around here. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang smiles awkwardly as the man balls his fist.\n",
      "Switch to an overview of Kyoshi Island. A man in the watchtower signals the approach of Appa by ringing a bell. Cut to a shot of Oyaji's house as Appa's shadow slides over it. The man looks up. Two laughing, little children pass him on their way to great Appa and his riders. Appa lands right in front of the large, wooden statue of Kyoshi which is completely rebuilt. When Appa touches the ground, everyone in the village has gathered around to great them. They are all clapping as The foaming mouth guy makes it to the front. He sees Appa and all he can do is squeal. He gestures toward Appa in wonder, before letting out a load squeal and starts to foam before fainting. Some of the villagers look at him while doing his thing, feeling awkwardly. Sokka waves at the people. Koko, who was standing in the front with her hands raised high, notices that something is off. \n",
      "KOKO: [Angrily stamping her foot on the ground.] Where's Aangy? \n",
      "KATARA: [Gently breaks the news to Koko.] He couldn't be here, Koko. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The villagers sigh in disappointment. \n",
      "KOKO: [Nagging.] I wanted to see Aangy ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The foaming mouth guy woozily stands up again, staggering a bit. He looks from left to right, wipes the foam of his face and pulls his tunic over his head, before subtly sneaking away. The rest of the villagers do the same with the exception of Oyaji. \n",
      "KATARA: Oyaji! Aang is in jail. The town of Chin says he murdered their leader in a past life. \n",
      "SOKKA: They say it was Kyoshi. \n",
      "OYAJI: [Shocked.] Kyoshi? That's crazy talk! I'll take you to her shrine. Maybe something there will help you clear her name. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The threesome is walking up a gentle slope. \n",
      "SOKKA: [With feigned casualness.] So, uh ... what's Suki up to? Is she around? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka looks around while Katara gives him a loving smile. \n",
      "OYAJI: Actually, she and the other warriors left to fight in the war. You kids had a big impact on Suki. She said you inspired her and she wanted to help change the world. \n",
      "SOKKA: [He disappointedly slants his eyes.] Oh, well ... that's great. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They walk under a large paifang gate toward a temple at the top of a hill. \n",
      "OYAJI: This temple was converted into a shrine to Kyoshi. The clerics tell us these relics are still connected to her spirit. That's her kimono. \n",
      "KATARA: [Approvingly.] She had exquisite taste. \n",
      "OYAJI: Please don't touch! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara quickly lets go of the robe. \n",
      "SOKKA: These fans ... [He picks up one of the fans and waves it back and forth.] They were her weapons, no? \n",
      "OYAJI: [Sternly.] Also refrain from touching the fans. \n",
      "KATARA: [Squatting beside a really big pair of brown boots.] These were her boots? Her feet must have been enormous! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo peeks out one of them. Katara looks surprised to see him there. \n",
      "OYAJI: [Proudly.] The biggest of any Avatar. \n",
      "KATARA: [Realizing something.] Wait a minute ... big feet? [A flashback shows the much smaller footprint they saw at the edge of the cliff outside Chin Village.] Little footprint? [She happily exclaims her findings.] There's no way– \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka clears his throat to cut her off. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Annoyed.] Special outfit? Hat and pipe? These things mean anything to you? \n",
      "KATARA: [Sarcastically.] You're right. I'm sorry. [She bows slightly in a mocking gesture.] Please. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Dramatically raises his hand in the air.] Aha! [Showing his own boots to Oyaji.] There's no way Kyoshi could have made that footprint. [Moves toward Katara to explain everything to her.] And therefore there is nothing linking her to the crime scene. \n",
      "KATARA: [Unimpressed.] Brilliant, Sokka. [Rolls her eyes.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut back to an overview shot of Chin Village at sundown. Aang is sitting in a circle with three other inmates. \n",
      "SCARY.PRISONER: [In a very friendly voice that does not stroke with his scary appearances.] This girl you're talking about? She'll come around. You just gotta hang in there. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang removes his head and hands out of the wooden panel. \n",
      "AANG: [Hopeful.] You think so? \n",
      "SCARY.PRISONER: Sure. \n",
      "PRISONER.#2: Yeah. \n",
      "SENSITIVE.RUFFIAN: You're a catch. \n",
      "AANG: [Doubtful.] I don't know ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He rests his head on the board. \n",
      "SCARY.PRISONER: Hey! You're smart, handsome, funny. Not to mention you're the Avatar. \n",
      "AANG: [Smiling sincerely.] You guys are great. \n",
      "SENSITIVE.RUFFIAN: [Tears stream down his face while he talk in a very soft voice.] Don't be afraid to tell her how you feel. [He dries his tears and sniffs.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Switch back to Kyoshi's shrine at Kyoshi Island. Oyaji brings Sokka's and Katara's attention to a painting that depicts Kyoshi and some of the villagers. \n",
      "OYAJI: This piece is called \"The Birth of Kyoshi\". [Sokka investigates the painting thoroughly.] It was painted at sunrise on this day this island was founded. Why, it was today in fact, three hundred and seventy years ago. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sokka spins around in shock, spitting out some of the bubbles he swallowed. Very surprised.] Three hundred and seventy years? Wait, [He grabs Oyaji by his collar.] are you sure it was today? \n",
      "OYAJI: Oh, seeing how it's Kyoshi Day, yes, [He pulls himself free from Sokka's grasp and throws him back a little.] I'm sure. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Staring at the painting again.] This ceremony didn't take place at sunrise. It took place at sunset. [Addresses Katara.] Look at the shadows. \n",
      "KATARA: They point east. So the sun must have been in the west. \n",
      "OYAJI: So what? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Shoves Katara out of the way as she yelps.] If Kyoshi was in the ceremony at sunset, she couldn't have been in Chin committing the crime. She has an alibi! [Points his pipe dramatically toward the camera upon making his conclusion.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara grabs the pipe out of his hand and slams him hard on the head with it causing him to fall down.\n",
      "Cut to a far off shot of Chin Village by night. The camera moves in slowly and keeps zooming forward, even when the picture changes to inside the prison. Sokka and Katara confront the mayor with their findings, while Aang listens intently at the bars. \n",
      "KATARA: Honorable Mayor, we've prepared a solid defense for the Avatar. We did an investigation and found some very strong evidence. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: While Katara talks, a broadly smiling Sokka leans in toward Aang and points at himself to emphasize that he was the one that discovered the evidence. Aang flashes his teeth in return. \n",
      "TONG: Evidence? [Dismissive.] Hmph! That's not how our court system works. \n",
      "AANG: Then how can I prove my innocence? \n",
      "TONG: Simple. I say what happened [He points to himself, before pointing to Aang.], then you say what happened, and then I decide who's right. [Everyone gasps at once, horrified by this news.] That's why we call it justice. Because it's \"just us.\" \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The mayor exits the room, laughing maniacally, leaving Sokka, Katara and Aang standing there with their mouths wide open in shock.\n",
      "Cut to an overview of the amphitheater, the statue of Chin and the temple on the edge of the cliff. Switch to a back shot of the mayor. The camera pans to the left to reveal that every villager has gathered in the amphitheater. Katara and Sokka are seen sitting at the front. \n",
      "TONG: [Emotionally.] Everyone loved Chin the Great because he was so great. Then the Avatar showed up and killed him, and that's how it happened. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He walks away with a giant smile on his face. \n",
      "GUARD: [Very deep, monotone voice.] The accused will now present its argument. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Raises his hand before his mouth to say some quiet, encouraging words.] You can do it, Aang. Just remember the evidence. \n",
      "AANG: [Still tied up, unsure.] Right ... evidence. [He shifts his eyes to the left while he is trying to remember what to say. Enthusiastically.] Ladies and gentlemen ... I'm about to tell you what really happened. And I will prove it with facts. Fact number one. [Raises his finger to count along but blanks out.] Uhhh ... \n",
      "SOKKA: [Whispers.] The footprint! \n",
      "AANG: Oh, yeah. You see ... I have very large feet. [The camera tilts down to reveal his small feet. The villagers are unimpressed by his argument.] Furthermore ... your temple matches your statue. [The villagers look from one to the other, not knowing where Aang is going with this.] But ... I was in a painting at sunset. [He quickly ends his exposition with a big smile.] So, there you have it, I'm not guilty. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera switches view from Aang to the unimpressed crowd, to pan further down toward Sokka and Katara, both with big smiles on their faces, but their eyes reveal that they are fake. Sokka gives Aang a \"thumbs up\" gesture. Momo sits on Katara's lap, looking very confused. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Mumbles to Katara while they continue to smile.] He's dead. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Zuko's and Iroh's hideout in the forest. Zuko sits next to the campfire as Iroh walks into the cave to inspect a new tea set. \n",
      "IROH: Looks like you did some serious shopping. [He picks up a big, gold-colored teapot.] But where did you get the money? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Lazily resting against a tree trunk.] Do you like your new teapot? \n",
      "IROH: To be honest with you [He puts the pot down.], the best tea tastes delicious whether it comes in a porcelain pot or a tin cup. [Iroh walks over to Zuko and squats down beside him.] I know we've had some difficult times lately. We've had to struggle just to get by. [Places a hand on Zuko's shoulder who closes his eyes as if he was holding something back.] But it's nothing to be ashamed of. There is a simple honor in poverty. \n",
      "ZUKO: There's no honor for me without the Avatar. \n",
      "IROH: Zuko ... [Sighs.] Even if you did capture the Avatar, I'm not so sure it would solve our problems. Not now. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Turns away from his uncle.] Then there is no hope at all. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko wants to stand up and leave the cave, but Iroh grabs him by the shoulders and sits him down. \n",
      "IROH: No, Zuko! You must never give in to despair. Allow yourself to slip down that road and you surrender to your lowest instincts. [Zuko bows his head as he listens to his uncle's wisdom.] In the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself. That is the meaning of inner strength. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko turns to face his uncle, who looks back at him with a sad look upon his face. Abruptly, Zuko pulls free from Iroh's grasp and heads out into the forest.\n",
      "Switch back to an overview shot of Chin Village. \n",
      "KATARA: Mayor Tong, I'd like for the court to hear one last testimony. \n",
      "TONG: I've already told you, it's just me and the accused. You can't call any witnesses! \n",
      "KATARA: This isn't just any witness. I'm going to call ... [Spreads her arms.] Avatar Kyoshi herself! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The villagers murmur among themselves while someone exits the temple. The guard escorts Aang in Kyoshi costume, to the front.\n",
      "Close-up a skeptical looking mayor. As Katara sits back down, Sokka leans toward her, pointing at Aang. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Whispering.] What are you doing? \n",
      "KATARA: [Hopeful.] Well, she is Aang's past life. Maybe wearing her stuff will trigger something. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Plays with his magnifying glass.] I do believe in the power of stuff. \n",
      "TONG: [Angry.] This is a mockery of Chin Law! \n",
      "KATARA: [Pleading.] Please! If you could just wait one more second, I'm sure Kyoshi will be here! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Switch to Aang who is standing in the middle of the square, hiding his face behind one of Kyoshi's fans. He peeks over the fan. \n",
      "AANG: [Higher pitch.] Hey, everybody! Avatar Kyoshi here. [Rapidly blinks his eyes.] \n",
      "TONG: [Walking over to Aang.] This is ridiculous! [Points at Aang while he addresses the audience.] For the murder of Chin the Great, this court finds the Avatar– \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang looks down in defeat, but is suddenly engulfed in a tornado of earth. Tong holds on to his hat to prevent it from being blown away. The sky darkens and when the tornado dies down, Aang is gone and the spirit of Kyoshi has taken his place. \n",
      "KYOSHI: I killed Chin the Conqueror. [A flashback shows how Chin earthbends an earth column beneath one of his subjects as he was offering something to Chin. Voice-over.] A horrible tyrant, Chin was expanding his army to all corners of the continent. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A close-up of Chin the Great fades to a shot of a map, where the trail of his campaign can be seen. He had concurred everything save to Ba Sing Se. The scene switches to a large army standing by the shores of the sea, ready to attack when given the order. \n",
      "KYOSHI: When they came to the neck of the peninsula where we lived, he demanded our immediate surrender. [Kyoshi calmly walks toward him to face his challenge.] I warned him that I would not sit passively while he took our home. But he did not back down. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Chin and Kyoshi stand face to face. Kyoshi is around a foot bigger than him. Chin takes a fighting stance, but Kyoshi is unimpressed. She grabs one of her fans and points it at him. A powerful gust of wind washes over the surprised Chin and strips him of all his clothes, except for his underwear. \n",
      "KYOSHI: On that day, we split from the mainland. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Close-up of Avatar Kyoshi as her eyes glow for a second, signaling the Avatar State. She jumps up and stretches one of her fans to the left as she lands. A powerful fissure rips through the earth and explodes at the edge of the cliff. She repeats that move to the right now with the same effect. Kyoshi calmly closes her fans and slams them into the ground, causing the whole peninsula to shake. Chin still stands in his earthbending stance.\n",
      "The camera shoots from inside the ground as it opens up to reveal how Kyoshi made a large crack in the earth. With a series of wide arm movements, she bends the lava up from underneath the landmass to sever it completely. As the wall of lava dies down again, chunks of rock fall to the ground. Kyoshi spins around and creates a powerful gale right beside Chin, blowing part of his army away and making the rest run away in fear. An overview shot shown how lava has seeped into the sea and how the island is being blown away from the mainland. Chin holds on to his hat as he watches the island go. He screams in anger while the rocks under him start to cave. An overview shot reveal how he plummets to his death in the waters below.\n",
      "The overview shot in the flashback fades for the present day overview shot of that same cliff where now a temple is build. \n",
      "KYOSHI: I created Kyoshi Island so my people could be safe from invaders. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She slants her eyes and is engulfed by the sand tornado once more. Tong kneels to the ground and covers his head. While the sandstorm keeps spinning around Kyoshi, the darkness is lifted. Sokka holds Katara protectively in his arms while she clings on to Momo. When the tornado disappears, Aang is standing there once again, swaying from side to side. Katara catches him right before he collapses. \n",
      "AANG: [Confused.] So, what just happened? \n",
      "KATARA: [Awkwardly.] Uhhh ... you kind of confessed. Sorry. \n",
      "TONG: [Standing up in the background.] And I find you ... [He brushes himself off and points at Aang.] Guilty! Bring out the Wheel of Punishment! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The villagers break out into cheers as they hear the sentence. Momo looks around, before covering up his eyes with his tail.\n",
      "Cut to Iroh who is bending over the supplies. \n",
      "ZUKO: Uncle ... [Switch to a close-up of Iroh with Zuko on the background.] I thought a lot about what you said. \n",
      "IROH: [Iroh's sad expression clears up as he hears Zuko talk.] You did? Good, good. \n",
      "ZUKO: It's helped me realize something. We no longer have anything to gain by traveling together. [Iroh's brightened expression quickly disappears again.] I need to find my own way. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Iroh bows his head in sorrow. Zuko looks at his uncle for a moment before grabbing his backpack and walking away. The camera zooms in on Iroh's face. \n",
      "IROH: [Calling after Zuko.] Wait! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Iroh hands Zuko the reins of the ostrich horse. Zuko mounts it, looks at his uncle one last time and heads off, leaving a broken Iroh.\n",
      "Switch back to a panning down shot of Chin Village where Aang stands before the Wheel of Punishment. \n",
      "GUARD: [Deep, monotonous voice.] The accused will now spin the Wheel of Punishment to determine his sentence. \n",

      "AANG: I said I would face justice, so I will. \n",

      "GUARD: [Monotone.] Looks like it's \"boiled in oil.\" \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The villagers cheer loudly, while Aang looks scared and Katara and Sokka who are just absolutely shocked.\n",
      "Suddenly a lit bomb bounces into the scene and detonates into the temple. The blast makes the whole amphitheater shake. Sokka and Katara raise their arms to protect their faces from the blast.\n",

      "MONGKE: We've come to claim this village for the Fire Lord! [Close-up.] Now show me your leader so I may ... [Kahchi swings his Guan Dao back and forth, slicing through the statue of Chin the Great. While it crumbles down, Mongke continues with a grin.] dethrone him! \n",
      "VILLAGER: That's him over there! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A scared villager points immediately toward the mayor. The mayor squeals and hides behind the Wheel of Punishment. \n",
      "TONG: Ahhh! [Commanding.] You, Avatar, do something! \n",
      "AANG: [Apathetically.] Gee, I'd love to help, but I'm supposed to be boiled in oil. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The mayor tips the wheel one slot further. It now rests on a picture of a sweeping man. \n",
      "TONG: There, community service! Now serve our community and get rid of those rhinos! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang smiles as he rushes forward and jumps out of his Kyoshi costume to face Kahchi, who readies his weapon. A he charges Aang, Aang opens his fans. He quickly spins out of the rhino's path and uses his airbending to lift Kahchi out of his saddle and blows him off the cliff with another gust.\n",
      "Kahchi's rhino still proceeds toward the mayor, who peeping over the wheel and quickly hides behind it as he sees the rhino coming toward him. He squeaks in fear when the rhino's horns embedded themselves into the wheel, missing the mayor's vital part by inches.\n",
      "Aang turns to face Mongke who does not look pleased with the defeat of Kahchi. \n",
      "MONGKE: [Raising his hand while shouting his command.] Rough Rhinos, to the town! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Vachir shoots three burning arrows at the down setting fire to the roof of a nearby building. Mongke uses his firebending to burn down another house. Lit arrows keep raining down on the rooftops. Close-up of Yeh-Lu as he rides by a hay wagon and drops some lit bombs in it. The wagon explodes, destroying the house next to it. Ogodei rides past another house and pulls down its support beams with his chains.\n",
      "Close-up as he lets out a loud scream and spins his chains above his head. He throws them at Katara who easily deflects them with a water whip. The chains wind themselves around Ogodei. She hits the rhino on the rear with another whip of her water and the animal dashes away with Ogodei on it.\n",
      "Sokka comes down a stair between two members of the Rough Rhinos. He adjusts his monocle so it would reflect the sunlight right into the eyes of Vachir. The archer turns and blindly shoots a burning arrow at Sokka. The arrow pierces his hat and embeds itself in the saddlebag of Yeh-Lu that is filled with bombs. Sokka smiles and ducks for cover. Yeh-Lu notices what is going on and tosses the saddlebag away, but it is too late. The force of the blast smacks him and his rhino into a nearby wall. As Sokka covers his head to protect himself against the flying debris, Yeh-Lu's helmet rolls by. Another bag lands right beside Sokka, his boomerang is sticking out of it. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Raises his arms in the air and exclaims ecstatically.] Boomerang! You do always come back! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka notices that Vachir is aiming at him. He quickly weighs his options and throws his dragon-shaped pipe at the archer. The pipe slides over the burning arrow and extinguishes the fire. While Vachir looks surprised at his extinguished arrow, Katara sneaks up behind him and cuts his saddle cord with her waterbending. Vachir slides down, but his foot is still stuck in his saddle, so he is dragged away by his rhino when Katara whips it on its rear.\n",
      "Switch to Aang who is having a standoff with Mongke in an alley. Mongke uses his firebending to increase his speed as he charges Aang. Aang jumps over him and is forced to raise an air shield to protect himself from Mongke's fire blast. He loses his fans and headdress as he slides down. Aang creates an air scooter and they charge each other again. He avoids Mongke's fire blast by quickly riding under the rhino's belly and emerges behind Mongke. He directs a powerful gale at the colonel, but he slides to the side to evade it. They charge at each other a third time, this time with Aang on foot again. When Mongke fires a powerful blast that consumes the whole alley, Aang jumps up and propels himself right through the blast using airbending, feet first. He crashes right into Mongke, sending him flying through a wooden fence.\n",
      "Cut to a scene of fireworks. Later that night, fireworks go off in the village. \n",

      "KATARA: Happy Avatar Day, everyone! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Uncertainly, she chews it down. She looks down at her bowl, confused of what to make of it. The camera pans to the right to show how Aang also sticks a cookie in his mouth, although half of it is still dangling out of his mouth. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Stares skeptically at his dough-cookie.] This is by far the worst town we've ever been to. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fades to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera pans across a wide-view over Gaoling. Town citizens move through the streets. The team stands inside a shop. The camera zooms in on them, gathered around a green bag. Sokka is looking at the bag while pondering. Katara and Momo on her shoulder look at him. Aang sits down, looking the other way and wearing his conical hat. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Pensively.] It's pricey ... but I really do like it. \n",

Aang looks perplexed, wearing an Earth Kingdom outfit and a green hat. He puts his finger into his ear, wiggles it and sniffs his finger. Turning to his right, he sees that all the younger children with whom he is standing in line with sport a serious expression and he promptly straightens his back. Their teacher, Master Yu, moves toward his two opposing rows of pupils. The row opposite of Aang has rocks placed in front of them. \n",
      "YU: Take your stances! [His students take their fighting stances, except for Aang.] Now, strike as if you're punching through your opponent's head! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Yu demonstrates the movement he means. The pupils lift their rocks. A close-up shows Aang's startled expression. The camera shifts to a close-up of the student that stands across Aang as he fires his rock at him. Aang gets hit by the rock in the gut and smashes into a vase in the shape of a tea pot by the impact of the blow. \n",
      "YU: [Approaches Aang.] So, are you ready to commit to more lessons? If you pay for the whole year in advance, I'll bump you up to the next belt! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang stares at him, covered in sand and shards. Only his eyes, nose and right hand are visible. The sand shifts and covers his face completely. Moments later, Aang walks out of the academy with the other students and returns to Katara and Sokka. \n",
      "AANG: Ehhh, he's not the one. [Beats his right ear, causing sand to fall out of his left ear.] \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A scene shows the two students frozen together at the head, encased in ice in an alley. Nightfall. The camera shows the entrance to location of Earth Rumble VI: a lighted tunnel in a rock face. People enter the tunnel. The camera shows the hall where the competition will be held. A large rectangular arena is located in the middle. The arena has stairs running down to a lower, oval shaped area. Seats for the spectators start at the same level as the arena. Team Avatar walks into an empty row of seats. \n",
      "AANG: Hey, front row seats! I wonder why no one else is sitting here. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They sit down but quickly jump back up as a huge rock smashes into the seats next to them. \n",
      "SOKKA: I guess that's why. \n",

      "XIN.FU: [Raises his left arm.] Welcome to Earth Rumble VI! I am your host, Xin Fu! \n",
      "KATARA: [Sighs and looks the other way.] This is just going to be a bunch of guys chucking rocks at each other, isn't it? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Happily.] That's what I paid for. \n",
      "XIN.FU: The rules are simple. Just knock the other guy out of the ring, and you win! [Leaps up to a podium above the ring. A bell rings.] Round one: The Boulder vs. The Big Bad Hippo!

      "THE.HIPPO: Hippo ... mad! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Hippo raises his arms in anger and stomps one foot. Momo lowers himself more inside Sokka's bag out of fear. The Boulder fires three rocks. They crash into The Hippo, but he does not move. He catches one piece of rock with his mouth, chews on it and spits it out. The Hippo jumps up and down, causing the surface of the arena to tilt. The Boulder hereby loses his balance. \n",
      "XIN.FU: Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen! The Hippo is rocking the boat! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Boulder reaches the edge, but saves himself by bending out part of the ring into a small platform. He grabs it and throws it at his opponent, hitting him on the back. As The Hippo turns around to look at him, The Boulder bends up The Hippo's part of the ring, and throws him out on it. The Hippo crashes in the lower area of around the arena. The fight ends thus in his favor. \n",
      "XIN.FU: The Boulder wins! \n",
      "KATARA: [Looking at The Boulder.] How about The Boulder? He's got some good moves. \n",
      "AANG: [Shrugs.] I don't know. Bumi said I need a teacher who listens to the earth. He's just listening to his big muscles. What do you think, Sokka? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka cheers loudly. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As Xin Fu was speaking, the girl raises her championship belt above her head, under loud cheering of the crowd. Cut to a further off frontal shot, showing the girl to actually be a short child, barely reaching to the waists of the female assistants standing next to her. As the spotlight dies down, the girl offers her championship belt to the assistant on her right, while the other one removes her cape, and they both walk off. The camera shifts to Aang and Katara. \n",
      "KATARA: She can't really be blind. [Turn her head and squints her eyes skeptically.] It's just part of her [Cut to a close-up of the Bandit's milky-green eyes; pans right.] character, right? \n",

Cut back to a frontal shot of the Bandit who has begun to swing her right foot in an arc toward the ground in font of her. As she strikes the ground, the view cuts to a wide shot from behind and above on her right. The frame rate speeds up to normal. Her strike creates a shock wave in the arena floor that churns up the ground in the direction of the Boulder in a straight line.\n",
      "A quick shot of Aang staring incredulously at the camera, his face turning to follow the Bandit's shock wave. Cut back to a frontal shot of The Boulder whose foot meets the shock wave just as he puts it back on the ground. The shock wave makes him drop down onto the ground in a perfect split. Cut briefly to Momo and Sokka. Momo squeaks and Sokka's look of adulation and excitement turns to a look of pain. Cut to a close shot from above The Boulder.

      "MALE.STUDENT.#2: [Holds hand up defensively.] No, no, I-I swear it's true. No one knows where she goes, or who she really is. \n",
      "AANG: That's because we're asking about the wrong person. In my vision, I saw a girl, in a white dress, with a pet flying boar. Know anybody like that? \n",
      "MALE.STUDENT: Well, a flying boar is the symbol of the Beifong family. They're the richest people in town. Probably the whole world. \n",

      "THE.BOULDER: I'm telling you, The Boulder was standing right there. I saw the kid strike, but there was no earthbending. Nothing made contact. The Blind Bandit just fell out of the ring. She must've took a dive and split the money with the kid. \n",

      "AANG: Well, a crazy king told me I had to find an earthbender who listens to the earth. And then I had a vision in a magic swamp, [Toph raises her eye in disbelief.] and - \n",
      "KATARA: [Cutting off Aang.] What Aang is trying to say is, he's the Avatar. And if he doesn't master earthbending soon, he won't be able to defeat the Fire Lord. \n",

      "SERVANT: Excuse me, sir, but you have a visitor. \n",
      "LAO: Who thinks they are so important they can just come to my home unannounced? \n",

      "AANG: I'd like to defeat the Fire Lord by the end of summer, but I can't do that without finding an earthbending teacher first. [Close-up of Toph with a annoyed look.] \n",
      "LAO: [Chuckles.] Well, Master Yu is the finest teacher in the land. [The camera pans to Yu.] He's been teaching Toph since she was little. \n",
      "AANG: Then she must be a great earthbender! Probably good enough to teach someone else! [Toph sends a fissure under the table at him.] Ow! \n",

      "YU: Toph is still learning the basics. \n",
      "LAO: Yes, and sadly, because of her blindness, I don't think she will ever become a true master. \n",
      "AANG: Oh, I'm sure she's better than you think she is. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph sends another fissure at him, causing his face to fall into the soup. Everybody stops eating. Aang rubs some soup out of his eyes and sneezes on purpose, sending the food flying at the Beifong family. \n",

Toph walks along the side of a bridge.] Even though I was born blind, I've never had a problem seeing. [Jumps down.] I see with earthbending. It's kind of like seeing with my feet. I feel the vibrations in the Earth, and I can see where everything is. [The camera shows an aerial view.] You, that tree ... [Cut back to the ground.] even those ants. \n",
      "AANG: [Looks around.] That's amazing. \n",
      "TOPH: My parents don't understand. They've always treated me like I was helpless. \n",
      "AANG: Is that why you became the Blind Bandit? \n",
      "TOPH: Yeah. \n",
      "AANG: Then why stay here where you're not happy? \n",
      "TOPH: They're my parents. Where else am I supposed to go? \n",
      "AANG: You could come with us. \n",
      "TOPH: Yeah. You guys get to go wherever you want. No one telling you what to do, that's the life. It's just not my life. [She detects something and touches the ground.] We're being ambushed! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They try to run, but get cut off by underground digging from The Gopher. They are imprisoned in metal cages. The Hippo jumps onto the two cages and starts stomping. The rest of the Earth Rumble wrestlers jump down onto the ground. \n",

      "SOKKA: Whoever took Aang and Toph left this. [Hands the note to Katara.] \n",
      "KATARA: \"If you want to see your daughter again, bring five hundred gold pieces to the arena.\" It's signed Xin Fu and The Boulder. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Serious.] I can't believe it ... [Grabs the note much to Katara's surprise and runs off a few feet. Cut to a further off shot; enthusiastically.] I have The Boulder's autograph! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka dramatically sinks to his knees and holds the scroll above his head. Cut to a close-up of Katara, who stares at him in annoyance. Behind her, Poppy wipes the tears out of her eyes and leave her husband's embrace, exciting the screen. \n",

      "TOPH: You think you're so tough? [The camera zooms back to show her case and Aang's suspended from chains. She points somewhere below her.] Why don't you come up here so I can snap that grin off your face? [Cut to Xin Fu and The Boulder looking from below them on the floor of the arena.] \n",
      "XIN.FU: [Narrows his eyes. Dryly.] I'm not smiling. \n",

      "XIN.FU: [Showing the Fire Nation wanted poster.] I think the Fire Nation will pay a hefty price for the Avatar. Now, get out of my ring. \n",

      "AANG: Go, I'll be okay. \n",
      "KATARA: Toph, there's too many of them. We need an earthbender. We need you! \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Water Tribe siblings watch in surprise. She shakes the ring up, shooting back the oncoming wrestlers. She enters the resulting dust crowd, unnerving Lao.\n",
      "Toph creates a large cloud of dust, walks in, and encounters the Fire Nation Man, who takes some time to notice her. As he moves his foot to attack, she smirks. He fires an wave of earth at her, which she dodges. She bends up part of the ring and sends her own wave, ejecting him from the ring as he slams against the sidelines and lands on the ground. Lao and Yu watch from the sidelines in shock.\n",
      "Katara and Sokka try to release Aang. Sokka repeatedly bangs a rock against the cage. \n",
      "AANG: Hit it harder! \n",
      "SOKKA: I'm trying! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Gecko crawls along the floor and becomes aware of Toph's presence. He fires two rocks which she easily dodges. She bends up a series of pillars, sending him flying out of the ring. Cut to a disoriented Fire Nation Man who slowly gets up before he realizes the Gecko heading to him and he crashes into him.

However, Toph hears him and turns the center of the ring around to put Headhunter on a collision course with the other two wrestlers.

A quick shot of her father, who looks shocked at her lack of manners, and Yu. and gets into a fighting stance and they circle the central ring. Xin Fu fires several rocks at her. She brings up an earth shield, deflecting them all. She turns part of the shield on him. He dodges one piece, but when he hits the ring again, Toph picks up his vibrations in it and senses an attack. She dodges a rock and creates a fissure, sending him flying out of the ring between Yu and Lao. Sokka collapses in shock at the sight. Aang and Katara are left amazed and run toward her. Cut back to Yu and Lao. \n",
      "YU: She's the greatest earthbender I've ever seen. \n",

      "TOPH: Dad, I know it's probably hard for you to see me this way. But the obedient little helpless blind girl that you think I am just isn't me. I love fighting. I love being an earthbender, and I'm really, really good at it. I know I've kept my life secret from you, but you were keeping me secret from the whole world. You were doing it to protect me, but I'm twelve years old and I've never had a real friend. So, now that you see who I really am, I hope it doesn't change the way you feel about me. \n",
      "LAO: Of course it doesn't change the way I feel about you, Toph. It's made me realize something. \n",
      "TOPH: It has? \n",
      "LAO: Yes. I've let you had far too much freedom. From now on you'll be cared for and guarded twenty-four hours a day. \n",
      "TOPH: But, Dad! \n",

      "AANG: Toph! What are you doing here? \n",
      "TOPH: My dad changed his mind. He said I was free to travel the world. [Katara and Sokka look at each other with unsure looks, but smile at Toph.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Well, we'd better get out of here, before your dad changes his mind again. \n",
      "TOPH: Good idea. \n",
      "AANG: You're going to be a great teacher, Toph. \n",
      "TOPH: Speaking of which, I want to show you something. \n",
      "AANG: Okay. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang jumps down from Appa and she bends up a rock, sending him into the air and landing in a tree. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka tosses the belt down, hitting Toph on the head with a sound effect and knocking her down. \n",
      "TOPH: Ow! [Cut to a wide shot Appa and Toph still laid out flat.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Sorry. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang falls down from the tree in the background. Back at the Beifong estate, Lao meets with Yu and Xin Fu. \n",
      "LAO: I know you two are very different. But I believe you have a common interest. [A servant brings out a chest of gold. Xin Fu and Yu exchange glances at one another.] The Avatar has kidnapped my daughter. I want you to do whatever it takes to bring her home. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Yu and Xin Fu bow in agreement. A final scene shows Toph, now content, as they all fly off on Appa. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode begins with Zuko by himself, riding his stolen ostrich horse through a fairly barren landscape. After walking for a bit, they arrive at a decrepit bridge over a ravine that breaks as they cross. After regaining control, they continue crossing. A little while later, Zuko smells food and spots a steak being cooked by a couple below the ridge he is walking on. He holds his stomach in hunger, and reaches for his dual dao swords, preparing himself to steal from them. However, after noticing that the woman is pregnant, he stops himself and continues on his way.\n",
      "Riding through grasslands covered in large broken Earth Kingdom rocks, Zuko holds his water pouch to his lips for a drink, only to finish it off thirstily. Exhausted from his travels, his sight becoming blurry and his eyes closing slowly as he struggles to maintain consciousness. He shakes himself awake, only to close his eyes again moments later. He has a flashback of a beautiful, middle-aged woman in a cloak turning and walking away in a dark hallway. He opens his eyes but keeps his head down.\n",
      "Under the hot sun, Zuko reaches a small, poor town where the buildings are mostly made of wood and seem to be poorly constructed. We come upon four men dressed in green, gambling. \n",
      "EARTH.KINGDOM.SOLDIER: Come on, spider snake-eyes! [He rolls a pair of dice and they land with two fives, face-up.] Ha! Ha! Yeah! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Two of the other men turn around and punch him in the stomach once each. He grunts with each punch.\n",
      "Zuko rides through town and passes the soldiers. Their leader, Gow, glares at him and Zuko glares back. Zuko stops, gets off of his ostrich horse and turns to a merchant at a store. \n",
      "ZUKO: Could I get some water, a bag of feed and something hot to eat? [Zuko holds out his hand. In it are two coins.] \n",
      "STORE.OWNER: Not enough here for a hot meal. I can get you two bags of feed. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko looks down, disappointed. He notices that the four Earth Kingdom men are watching him.\n",
      "Two children hide behind the store counter, looking amused. One of them giggles and throws an egg. It hits a gambling soldier. \n",
      "EARTH.KINGDOM.SOLDIER: Ow! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two boys run off as the Earth Kingdom soldier turn around, looking angry. They only see Zuko behind them, so they stand up indignantly. \n",
      "GOW: Hey! You throwing eggs at us, stranger? \n",
      "ZUKO: No. \n",
      "GOW: You see who did throw it? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Turns to face them.] No. \n",
      "EARTH.KINGDOM.SOLDIER: That your favorite word, no? \n",
      "GOW: Egg had to come from somewhere. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Turns around.] Maybe a chicken flew over. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Earth Kingdom soldier laughs, and Gow glares at him. At that moment, the store owner returns with Zuko's feed bags for the ostrich horse. Gow goes to the counter and grabs both bags before he can take them. \n",
      "GOW: Thanks for your contribution. The army appreciates your support. [He throws the bags to one of his fellow soldiers.] You better leave town. Penalty for stayin's a lot steeper than you can afford, stranger. Trust me. [He pats his hammer at his side menacingly.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The soldiers turn and leave with the bags. \n",
      "STORE.OWNER: Those soldiers are supposed to protect us from the Fire Nation. But they're just a bunch of thugs. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko walks toward his ostrich horse. As he is about to re-mount, one of the little boys from earlier pops up from behind the animal. \n",
      "LEE: Thanks for not ratting me out! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko ignores the boy, gets on his steed and starts riding away. Lee casts him an annoyed look before brightening. Lee comes up from behind and grabs the reins. \n",
      "LEE: I'll take you to my house and feed your ostrich horse for you. Come on, I owe you! [Lee leads the way, pulling along the animal.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A shot of Zuko holding his stomach in hunger fades to a pig farm, Zuko and Lee arrive on a dirt road at the farm among mountains in the countryside. A little wooden farmhouse with a roof that needs re-shingling. Several different types of hybrid pigs spotted in enclosures. \n",
      "LEE: No one can ever sneak up on us. \n",
      "ZUKO: No kidding. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Lee takes the ostrich horse away. Zuko casts his glance off to the side; the camera shifts to show a pig rooster, who crows at him. A man approaches Zuko. A woman peers out from behind the farmhouse. \n",
      "GANSU: You a friend of Lee's? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Lee comes running out of the barn excitedly and grabs his father's arm. \n",
      "LEE: This guy just stood up to the soldiers! By the end, he practically had them running away! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The woman from earlier comes forward to join her husband and son, wiping her hands on a rag. \n",
      "SELA: Does this guy have a name? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Nervously.] I'm ... uh ... \n",
      "GANSU: [Off-camera.] He doesn't have to say who he is if he doesn't want to, Sela. [Cuts to shot of him standing with his family.] Anyone who can hold his own against those bully soldiers is welcome here. Those men should be ashamed to wear Earth Kingdom uniforms. \n",
      "SELA: The real soldiers are off fighting the War, [Cuts to shot of Lee.] like Lee's big brother Sensu. [Pause.] Supper's going to be ready soon. Would you like to stay? \n",
      "ZUKO: I can't. I should be moving on. [The wife frowns and casts a glance at her husband.] \n",
      "SELA: Gansu could use some help on the barn. Why don't you two work for a while, and then we'll eat. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko nods in agreement. The camera fades to Zuko and Gansu working on the roof of the barn. Lee is resting on a ladder, watching them re-shingle the roof. While Gansu is doing well and working steadily, Zuko has several twisted and broken nails in front of him, although it is evident he is trying hard to do a good job. \n",
      "LEE: You don't seem like you're from around here. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Shaking his head.] Mm-mm. \n",
      "LEE: Where are you from then? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Lowers his hammer.] Far away. \n",
      "LEE: Ohhh. Where are you going? \n",
      "GANSU: Lee, give it a rest. Stop asking the man personal questions, got it? \n",
      "LEE: [Disappointed and rests his head on his arm. He sighs.] Yes. [Pause.] So how'd you get that scar? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko is surprised at the question and swings down his hammer a little too hard. He strikes his thumb, now red, and groans in pain. \n",
      "GANSU: It's not nice to bother people about things they might not want to talk about. A man's past is his business. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Gansu goes back to hammering and so does Zuko. The scene fades away to the sound of hammers hitting metal as Zuko starts reminiscing about the past.\n",
      "Fade to a shot of the water's surface. An unknown person places a fingertip in the water and holds their hand out to reveal bread crumbs. Cuts to shot of the Royal Gardens, two figures sitting by the edge of a large kidney-shaped pond. Cuts to shot of a younger Zuko and his mother, who are feeding some bread to four turtle ducks – a mother and her four babies. \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: Hey Mom, want to see how Azula feeds turtle ducks? [Zuko throws the rest of the loaf of bread into the water and hits one of the baby turtle ducks. Ursa is shocked.] \n",
      "URSA: Zuko! Why would you do that? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: After the baby turtle duck surfaces again, the mother turtle duck charges forth and bites Zuko's ankle hard. \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: Ow! Ow ow! Ouch! [Ursa removes the turtle duck from Zuko and gently throws her back into the pond, where she swims off with her babies. Zuko is pouting.] \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: Stupid turtle duck. Why she'd do that? \n",
      "URSA: Zuko. That's what moms are like. [Puts her arm around Zuko.] If you mess with their babies,[She playfully bites behind Zuko's ear.], they're gonna bite you back! [They laugh.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A little while later, young Azula, Ty Lee and Mai are playing together in the royal yard by a man-made river and a rather large fountain. While Mai sits and watches under the shade of a tree, Azula does a complicated flip but messes up the ending and grunts. Ty Lee does the same flip, only she completes the ending perfectly and lands on her feet, arms proudly up in the air. Azula pushes her over and laughs. \n",
      "YOUNG.TY.LEE: Ugh! Azula! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko and Ursa walk by together nearby. Mai sees them, smiles, turns away and blushes. Azula notices her obvious crush, however, and turns to Ty Lee with a plot in mind. \n",
      "YOUNG.AZULA: [Whispering in Ty Lee's ear as her friend giggles.] Watch this! [Runs toward her mother and Zuko.] Mom! Can you make Zuko play with us? We need equal teams to play a game! \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: I am not cart-wheeling. \n",
      "YOUNG.AZULA: You won't have to. [Rolls her eyes.] Cart-wheeling's not a game, dum-dum. \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: I don't care. I don't want to play with you! \n",
      "YOUNG.AZULA: We are brother and sister. It's important for us to spend time together! Don't you think so, Mom? [Shoots her mother an innocent smile.] \n",
      "URSA: [Places her hands on Zuko's shoulder.] Yes, darling, I think it's a good idea to play with your sister. [Ruffles his hair.] Go on now, just for a little while. [Walks away, with Zuko glaring at his sister.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Azula reaches for an apple on the tree that Mai was under earlier. Mai, now standing in front of the fountain, is still while Azula places the apple on her head. \n",
      "YOUNG.AZULA: [Off-camera.] Here's the way it goes. [After placing apple on Mai's head, she runs back several feet.] Now what you do is, try to knock the apple off the other person's head, like this. [Azula shots a small jet of flame to the apple with her firebending and knowingly sets it on fire.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko is shocked and runs forward toward Mai, who screams as Zuko approaches her. He slams into her and the both of them fall into the fountain, with Zuko lying on top of Mai's stomach. Both seem very shocked and embarrassed. Azula starts laughing at them. \n",
      "YOUNG.AZULA: [Lays a hand on Ty Lee's shoulder.] See, I told you it would work! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of Azula and Ty Lee observing Zuko and Mai in the fountain, their backs facing the camera. \n",
      "YOUNG.TY.LEE: Aww, they're so cute together! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko gets up angrily and leaves the fountain. Mai stands up as well. \n",
      "YOUNG.MAI: You two are such ... ugh! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: At that moment, Ursa comes from the house toward the children, a scroll of paper in her hand. \n",
      "URSA: I was just coming to get you. Uncle Iroh sent us a letter from the war-front. [Zuko stomps past her, leaving small puddles behind him as he goes.] You're soaking wet? \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: [Raises hands in frustration.] Girls are crazy! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene switches to the letter and what is occurring with Iroh. Rubble surround a large gap in the wall of Ba Sing Se with smoke emitting from everywhere. A tent is set up nearby, with a younger General Iroh writing at a desk. \n",
      "IROH: [Voice-over.] If the city is as magnificent as its wall, Ba Sing Se must be something to behold. I hope you all may see it someday, if we don't burn it to the ground first! [Laughs.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Switch back to Ursa, Zuko and Azula. The children are laughing at the joke as well. Ursa continues down the letter. \n",
      "URSA: Until then, enjoy these gifts. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Two servants dressed in white come up, and Zuko runs to meet them. Ursa sits there and continues reading. \n",
      "URSA: For Zuko, a pearl dagger from the general who surrendered when we broke through the Outer Wall. Note the inscription and the superior craftsmanship. \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: [Zuko picks up the dagger admiringly, unsheathes it and reads the inscription.] Never give up without a fight. \n",
      "URSA: And for Azula, a new friend. She wears the latest fashion for Earth Kingdom girls. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As Ursa reads, Azula picks up her present. It is a doll wearing green. She picks it up by the head with disgust, making sounds and sticking out her tongue. \n",
      "YOUNG.AZULA: If Uncle doesn't make it back from war, then Dad will be next in line for Fire Lord, wouldn't he? \n",
      "URSA: Azula, we don't speak that way. It would be awful if Uncle Iroh didn't return. And besides, Fire Lord Azulon is a picture of health. \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: How would you like it if cousin Lu Ten wanted Dad to die? \n",
      "YOUNG.AZULA: I still think our dad would make a much better Fire Lord than His Royal Tea-Loving Kookiness. [Sets the doll's head on fire.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Flashback ends. Night has fallen, and Zuko is sleeping on a pile of hay inside the barn. A door opens and Lee comes sneaking in. He takes the Dual Dao swords, but nearly stops when Zuko makes a sound in his sleep. Nevertheless, Lee walks out of the barn with the swords and closes the squeaky door. Zuko's eyes pop open as if he was only feigning sleep the whole time. Cut to a large sunflower garden, where Lee is practicing with the swords. He jumps around and chops off several sunflower heads. He starts stabbing a nearby dead tree trunk repeatedly, his tongue lolling out of his mouth and breathes heavily in effort as Zuko silently approaches behind him. \n",
      "ZUKO: You're holding them wrong. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Lee falls backward in surprise. The shot shows Zuko, arms crossed, standing a little further back in the patch of sunflowers. Lee gets back up, ashamed, and holds out the swords to Zuko. He takes them. \n",
      "ZUKO: Keep in mind, these are dual swords. Two halves of a single weapon. Don't think of them as separate, 'cause they're not. They're just two different parts of the same whole. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko swings around the swords carefully, demonstrating his skill. He cuts off some sunflower heads, turns around, and hands the swords back to Lee to try. Lee is a little more careful this time, and a little less awkward with the swords. He turns to Zuko once he is done his mini demonstration. Zuko smiles kindly; Lee smiles back and laughs. They begin walking away from the sunflower patch together, side by side under the full moon. \n",
      "LEE: I think you'd really like my brother Sensu. He used to show me stuff like this all the time. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to the morning at the pig farm. Zuko mounts his ostrich horse again, ready to leave the hospitable family. Gansu, Sela and Lee have all come to see Zuko off. \n",
      "SELA: [Reaches up and offers Zuko a package.] Here. This ought to get you through a few meals. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko is just about to grab the package when he looks up and notices a cloud of dust in the distance. It is Gow and his cronies riding in on ostrich horses. Gansu steps forward. \n",
      "GANSU: What do you think they want? \n",
      "ZUKO: Trouble. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Gow and his crew ride toward the pig farm. The animals squeal, clearly irritated at their arrival. The Earth Kingdom soldiers stop right in front of Gansu's family and Zuko. \n",
      "GANSU: What do you want, Gow? \n",
      "GOW: Just thought someone ought to tell you that your son's battalion got captured. [To his fellow soldiers.] You boys hear what the Fire Nation did with their last group of Earth Kingdom prisoners? \n",
      "EARTH.KINGDOM.SOLDIER: Dressed 'em up in Fire Nation uniforms and put 'em on the front line unarmed, the way I heard it. [Spits on the ground.] Then they just watched. \n",
      "GANSU: [Angrily.] You watch your mouth! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Gow rides forward a little more toward Gansu when Zuko goes in between them, interfering. Gow and Zuko glare at each other. \n",
      "GOW: Why bother rooting around in the mud with these pigs? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Gow turns around his ostrich horse and all four soldiers ride away, kicking up a cloud of dust behind them. Cut to another one of Zuko's flashbacks in the palace grounds again and to the fountain seen earlier. Zuko and Azula are happily playing together while Ursa sits in front of the fountain when a messenger in white approaches her with a scroll. She opens and reads it before standing up and crying. She turns to young Zuko and Azula. \n",
      "URSA: Iroh has lost his son. Your cousin Lu Ten did not survive the battle. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko seems shocked and sad at the news, while Azula does not seem to react at all. Cut back to the present, where Zuko is still in front of the family protectively. Sela and Gansu are hugging behind him; Lee is standing close by. \n",
      "LEE: What's going to happen to my brother? \n",
      "GANSU: I'm going to the front. I'm going to find Sensu and bring him back. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sela and Gansu walk away from Zuko, with Sela crying desperately. Lee runs toward Zuko. \n",
      "LEE: When my dad goes ... will you stay? \n",
      "ZUKO: No. I need to move on. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko reaches behind him and takes out a sheathed dagger. He bends down and gives it to Lee, who takes it with a faint smile. \n",
      "ZUKO: Here. I want you to have this. Read the inscription. \n",
      "LEE: [Unsheathes the dagger.] Made in Earth Kingdom. \n",
      "ZUKO: The other one. \n",
      "LEE: Never give up without a fight. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: With that, Zuko rides away from Lee. Lee runs after him for a little bit, but stops shortly afterward. Cut to Zuko's memory again; this time he is in the Royal Palace playing with his dagger from Iroh (the one he just gave to Lee.) He fakes his death, dramatically falling to the floor with a groan. Azula sits cross-legged behind him. \n",
      "YOUNG.AZULA: You waste all your time playing with knives. You're not even good! \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: Put an apple on your head and we'll find out how good I am! \n",
      "YOUNG.AZULA: By the way, Uncle's coming home. \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: Does that mean ... we won the War? \n",
      "YOUNG.AZULA: No, it means Uncle's a quitter and a loser. \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: What are you talking about? Uncle's not a quitter! \n",
      "YOUNG.AZULA: Oh yes he is! He found out his son died and he just fell apart! A real general would stay and burn Ba Sing Se to the ground, not lose the battle and come home crying. \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: How do you know what he should do? He's probably just sad his only kid is gone. Forever. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: At that moment, Ursa appears in the doorway. \n",
      "URSA: Your father has requested an audience with Fire Lord Azulon. Best clothes, hurry up! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko runs past Ursa quickly to get ready, while Azula walks rather slowly. \n",
      "YOUNG.AZULA: [In a bored tone.] Fire Lord Azulon ... can't you just call him 'Grandfather'? He's not exactly the powerful Fire Lord he used to be. Someone will probably end up taking his place soon. \n",
      "URSA: [Angrily.] Young lady! Not another word! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Azula runs past her mother and leaves. \n",
      "URSA: What is wrong with that child? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to the Fire Lord's chamber, a large room with many columns and a wall of fire in front of the Fire Lord's throne. Ozai, Ursa, Zuko, and Azula are all sitting on the floor some distance back from Fire Lord Azulon, though Ozai's face remains obscured save for his mouth. \n",
      "OZAI: And how was it Great-Grandfather Sozin managed to win the Battle of Han Tui? \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: [Confusedly.] Great-Grandfather won ... because ... \n",
      "YOUNG.AZULA: Because even though his army was outnumbered, he cleverly calculated his advantages. The enemy was downwind and there was a drought. Their defenses burned to a crisp in minutes. \n",
      "OZAI: Correct, my dear. Now, would you show Grandfather the new moves you demonstrated to me? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Azula stands up and moves forward. She begins with some circular motions, warms herself up, and firebends. Ozai smiles. Azula does many fairly complicated moves with ease, and Zuko watches her in amazement. She finishes off her routine with a jump and a powerful fire blast toward the throne, before landing on her feet gracefully. \n",
      "OZAI: She's a true prodigy! Just like her grandfather for whom she's named. \n",
      "YOUNG.AZULA: [Sits back down, and looks at Zuko out of the corner of her eye and whispers.] You'll never catch up ... \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: [Stands up angrily.] I'd like to demonstrate what I've been learning. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Ozai frowns at this news. Zuko starts off well, doing the same circular motions as Azula earlier. He manages to produce a small fire blast, which does not impress Fire Lord Azulon. When he tries to create another one, he falls. He gets back up, panting heavily, and tries again, only to fall harder. Ursa gets up worriedly and approaches Zuko to comfort him. \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: I failed. \n",
      "URSA: No. I loved watching you. That's who you are, Zuko. Someone who keeps fighting even though it's hard. \n",
      "AZULON: Prince Ozai, why are you wasting my time with this pomp? Just tell me what you want. Everyone else, go! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Ursa, Zuko and Azula start walking out of the throne room; however, Azula pulls Zuko off to the side just before they exit. The children hide in the curtains at the back of the room. \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: What are you -? \n",
      "YOUNG.AZULA: Shh! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Azula and Zuko stop where the curtains open and peek back out at the throne room, exposing only their faces. \n",
      "OZAI: Father, you must have realized as I have, that with Lu Ten gone, Iroh's bloodline has ended. After his son's death, my brother abandoned the siege at Ba Sing Se, and who knows when he will return home. But I am here, Father, and my children are alive. \n",
      "AZULON: Say what it is you want! \n",
      "OZAI: Father, revoke Iroh's birthright. I am your humble servant, here to serve you and our nation. Use me. \n",
      "AZULON: You dare suggest I betray Iroh? My first born? Directly after the demise of his only beloved son? I think Iroh has suffered enough! But you ... your punishment has scarcely begun! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Azulon's anger causes the flames around him to grow. Zuko, scared, runs away from behind the curtain as Azula watches, but she stays and continues watching with an evil smile on her face.\n",
      "The scene switches to Zuko laying in a large bed in a large ornate room. He suddenly looks up, alarmed. Azula is standing in his doorway, arms crossed. She looks amused. \n",
      "YOUNG.AZULA: [Sing-songy.] Dad's going to kill you! [Seriously.] Really, he is. \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: Ha-ha, Azula. Nice try. \n",
      "YOUNG.AZULA: Fine, don't believe me. But I heard everything. Grandfather said Dad's punishment should fit his crime. [Imitates Azulon.] \"You must know the pain of losing a first-born son. By sacrificing your own!\" \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: Liar! \n",
      "YOUNG.AZULA: I'm only telling you for your own good. I know! Maybe you could find a nice Earth Kingdom family to adopt you! \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: Stop it! You're lying! Dad would never do that to me! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Ursa appears in the doorway of Zuko's room. \n",
      "URSA: Your father would never do what to you? What is going on here? \n",
      "YOUNG.AZULA: I don't know ... \n",
      "URSA: It's time for a talk! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Ursa drags Azula away from Zuko's bed, and Azula follows reluctantly. Zuko clasps the blanket tightly in his hands. \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: [Chanting in a low voice.] Azula always lies. Azula always lies. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the older Zuko, lying in green grass, holding his traveler's hat to his chest. \n",
      "ZUKO: Azula always lies. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: An ostrich horse can be heard. Zuko sits up and looks to see Sela riding toward him in a carriage. She is frantic and panicked. \n",
      "SELA: You have to help! It's Lee – the thugs from town came back as soon as Gansu left. When they ordered us to give them food, Lee pulled a knife on them! I don't even know where he got a knife! Then they took him away. [Begins to sob.] They told me if he's old enough to fight, he's old enough to join the army. I know we barely know you, but ... \n",
      "ZUKO: [Stands up dramatically.] I'll get your son back. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back in the Earth Kingdom town, it is sunset. Zuko is riding on his ostrich horse through a small archway that enters into the town. The people around scatter when they see him coming. Lee is tied up to a tower. He seems sad, but when he looks up to see Zuko. He quickly regains hope. \n",
      "LEE: Hey! There he is! I told you he'd come! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Earth Kingdom soldiers approach him, as does their leader, Gow. Zuko dismounts and takes off his hat, placing it on the ostrich horse. They face each other, battle imminent. \n",
      "ZUKO: Let the kid go. \n",
      "GOW: [Laughs loudly, but quickly regains composure.] Who do you think you are, telling us what to do? \n",
      "ZUKO: It doesn't matter who I am. But I know who you are. You're not soldiers; you're bullies. Freeloaders, abusing your power. Mostly over women and kids. You don't want Lee in your army – you're sick cowards messing with a family who's already lost one son to the war. \n",
      "GOW: [To a fellow soldier.] Are you gonna let this stranger stand there and insult you like this? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The soldier runs forward, spear in hand. He goes to attack Zuko, who pulls out his sword and punches the other man in the stomach with the hilt without fully unsheathing his sword. Zuko re-sheathes his sword while the man slides backward and runs away, panting heavily in fear.\n",
      "A second Earth Kingdom soldier groans and runs to attack Zuko with his spear this time. Zuko punches the spear upward to move it out of the way, grabs onto the man's forehead, and shoves him to the ground. The man gets up slowly and flees as well.\n",
      "A third Earth Kingdom soldier charges toward Zuko with his spear as well. Zuko stands there, waiting, until the spear is close enough and kicks the spear right in the middle, snapping it. The spearhead, along with half of the spear, goes flying in the other direction. The soldier gasps and runs away from Zuko like the two men before him. Lee laughs in satisfaction. A crowd has gathered; Sela's worried face is one of many.\n",
      "With the last of his cronies gone, Gow steps up to the plate to fight Zuko, dual hammers against dual swords. They draw their weapons, and Gow throws the first blow, a rock he has earthbent, and powerfully thrusts over to Zuko. Zuko deflects it readily with his swords. Gow strikes again, this time with three large rocks instead of one. He sends them over in rapid succession to Zuko, who deflects the first two easily. However, the third rock hits him in the stomach and he stumbles backward. This does not dismay him though, so he charges Gow. An old man in the crowd cheers him on. \n",
      "OLD.MAN: Give him a left! A left! \n",
      "OLD.WOMAN: It's not a fistfight ... \n",
      "OLD.MAN: He's got a left sword, don't he? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Gow does the same earthbending trick as earlier; he throws three large rocks at Zuko. Zuko responds the same as before, deflecting the first two but the third one hitting him square in the abdomen. However, this time, he falls over and somersaults backward, and manages to get up, although weakened and still stumbling around. Gow smiles. \n",
      "OLD.MAN: Look out! \n",
      "LEE: Behind you! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Gow earthbends again, but with increasingly larger rocks each time. He shoots four rocks at Zuko, who manages to destroy each, one by one. It continues this way, Gow no longer giving little recovery breaks to Zuko. Both are fighting at full force, although Zuko is so busy being defensive of the large flying rocks that he cannot become offensive to Gow. However, finally Gow creates a rockalanche and directs it at Zuko. The crowd gasps collectively. Zuko is sent flying and lands straight on his back, and has a sudden flashback.\n",
      "In the flashback, Zuko is sleeping in his room at night when a hand gently touches his shoulder. He awakens drowsily to see his mother dressed in a cloak. \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: ... Mom? \n",
      "URSA: Zuko, please, my love, listen to me. Everything I've done, I've done to protect you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She pulls the barely conscious Zuko into a hug. \n",
      "URSA: Remember this, Zuko. No matter how things may seem to change, never forget who you are. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She turns away from him with a sad smile, pulls her hood up and disappears down the dark hallway; it is the flashback Zuko had at the very beginning of the episode.\n",
      "The flashback ends as suddenly as it begin, and we cut back to Zuko in the Earth Kingdom village, lying on the ground. Gow is approaching him. \n",
      "LEE: [Whispers worriedly.] Get up ...! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Gow raises his hammers to deliver the final blow when Zuko's eyes open. He reaches for his swords and gets up firebending, creating a hurricane of flame. Gow drops his hammers and is pushed over, and lands on his back. Zuko stands there, seething at Gow. Although unarmed, Gow stands up and raises his fists, determined to finish the fight. Zuko charges him, sending various fire blasts. Gow tries to deflect them with earthbending, but the blasts are too powerful and he is sent backward again. Rocks hit his head as he lands in with a cloud of dust. \n",
      "GOW: Who ... who are you? \n",
      "ZUKO: My name is Zuko. Son of Ursa and Fire Lord Ozai. Prince of the Fire Nation, and heir to the throne. \n",
      "OLD.MAN: Liar! I heard of you! You're not a prince, you're an outcast! His own father burned and disowned him! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko kneels down toward Gow, who shudders in fear. However, Zuko does nothing to harm him; he only takes Lee's dagger back. Zuko walks toward Lee to give it back, but Sela (who had been untying Lee) intervenes. \n",
      "SELA: Not a step closer. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Zuko kneels down in front of Sela, with Lee peeking around his mother's back, offering the knife.] It's yours. You should have it. \n",
      "LEE: No! I hate you! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko has another flashback. It is probably early morning and he is in his bed in his room. He wakes with a start. \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: Mom? [Zuko leaps out of bed and runs out of his room down the hallway.] Mom? Mom! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko enters a pillared room, where Azula is admiring Zuko's dagger from behind a pillar. She re-sheathes it and steps out to face Zuko. \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: Where's Mom? \n",
      "YOUNG.AZULA: No one knows. Oh, and last night, Grandpa passed away. \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: Not funny, Azula! You're sick. And I want my knife back, now. [Zuko tries to grab it, but misses as Azula quickly moves out of the way, and loudly grunts.] \n",
      "YOUNG.AZULA: [Tauntingly.] Who's going to make me? Mom? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko dashes forward and grabs his knife from Azula, who was dangling in a tantalizing manner. He runs away to keep looking. Zuko reaches the garden where his father is standing still, staring into a pond. \n",
      "YOUNG.ZUKO: Where is she? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Ozai does not acknowledge that he has heard Zuko. Zuko bows his head.\n",
      "The scene switches to the palace from the outside on the stairs, outside at night. Row upon row of people standing on the palace grounds, wearing red hooded cloaks and carrying long, red, rectangular flags. At the top of the steps to the palace, a Fire Sage leader dressed in red, with several other Fire Sages in white behind him. There is an elaborate coffin behind him as well. Zuko, Azula, and Ozai are standing to his right. \n",
      "FIRE.SAGE: Azulon. Fire Lord to our nation for twenty-three years. You were our fearless leader in the Battle of Garsai. Our matchless conqueror of the Hu Xin Provinces. You were father of Iroh, father of Ozai, husband of Ilah, now passed. Grandfather of Lu Ten, now passed. Grandfather of Zuko, and Azula. We lay you to rest. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: With those words, two attendants in white firebend Azulon's coffin, which was on a layer of wood so it burns easily. The Fire Sage holds up the fire crown. \n",
      "FIRE.SAGE: As was your dying wish, you are now succeeded by your second son. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He places the fire crown in Ozai's top knot and steps away. \n",
      "FIRE.SAGE: Hail Fire Lord Ozai! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Ozai stands up, and the group of mourners wearing red and holding flags all kneel down at once, as do the Fire Sages behind him and Zuko and Azula. Azula is smiling wickedly at this new development. Zuko looks over at her and the crowd with absolute fear in his eyes. The flashback ends.\n",
      "Zuko rides out of the Earth Kingdom village on his stolen ostrich horse. The villagers stand in lines on either side of him with various possible weapons in their hands: a hoe, a pitchfork, a rock for throwing. They watch him leave with anger and hatred in their eyes. As Zuko passes Lee, the boy looks the other way. Zuko ignores them, and rides off into the sunset, just as alone as when he arrived. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to credits \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens to a forested area at sunset. The camera pans downward to show Team Avatar, now including Toph, preparing to set up the campsite. Aang hands Sokka a sleeping bag. Toph stands on the ground near Appa. \n",
      "TOPH: Hey! You guys picked a great campsite. [This directs everyone's attention to her. She wriggles her toes in the thick mat of fur covering the ground around the bison.] The grass is so soft. \n",
      "SOKKA: That's not grass. [Somewhat displeased.]  Appa's shedding. \n",
      "KATARA: [Displeased, raises foot warily.] Oh, gross! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to Aang sitting on Appa, a bluebird perched on his head and a yellow butterfly fluttering past. Momo jumps up in an attempt to catch the butterfly. \n",
      "AANG: [Cheerfully.] That's not gross, it's just a part of spring! You know, rebirth, flowers blooming and Appa gets a new coat. \n",
      "KATARA: [Sarcastically.] Ah, the beauty of spring. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa, who had currently been grooming himself, sneezes, releasing a thick cloud of fur. \n",
      "KATARA: [Waving arms about, now coated in fur.] Stop! Appa, stop! Ugh! [Coughs.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Bending over, his back turned to her.] It's not that bad, Katara. [He turns to reveal a wig made of fur, done up in a towering beehive.] It makes a great wig! \n",
      "AANG: [Wearing a beard of fur.] And a great beard! [Aang and Sokka laugh while pointing at each other.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Wiping fur off her clothing with her eyes closed.] I'm just glad we finally have another girl in the group, because you two are disgusting. \n",
      "TOPH: [Walking up from behind the two boys.] Excuse me, does anyone have a razor? Because I've got some hairy pits! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She raises her arms, revealing that she had stuffed fur in her sleeves. The three laugh; Aang sneezes, sending himself flying backward. The big sneeze causes him to crash against Appa's leg and for fur to blow off his friends and himself. The impact leaves some fur on his back. They continue to laugh joyfully, causing Katara to chuckle slightly. The scene cuts to later in the evening where the group is setting up camp. Aang sets up the tent while Sokka throws down a pile of firewood he collected. Katara, who spends her time stirring around water in a pot, notices Toph slumped lazily against a rock, chewing a piece of wheat. She approaches her. \n",
      "KATARA: So Toph, usually when setting up camp, we try to divide up the work. \n",
      "TOPH: [Shrugging casually.] Hey, don't worry about me. I'm good to go. \n",
      "KATARA: Well, actually what I'm trying to say is, [Holds arms out in gesture.] some of us might fetch water, while someone else might set up the fire pit, or put up the tent. [Momo flies over to her, dropping several berries he had collected into her hands.] Even Momo does his fair share. \n",
      "TOPH: [Breezily.] Katara, I'm fine. I can carry my own weight. I don't need a fire, [Pats bag.] I've already collected my own food and look, [Earthbends a rock tent over her.] my tent's all set up. \n",
      "KATARA: [Slightly irritated.] Well, that's great for you, but we still need to finish - \n",
      "TOPH: [Angered.] I don't understand what's the problem here! \n",
      "KATARA: [Waves her hand dismissively and walks away.] Never mind. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph earthbends herself into her tent. Later that day, set up continues. Standing on top of Appa, Aang uses airbending to lift the saddle. He mistakenly causes it to land directly on top of Sokka, who had been standing on the ground beside the bison. \n",
      "AANG: [Landing onto the ground to aid Sokka.] Sorry! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to Katara, who sets down a jug of water. She looks over at Toph, sitting comfortably beneath her earth tent. Her dull expression changes to one of slight happiness. She approaches Toph who is eating some sort of food item. \n",
      "KATARA: [Rubs back of head sheepishly.] Hey Toph, I wanted to apologize for earlier. I think we're all just a little tired and getting on each other's nerves. \n",
      "TOPH: [Casually.] Yeah, you do seem pretty tired. \n",
      "KATARA: [Growing disgusted.] I meant all of us. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of inside Toph's earth tent as she lazily tosses the food item onto the ground and lays her head down to rest. \n",
      "TOPH: Well, good night. \n",
      "KATARA: [Slightly irked.] Good night. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara turns around and leaves. The scene changes to nightfall hours later where everyone is asleep. Toph is suddenly startled awake. She rises and presses her left hand to the ground to feel the vibrations within the earth. Close-up on her left hand and ear, indicating she hears something. She rises to her feet and runs out of the tent. \n",
      "TOPH: There's something coming toward us! \n",
      "AANG: What is it? \n",
      "TOPH: [Pressing hand to the ground.] It feels like an avalanche, but also not an avalanche. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sarcastically.] Your powers of perception are frightening. \n",
      "KATARA: Should we leave? \n",
      "AANG: Better safe than sorry. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of the forest, a cloud of smoke billowing toward them in a clearing in the distance. Appa appears on screen, the team riding atop him. Aang leans against the saddle to peer at the object. \n",
      "KATARA: What is that thing? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to a shot of a tank train mechanism racing speedily along the ground. Cuts to shot of the night sky, the moon partly obscured by clouds. Cuts to Aang who yawns sleepily, dark circles beginning to form under his eyes. Cuts to Sokka who appears ready to fall asleep as he leans his head on his hand. Cuts to Toph and Katara sitting on Appa's saddle idly. Cuts to Appa who flies over mountainous terrain and lands on a smooth, rocky surface. \n",
      "TOPH: [Leaping off Appa and lying on the ground, relieved.] Ah, land sweet land! [Rises and says cheerfully.] See you guys in the morning! \n",
      "KATARA: Actually, can you help us unload? \n",
      "TOPH: [Sarcastically.] Really? You need me to help unload Sokka's funky-smelling sleeping bag? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang hands Sokka his sleeping bag which he proceeds to smell. Sokka turns away, his disgusted face growing red, and falls backward, passing out. \n",
      "KATARA: [Curtly.] Well, yeah. That and everything else. You're a part of our team now, and - \n",
      "TOPH: [Points a finger at Katara in irritation.] Look! I didn't ask you to help unload my stuff! [Turns and begins walking away.] I'm carrying my own weight. \n",
      "KATARA: [Angrily.] That's not the point. [Approaches Toph.] Ever since you joined us, you've been nothing but selfish and unhelpful! \n",
      "TOPH: [Enraged.] What? Look here, sugar queen, [Points finger at Katara.] I gave up everything I had so that I could teach Aang earthbending. So don't you talk to me about being selfish! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: While she is saying this, a fuming Katara is seen tensing her muscles in frustration and raising her hand in an attempt to speak. After finished speaking, Toph sits down on the ground and earthbends an earth tent over her. \n",
      "KATARA: [Furiously.] \"Sugar queen\"?! [Toph uses earthbending to close the door of the tent.] D-did you just slam the door in my face?! How can you be so infuriating?! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of Sokka and Aang standing several feet away. Katara angrily bangs her fists against the door of the wall and kicks the tent's walls with her feet. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to later at night, showing shot of the dark forest. Cuts to shot of Aang, Sokka and Katara lying on the ground. Aang is lying on the ground with Momo beside him while Sokka and Katara lie in sleeping bags. \n",
      "KATARA: [Mockingly.] The stars sure are beautiful tonight. Too bad you can't see them, Toph! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph uses earthbending to release a fissure that channels underground and sends Katara flying into the air. She lands on top of Sokka, startling him. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Annoyed; pushes Katara off to the side.] Hey, how's a guy supposed to sleep with all this yelling [To Toph.] and earthquaking? \n",
      "TOPH: [Reopens her tent.] That thing is back! \n",
      "SOKKA: Well, how far away is it? [Lies down and pulls covers of his sleeping bag over his head; says in a muffled voice.] Maybe we can close our eyes just for a few minutes. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to a side-view of Appa flying past a mountain. Fades to scene of him flying between two mountain ridges. The bison lands on his side on a flat-surfaced rock bed, throwing everyone onto the ground along with their belongings. \n",

      "KATARA: [Angrily; pulling her sleeping bag under her head as a pillow.] That's good because Toph wasn't going to help anyway! \n",
      "TOPH: [Irritated; lying on bag.] Oh, I didn't realize the baby still needed someone to tuck her in bed. \n",
      "AANG: Come on guys, there's something after us and we don't even know what [Pulls top part of his shirt over his head; says in a muffled voice.] or who it is. \n",
      "KATARA: It could be Zuko. [Rolls over on her side.] We haven't seem him since the North Pole. \n",
      "TOPH: Who's Zuko? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Puts his head down.] Oh, just some angry freak with a ponytail who's tracked us all over the world. \n",
      "KATARA: [Mockingly.] What's wrong with ponytails, Ponytail? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Points to his top-knot.] This is a warrior's wolf tail. \n",
      "KATARA: [Jokingly.] Well, it certainly tells the other warriors that you're fun and perky. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Raises head, unamused.] Anyway, whoever's chasing us couldn't have followed us here, so, now would everyone just shhh? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo hops onto his sleeping bag and chitters excitedly. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Hold up finger to silence the lemur.] No Momo, shhh. [Relaxes.] Sleepy time. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo hops off Sokka and over to the ledge of the rock. He continues to chitter and raises his ears up in alert. Aang rises, followed by Toph and Katara. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Buries face in hands.] Oh, don't tell me ... \n",
      "AANG: That's impossible. There's no way they could have tracked us. \n",
      "TOPH: I can feel it with my own two feet! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang runs to the edge of the cliff next to Momo and notices smoke rising from the far end of the rocky pathway. Cuts to a shot of the tank train as it rumbles up a slope and onto level ground. \n",

      "SOKKA: Actually Toph, there's four of us. \n",
      "TOPH: [Sheepishly.] Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't count you. You know, no bending and all. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Turning to her, his face distorted with rage.] I can still fight! \n",
      "TOPH: [Smugly.] Okay, three on three plus Sokka. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Face turns red.] Errrgh! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph earthbends three columns in an attempt to hinder the girls, however, the Mongoose Lizards merely leap over the pillars and continues on their way. \n",

      "KATARA: [Shocked.] I can't believe those girls followed us all the way from Omashu. \n",
      "TOPH: [Grumpily.] I still think we could have taken them. \n",
      "KATARA: Are you kidding me? [Points fingers upward repeatedly in gesture.] The crazy blue firebending and the flying daggers are bad enough, but last time we saw them, one of those girls did something that took my bending away. That's scary. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to a shot of the landscape, a prairie below, mountains in the distance. The sun is seen rising over the horizon as Appa soars past. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Complaining.] Oh no, the sun is rising. We've been up all night with no sleep! \n",
      "AANG: [Calmly.] Sokka, we'll be okay. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Nervously.] Are you sure? I've never not slept before! [Holds hands up to his head.] What if I fall asleep now and something happens? [Freaks out; eyes bulge out.] And something always happens! \n",
      "KATARA: Every time we land, those girls are there. So we'll just have to keep flying. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of Appa flying past the sun. \n",
      "AANG: We can't keep flying forever. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to a field where a few flowers are growing. The tank train speeds by rapidly, slicing the heads of the flowers off. Cuts to ground level, indentation marks from the train in the ground and a pair of ostrich horse legs galloping by. Zuko is seen riding on his ostrich horse, a look of determination on his face.

Having awakened, he resumes his normal flight, soaring just above the treetops. Toph, Sokka, Katara and Momo sway to the side still tightly gripping the saddle. Appa soars through the trees, colliding into and snapping several branches. Cuts to shot of the team members who brace against the impact. The camera zooms out to depict a flock of birds resting in the trees, fleeing from the incident, before panning downward to show Appa on the ground, having created a channel way behind him from the impact. Cuts to shot of Appa sleeping once more; Aang slides off his head and onto the ground. \n",
      "AANG: Appa's exhausted. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Trudging across the ground, carrying his sleeping bag.] Okay, we've put in a lot of distance between us and them. The plan right now is to follow Appa's lead and get some sleep. \n",
      "KATARA: [Irritated.] Of course, we could've gotten some sleep earlier, [Depicts shot of Toph lying on the ground sleepily.] if Toph didn't have such issues. \n",
      "TOPH: [Wakes up and slams the ground; screams furiously.] What!? \n",
      "AANG: [Trying to calm the tension.] All right, all right, everyone's exhausted! Let's just get some rest. \n",
      "TOPH: [Rises and faces Katara.] No, I want to hear what Katara has to say. You think I have issues? \n",
      "KATARA: [Irritated.] I'm just saying. Maybe if you helped out earlier, we could have set up our camp faster and gotten some sleep [Shouting.] and then maybe we wouldn't be in this situation! \n",

      "TOPH: You're blaming me for this? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara tosses aside her sleeping bag and gestures with her hands, challenging Toph to move closer. Aang jumps in between the two. \n",
      "AANG: [Desperately.] No! No, she's not blaming you. \n",
      "KATARA: [Angrily.] No, I'm blaming her! \n",
      "TOPH: Hey, [Shoves Aang out of the way.] I never asked you for diddly-doo-dah. [Points her thumb at herself.] I carry my own weight. Besides, if there's anyone to blame, it's Sheddy over here! \n",
      "AANG: [Sitting on Appa's tail.] What? You're blaming Appa? \n",
      "TOPH: Yeah, you want to know how they keep finding us? [Grabs a handful of Appa's fur and lets the sheddings blow away in the wind.] He's leaving a trail everywhere we go! \n",
      "AANG: [Jumps down to face her.] How dare you blame Appa! He saved your life three times today! If there's anyone to blame it's you! You're always talking about how you carry your own weight, but you're not. He is! Appa's carrying your weight. He never had a problem flying when it was just the three of us! \n",
      "TOPH: [Stomps the ground, launching her pack into the air which she catches.] I'm out of here. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Moves in front of Toph, his arms outstretched to halt her.] Wait! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph uses earthbending to shift Sokka off to the side, leaving him surprised. Cuts to shot of fur drifting in the sky. Cuts to ground level view of the tank train speeding across the terrain. Cuts to overhead shot of Aang who raises his arms up, his eyes sorrowful. \n",
      "AANG: What did I just do? [Slumps.] I can't believe I yelled at my earthbending teacher. Now she's gone. \n",
      "KATARA: [Regretfully.] I know. We're all just trying to get used to each other. And I was so mean to her. \n",
      "SOKKA: [From afar, drinking from a cup.] Yeah, you two were pretty much jerks. \n",
      "KATARA: [Sarcastically.] Thanks, Sokka. \n",
      "SOKKA: No problem. \n",
      "KATARA: We need to find Toph and apologize. \n",

Cuts to shot of the river's surface where clumps of fur collect in the water. Cuts to a shot of the top of Appa's head where Momo lands, holding a brush. He scrubs the bison's head and is forced to hastily take flight when a stream of water is bent his way. Cuts to shot of Appa's head, Sokka standing in the river several feet away, holding a brush. He groans as he becomes drenched by the stream of water. The scene changes to the campsite where Appa stands on the ground, his fur still wet from the bath. Sokka can be seen standing by the riverbank, wringing out his shirt. \n",
      "AANG: Toph was right. The fur was leaving a trail right to us. But now that he's clean, no more trail. \n",
      "KATARA: Are you sure he's okay to fly? \n",
      "AANG: He'll be fine as long as we leave his saddle and all our stuff here. [Kneels down and places pieces of Appa's fur into his satchel.] I'm going to use Appa's fur to make a fake trail to lead the tank off-course. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of the treetops. Appa grunts and takes flight, Sokka and Katara riding atop him. As he flies away, his body accidentally brushes against the treetops, snapping the topmost limbs off and causing them to fall to the ground. Aang watches as the bison flies away and turns. Taking a running start, he flies away from the scene on his glider, releasing patches of fur from the bag along the way, creating a misleading trail.\n",

      "Ty Lee somersaults onto the ground. Katara attempts to lash a water whip in her direction, however, is forced to quickly dodge several of the acrobat's blows.

      "IROH: I wasn't thinking that. \n",
      "TOPH: You wouldn't even let me pour my own cup of tea! \n",
      "IROH: I poured your tea because I wanted to and for no other reason. \n",
      "TOPH: People see me and think I'm weak. They want to take care of me, but I can take care of myself, by myself. \n",
      "IROH: You sound like my nephew, always thinking you need to do things on your own, without anyone's support. There is nothing wrong with letting the people who love you help you. Not that I love you, I just met you. \n",
      "TOPH: [Laughs.] So where is your nephew? \n",
      "IROH: I've been tracking him actually. \n",
      "TOPH: Is he lost? \n",
      "IROH: [Looks away; slightly sad.] Yes, a little bit. [Cuts to shot of the rocky ledge where the two sit, the mountain region in the background; voice-over.] His life has recently changed and he's going through very difficult times. He's trying to figure out who he is and he went away. \n",
      "TOPH: So now you're following him. \n",
      "IROH: I know he doesn't want me around him right now, but if he needs me, I'll be there. \n",
      "TOPH: Your nephew is very lucky, even if he doesn't know it. [Gets up to leave.] Thank you. \n",
      "IROH: My pleasure. Sharing tea with a fascinating stranger is one of life's true delights. \n",
      "TOPH: [Happily.] No, thank you for what you said. It helped me. \n",
      "IROH: I'm glad. \n",
      "TOPH: [Rises to leave, but turns around briefly.] Oh, and about your nephew, maybe you should tell him that you need him, too. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Iroh remains silent and sips his tea. The scene changes back to Tu Zin, the camera panning down to depict the town, Azula standing on the opposite side of town as Aang. Cuts briefly to Aang and to Azula who smiles smugly. \n",
      "AZULA: Do you really want to fight me? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko suddenly appears from an alleyway, leaping off his ostrich horse onto the ground, creating a cloud of dust. He stands up straight and throws his conical hat aside. \n",
      "ZUKO: Yes, I really do. \n",
      "AANG: [Alarmed.] Zuko! \n",
      "AZULA: [Calmly.] I was wondering when you'd show up, Zuzu. \n",
      "AANG: [Covers mouth to suppress laughter.] \"Zuzu\"? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Determined.] Back off, Azula! He's mine! \n",
      "AZULA: [Assumes a fighting stance.] I'm not going anywhere. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to overhead shot of the street way where the three opponents stand, prepared for battle. Cuts to shot of Azula, confident as ever. Cuts to shot of Zuko, who averts his gaze first to Azula before looking toward Aang. Cuts to Aang who assumes a fighting stance, pointing his glider at Zuko in fright. Cuts to shot of the three from the perspective of the front porch of a store, the camera panning to the left from Aang to Azula. Cuts to shot of Zuko, who shifts the position of his fingers a bit. Cuts to Aang, who looks about him nervously. Cuts to Azula, who continues to smirk in confidence. Cuts to close-up of Zuko, a shot of Aang, before switching back to Zuko. Cuts to close-up of Azula, whose smile widens. Cuts to brief shot of Zuko.\n",
      "Cuts to Azula, who moves her arm forward, firing a blast of blue fire at Zuko, who conjures up a fire shield to deflect it. He falls backward onto a front porch. Aang, upon seeing this, expresses horror and attempts to flee the town on his glider. He begins soaring toward the back end of Tu Zin. Cuts to Azula, who swings her arm downward, sending a stream of fire at Aang, who turns over mid-air and closes his glider, twirling the object to deflect the flames. Cuts to side-view of the town as he lands on the ground, still deflecting the flames. He stops twirling his glider.\n",
      "Cuts to shot of Azula running along the beam of a rooftop, prepared to strike him. Cuts to ground level shot of Aang who rolls over, grabbing hold of his glider just as Azula lands nimbly on the ground, sweeping around, sending a stream of fire his way. Cuts to shot of the street where Azula rises and turns around, Zuko seen standing in the background. Aang leaps on-screen and lands on the ground, in between the other two. Zuko fires a blast at Aang who steps to the side, managing to avoid the attack. Azula fires at the Avatar and misses.\n",
      "After the three perform several unsuccessful attempts to land a blow, Aang runs past Azula, who sends another sweep of fire his way. Cut to slanted shot of three, Aang trying to escape toward the back end of town, Azula turning to face him and Zuko firing blasts of his own. Aang rounds a bend and runs past Azula once more, this time heading toward the front of town. Azula fires another blast at him, only to miss. Azula fires several more blows, one of which Zuko manages to deflect. He fires a shot at Azula and misses.\n",
      "Cuts to shot of Azula, who swings her arms about, sending attacks at her opponents. Cuts to overhead shot of the town, the three of them continuing to battle each other. Cuts to shot of Azula, Zuko appearing on-screen, leaping into the air directly behind her and striking the ground, unleashing a firebending attack in the process. Cuts to side-view of the two siblings as two walls of fire, one blue and one orange are created as a result of the impact. Azula fires a blast at Zuko, who ducks and attempts to knock her off her feet. He fires a blast her only for the princess to duck. She sweeps her arm upward, sending a stream of fire his way. Zuko leaps into the air to avoid the attack. Azula turns around and fires at Aang. Cuts to shot of the Avatar, who leaps into the air and lands onto an upper outdoors level of a nearby building.\n",
      "Azula runs up the stairwell leading to the upper level, forcing Aang to run through the open doorway. Cuts to shot of the inside of the doorway; Azula appears on-screen and her expression suddenly grows alarmed. She halts in her tracks and nearly stumbles. Cuts to view of the entire inside of the building, revealing that there is no floor, merely some jagged wooden paneling lining the edges of the wall. She windmills in an attempt to steady herself. Cuts to Aang perched atop an air ball, smiling gleefully and waving to her. After leaping about a few times, Azula manages to prop herself against the wall and regains her balance. Zuko suddenly appears in the doorway. He has the misfortune of inaccurate timing and falls roughly onto the first level floor with a yell, sending up a cloud of dust. Aang grimaces in sympathy.\n",
      "The air ball Aang is riding suddenly begins to dissipates. Cuts to Azula, who nimbly sends a blast of fire at him. Cuts back to Aang, who leaps out of the way just as the air ball is terminated. He runs along the edges along the thin floor paneling and knocks Azula onto the first floor in the process. Azula lands nimbly onto the ground near Zuko, who is still recovering from his fall. Cuts to the outside of the building as Aang exits through the doorway, narrowly avoiding a blue fire blast sent by Azula off-screen.\n",
      "He lands onto the ground just as Azula bursts through the wall of the building through the use of firebending. Zuko lands on the ground unconscious. Cuts to shot of Aang, who looks at Zuko before turning around and seeing Azula heading straight toward him. He flees and leaps out of the way just as Azula sends another blast at him. Aang begins alternately jumping between two buildings, with Azula firing blasts off-screen at each spot he lands on. Aang finally reaches the rooftop of the left building and scrambles to prop himself up.\n",
      "Azula sends a blast of fire, slicing a portion of the rooftop off. Aang leaps off the crumbling portion onto another spot on the roof, only for Azula to repeat the same action. Cuts to shot Aang, who scrambles to prop himself up only for the ceiling to cave in. He lands on the ground inside the building, trapped beneath a pile of wooden planks. Azula enters the building through the doorway and sends two streams of fire along the sides of the wall. The blue fire spreads around the perimeter of the room and turns an orange hue. Cuts to Aang, who looks horrified and attempts to break free.\n",
      "Cuts to Azula, who smirks and holds up one hand, two fingers pointing outward, her typical lightning generation pose. Katara suddenly appears in the doorway and sends a water whip at Azula, guiding her hand off course. Katara bends the stream of water around her and slices the wooden planks, thus freeing Aang. \n",
      "AANG: [Thrilled.] Katara! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Azula swiftly turns around and fires a blast at the waterbender, who races out of the building along the porch. Azula follows her in hot pursuit, only to be halted by Sokka, who emerges from another doorway and swings his machete her way. Katara runs off-camera, while Azula is forced to duck. Sokka begins chasing her. Cuts to overhead shot of the town where Azula is now being cornered by him, Katara and Aang. Cuts to shot of Zuko still lying on the ground as he regains consciousness. Cuts to shot of Iroh standing over him from his perspective, the shot slightly blurred to show the effect of being knocked out. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Slightly dazed.] Uncle ... \n",
      "IROH: Get up! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He helps Zuko get up. Cuts to shot of Aang as he runs straight toward Azula, his back facing the camera. He leaps over her just as Azula fires a blast at him which heads directly toward the camera. She turns around and blocks a water whip Katara sends at her. She fires a blast at Sokka and swings her arm outward to prolong the blast. Aang appears on-screen behind her. She turns around and nearly manages to strike him with another blast. Cuts to overhead shot of the three Team Avatar members and Azula, who swings her arm outward, sending an arched fire blast at the three. Cuts to shot of Azula who stands, poised for attack. Camera pans downward to her feet. She suddenly falls over to the side; Toph appears from an alleyway, having just shifted the ground beneath her feet. \n",
      "TOPH: I thought you guys could use a little help. \n",
      "KATARA: [Happily.] Thanks. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Azula rises to her feet and begins running away. Cuts to shot from the view of an alleyway, where Azula appears on-screen and runs through the alley. She leaps over some crates and tries to escape, however, Iroh intervenes, using his rotund belly to knock her off her feet. Zuko appears on-screen next to him. Cuts to overhead shot of Aang, Katara, Sokka, Toph, Zuko and Iroh all cornering Azula against the ruins of a stone wall. \n",
      "AZULA: [Coolly, backing up as her enemies surround her.] Well, look at this. Enemies and traitors, all working together. I'm done. [Raises her hands in surrender.] I know when I'm beaten. You got me. A princess surrenders with honor. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of Iroh, who averts his gaze toward the other members, who remain on high alert. The camera switches to his point of view, zooming in on Toph and shifting upward to Aang, Katara and Sokka, who still assume fighting stances. Cuts briefly to Azula, who smirks, before switching to Toph from Iroh's point of view. Cuts to Azula, who smiles and takes a step forward, firing a blast at Iroh, who gets hit. He screams in pain and falls to the ground. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Horrified.] Aaaah! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The remaining five turn to face Azula, four of them bending their respective elements and Sokka throwing his boomerang straight for her. The impact of the elements creates a minor explosion, sending a thick cloud of smoke everywhere. Cuts to buildings in the town now set alight, burning embers falling from the sky. Cuts to shot of Aang as the smoke clears, who looks from his defensive position at the effect. Cuts overhead shot of the group surrounding the corner, the smoke clearing to reveal Azula having vanished from the scene without a trace. Cuts to Zuko, who kneels before his uncle, dismayed at the turn of events. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Angrily.] Ugggh! [Looks at Team Avatar.] Get away from us! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to Toph, the camera shifting to her foot, showing that she can detect the vibrations using seismic sense. Cuts to Iroh, who is still breathing, indicating that he is still alive. Katara approaches Zuko. \n",
      "KATARA: Zuko, I can help. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Blasts an arc of fire.] Leave! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The members of Team Avatar all run away off-screen, leaving Zuko still kneeling over Iroh. The camera pans upward to show thick smoke billowing from the fire. The scene fades to a mountain at nightfall where Appa lands. Cuts to shot of Team Avatar sleeping on the saddle. Camera zooms in on Toph and Katara resting next to each other. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fades to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens in a mountainous terrain at sunrise as it pans down and to the right. All of Team Avatar is sleeping. Cut to Aang rising and jumping up with airbending, barefoot, and filled with excitement. \n",
      "AANG: Today's the day! [Lands near a sleeping Sokka.] Can you believe it? After all that time searching for a teacher, I'm finally starting earthbending! [Momo chitters and lands on Sokka.] And this place, [Momo moves on to Appa's head.] it's perfect, don't you think? Sokka? [Sokka grumbles and glares at Aang with tired eyes.] Oh, you're still sleeping, huh? [Sokka again grumbles and puts his head back down. Aang whispers.] Sorry. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The ground shakes, causing Aang to turn to look toward the source of the rumbling. The camera quickly pans to the left to an earth tent, the slabs of which are tossed in every direction mere moments after. As the dust clears, Toph is standing in the middle with her left hand raised in the air. \n",
      "TOPH: Goooood morning, [She puts both her hands on her hips.] earthbending student! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the side-shot of Appa, with Momo on his head, Sokka, still sleeping and curled up within his sleeping bag with Aang standing at his feet, and Katara, who is sitting upright in her own sleeping bag. Toph walks over to them. \n",
      "AANG: Good morning, Sifu Toph. \n",
      "KATARA: [Aang bows slightly to Toph; disappointed and tiredly.] Hey, you never called me Sifu Katara. \n",
      "AANG: [Scratches the back of his head.] Well, if you think I should ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka suddenly sits up, grumbling at Aang. Cut to a closer shot of Aang, who looks down in wonder, and Toph, who has a smile on her face. \n",
      "TOPH: Sorry, Snoozles, we'll do our earthbending as [Whispers slightly, though with amusement in her voice.] quietly as we can. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a close-up of Toph's feet as she slams her left heel into the ground, creating a crack. Cut to a side-shot of Sokka, who had laid himself back down. An earth pillar rises up right underneath him, catapulting him screaming into the air. Cut to an aerial shot of the team's camping spot as Sokka flies directly toward the camera. After he has flown so close to the camera that the shot was nothing more than a close-up of this uvula, the scene cuts back to ground level of the campsite, where Katara is standing up and joins Toph and Aang in looking toward the sky. Sokka crashes to the ground in their middle with a loud thud. He immediately jumps to his feet, still in his sleeping bag with only his head visible, and hops toward Aang while grumbling. He stops in front of the Avatar and grumbles to his face, before jumping toward Toph and doing the same to her. He subsequently hops toward the camera and out of the shot, still grumbling angrily. Everyone else turns to watch him go.\n",
      "Cut to Toph staring after Sokka with her hands to her sides. Aang had jumped up and now softly lands beside her. \n",
      "AANG: [Excitedly.] So what move are you going to teach me first? [Stretches out his right arm, his fist clenched, and brings it down like a hammer.] Rock-a-lanche? [He brings his left clenched fist to his right elbow, while his right arm is bent upward, the fist also clenched. He trembles with the motion.] The Trembler? Oh, maybe I could learn to make a [Stretches both arms over his head and starts to spin around.] whirlpool out of land! \n",
      "TOPH: [Puts a hand on Aang's chest.] Let's start with ... [Makes the gesture.] move a rock. \n",
      "AANG: [Claps excitedly.] Sounds good, sounds good! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to another part of the canyon where Toph and Aang are standing in front of two rocks as Katara watches. \n",
      "TOPH: The key to earthbending is your stance. You've got to be steady and strong. Rock is a stubborn element. If you're going to move it, you've got to be like a rock yourself. \n",
      "AANG: Like a rock. Got it. \n",
      "TOPH: Good. Now the actual motion of this one is pretty simple. [Slams the rock against the canyon wall.] Okay, you ready to give it a try? \n",
      "AANG: I'm ready. [Tries to move it, but instead he is forced backward into Appa.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Amused.] Rock beats airbender! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Iroh has a flashback in a dream about Lu Ten. Lu Ten pretends to firebend at Iroh who fakes a groan and falls over. \n",
      "LU.TEN: I got you, Dad! [Playfully jumps on top of Iroh.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Both laugh as the scene fades to Iroh in a dream sitting over Lu Ten's tomb. \n",
      "IROH: My beloved Lu Ten, I will see you again. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene fades again as Iroh wakes up to Zuko calling him. \n",
      "ZUKO: Uncle ... you were unconscious. Azula did this to you. It was a surprise attack. \n",
      "IROH: Somehow, that's not so surprising. [Groans.] \n",
      "ZUKO: [Hands Iroh some tea.] I hope I made it the way you like it. [Iroh takes a sip from the cup and his eyes widen. He lets out a cry of disgust, but manages to mask it.] \n",
      "IROH: [Grimaces.] Good. That was very ... uhhh ... bracing. [He is handed another cup, which he throws out secretly behind his shoulder.] \n",
      "ZUKO: So Uncle, I've been thinking. It's only a matter of time before I run into Azula again. I'm going to need to know more advanced firebending if I want to stand a chance against her. I know what you're going to say: she's my sister and I should be trying to get along with her. \n",
      "IROH: [With the exact opposite of Zuko's thoughts.] No, she's crazy, and she needs to go down. [Zuko nods. Iroh grunts as he stands up.] It's time to resume your training. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back at the canyon. Katara and Toph are standing next to the boulder Aang tried to move. Aang walks up, a hand behind his head. \n",
      "KATARA: I don't understand what went wrong. He did it exactly the way you did. \n",
      "AANG: Maybe there's another way ... what if I came at the boulder from another angle? \n",
      "TOPH: No. That's the problem. You've got to stop thinking like an airbender. There's no different angle, no clever solution, no trickety-trick that's going to move that rock. You've got to face it head on. And when I say head on, I mean like this ... [Jumps up and destroys the rock with her head.] \n",
      "AANG: Whoa! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph begins to walk away, but Katara stops her. \n",
      "KATARA: [Trying to help Toph teach.] I've been training Aang for a while now. He really responds well to a positive teaching experience. Lots of encouragement and praise. Kind words. If he's doing something wrong, maybe a gentle nudge in the right direction. \n",
      "TOPH: Thanks, Katara. A gentle nudge. I'll try that. [Moments later; yelling at the top of her lungs.] Keep your knees high, Twinkle Toes! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Aang carrying a large rock on his back, struggling to hold it up. The camera zooms out, showing Toph in the background stomping down and causing pillars of rock to rise underneath Aang's feet as he walks. Aang loses his balance and falls off-screen.\n",
      "The next move shows Toph digging through rock with her fingers. The camera pans over and Aang rubs his hands together and tries to do the same thing, but smashes his hand against the rock and grunts in pain. \n",
      "TOPH: Rock-like! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Next, Toph gives Aang one of Sokka's weapons, much to Sokka's dismay. Cut to Sokka's face with Toph's hand holding him back. He grunts, trying to move forward. Cut to a side-view, showing Sokka struggling to get his club back from Toph, who is holding it to the side and preventing Sokka from grabbing it. She shoves him backward and he stalks offscreen. She hands the weapon to Aang. He is blindfolded as he tries to smash rocks Toph brings up. He finally gets one after about five times. Cut to Toph, who nods in approval.\n",
      "During their next session, Toph builds herself into a shield of rock which Aang has to push back over a marked boundary. He is successful. His training begins to move smoothly.\n",
      "During another training session Aang is standing on two pillars of earth tossing a rock into the air while switching hands to catch it each time. Toph walks between the two pillars of earth and uses earthbending to shake the pillars. \n",
      "TOPH: Rock-like! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera pans up to reveal Aang holding a solid stance without losing his balance. Toph appears on a pillar near him and nods. Aang smiles, knowing he is finally getting the hang of it.\n",
      "In another part of the canyon, Sokka is looking for food when he stumbles upon an animal. \n",
      "SOKKA: You're awfully cute, but unfortunately you're made of meat. Just a bit closer ... [Jumps but falls into a crack that is in the ground. He looks at the cub.] Gotcha! [Sinks further in.] You are one lucky little meat creature. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back at Iroh and Zuko's setup. \n",
      "IROH: Lightning is a pure form of firebending, without aggression. It is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is. Some call lightning the cold-blooded fire. It is precise and deadly, like Azula. To perform the technique requires peace of mind. \n",
      "ZUKO: I see. That's why we're drinking tea, to calm the mind. \n",
      "IROH: Oh yeah, good point! I mean, yes. [Outside.] There is energy all around us. The energy is both yin and yang. Positive energy and negative energy. Only a select few firebenders can separate these energies. This creates an imbalance. The energy wants to restore balance, and in a moment the positive and negative energy come crashing back together, you provide release and guidance, creating lightning. [Steps up, and generates lightning, and shoots it away from the two.] \n",
      "ZUKO: I'm ready to try it! \n",
      "IROH: Remember, once you separate the energy, you do not command it. You are simply its humble guide. Breathe first. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko takes a deep breath. He tries to generate lightning, but instead an explosion launches him back. Iroh shakes his head in disappointment. \n",
      "Back at the canyon, Aang's earthbending training continues. \n",
      "TOPH: This time we're going to try something a little different. Instead of moving a rock, you're going to stop a rock. Get in your horse stance! I'm going to roll that boulder down at you. If you have the attitude of an earthbender, you'll stay in your stance and stop the rock. Like this! [Stretches out, still in stance.] \n",
      "KATARA: Sorry Toph, but are you really sure this is the way to teach Aang earthbending? \n",
      "TOPH: I'm glad you said something. Actually there is a better way. [Blindfolds Aang.] This way, you'll actually have to sense the vibrations of the boulder to stop it. Thank you, Katara. \n",
      "AANG: [Sarcastically.] Yeah, thanks, Katara! \n",
      "KATARA: [Nervously.] Heh. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Toph standing at the top of the hill with Aang at the bottom. She shoves the rock forward and it begins to roll down the slope. Aang looks worried and afraid as it rolls toward him. He jumps over the boulder at the last second, causing it to roll past and crash into the cliff. Toph comes running toward Aang. \n",
      "AANG: I guess I just panicked. I don't know what to say. \n",
      "TOPH: There's nothing to say, you blew it! You had a perfect stance, and a perfect form. But when it came right down to it, you didn't have the guts! \n",
      "AANG: [Disappointed.] I know. I'm sorry. \n",
      "TOPH: Yeah, you are sorry! If you're not tough enough to stop the rock, then you can at least give it the pleasure of smashing you instead of jumping out of the way like a jelly-boned wimp! Now, do you have what it takes to face that rock like an earthbender? \n",
      "AANG: No, I don't think I do. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, it's no big deal. You'll take a break and try earthbending again when you're ready. Besides, you still have a lot of waterbending to work on. Okay? \n",
      "AANG: Yeah, that sounds good. \n",
      "TOPH: Yeah, whatever, go splash around until you feel better. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They all exit. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back to Zuko and Iroh. Another attempt by Zuko to generate lightning fails. \n",
      "ZUKO: Why can't I do it? Instead of lightning it keeps exploding in my face ... like everything always does. \n",
      "IROH: I was afraid this might happen. You will not be able to master lightning until you have dealt with the turmoil inside you. \n",
      "ZUKO: What turmoil? \n",
      "IROH: Zuko, you must let go of your feelings of shame if you want your anger to go away. \n",
      "ZUKO: But I don't feel any shame at all. I'm as proud as ever. \n",
      "IROH: Prince Zuko, pride is not the opposite of shame, but its source. True humility is the only antidote to shame. \n",
      "ZUKO: Well, my life has been nothing but humbling lately. \n",
      "IROH: I have another idea. I will teach you a firebending move that even Azula doesn't know, because I made it up myself. [Zuko smiles.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back to Sokka, who remains trapped with the small, brown animal. \n",
      "SOKKA: You probably think I deserve this, don't you? Look, I'm sorry I hunted you, but that's just the natural order of things. Big things eat smaller things, nothing personal. But this time it didn't work out that way. I admit it ... you're cute. Okay, you convinced me, if I get out of this alive, it's a karmically correct, vegetarian existence for me. No meat. Even though meat is so tasty. [The cub brings an apple.] Hey, looks like my karma is already paying off! That's okay, I got it. [Tosses his boomerang at it in a desperate attempt.] Now, come back boomerang. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: In a pond in another part of the canyon. Momo tries to grab a frog. Aang and Katara move a single blob of water back and forth among each other in a circular motion. \n",
      "KATARA: You know this block you're having is only temporary, right? \n",
      "AANG: I don't want to talk about it. \n",
      "KATARA: You do realize that's the problem, don't you? If you face this issue instead of avoiding it– \n",
      "AANG: [Frustrated at himself.] I know, I know, I know, I know! I get it, all right? I need to face it head on like a rock, but I just can't do it. I don't know why I can't, but I can't. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, if fire and water are opposites, then what's the opposite of air? \n",
      "AANG: I guess it's earth. \n",
      "KATARA: That's why it's so difficult for you to get this. You're working with your natural opposite. But you'll figure it out. I know you will. Think fast! [Throws a piece of grass at him, but Aang stops it with waterbending.] Excellent. You have the reflexes of a waterbending master. \n",
      "AANG: Thanks, Katara. Sifu Katara. [Bows.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara also bows at Aang. Back to Zuko and Iroh. \n",
      "IROH: Fire is the element of power. [Draws the firebending insignia in the dirt.] The people of the Fire Nation have desire and will, and the energy to drive and achieve what they want. Earth is the element of substance. [Draws the earthbending insignia.] The people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse and strong. They are persistent and enduring. Air is the element of freedom. [Draws the airbending insignia.] The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom. Also, they apparently had pretty good senses of humor! Water is the element of change. [Draws the waterbending insignia.] The people of the Water Tribe are capable of adapting to many things. They have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything. \n",
      "ZUKO: Why are you telling me these things? \n",
      "IROH: It is important to draw wisdom from many different places. If you take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and stale. [Divides the four insignias into separate sections.] Understanding others, the other elements, and the other nations will help you become whole. [Draws a circle around the insignias.] \n",
      "ZUKO: All this four elements talk is sounding like Avatar stuff. \n",
      "IROH: It is the combination of the four elements in one person that makes the Avatar so powerful. But it can make you more powerful, too. You see the technique I'm about to teach you is one I learned by studying the waterbenders. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back to the campsite. Aang is meditating when Toph enters, holding Aang's staff. \n",
      "TOPH: Aang, I found these nuts in your bag. I figured you wouldn't mind. And besides, even if you did, you're too much of a pushover to do anything about it. \n",
      "AANG: As a matter of fact, I don't mind. I'm happy to share anything I have. \n",
      "TOPH: You know, I'm really glad you feel that way. Because I also have this great new nutcracker. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She spins Aang's staff above her head. Cut to Aang, who looks over his shoulder with a pained expression on his face. Cut to Toph as she smiles widely, lifts the staff, and starts using it to break nutshells. \n",
      "AANG: Actually, I prefer if you didn't ... [Crack.] That's an antique, handcrafted by the monks ... [Crack.] It's a delicate instrument! \n",
      "TOPH: It's not the only delicate instrument around here. [Walks away, hitting the staff off rocks.] \n",
      "AANG: [Resumes meditating.] Ohm. \n",
      "KATARA: Hey Aang, have you seen– \n",
      "AANG: [Frustrated.] Meditating here! \n",
      "KATARA: It's important. It's almost sundown and Sokka isn't back yet. I think we should search for him. \n",
      "AANG: We'll find him faster if we split up. [The two begin to search.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back to Sokka. \n",
      "SOKKA: Okay, karma person or thing, whoever's in charge of this stuff. If I can just get out of this situation alive, I will give up meat and sarcasm. Okay? [Sokka's warrior's wolf tail gets yanked out of his hair by the cub.] Ow! That's all I got. It's pretty much my whole identity. Sokka, the meat and sarcasm guy. But I'm willing to be Sokka, the veggies and straight talk fellow. Deal? [Aang shows up.] Aang! Thank goodness! Have you got any meat? \n",
      "AANG: Sokka! Are you okay? [Tries to pull him out.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Aggh, stop, stop! You're going to pull my fingers off and I don't think the rest of me is coming! \n",
      "AANG: Hmmm ... I bet I can airbend you out of here. [Blows up a gust of wind but Sokka remains trapped.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Seriously Aang, I know you're new at it, but I could use a little earthbending here. How about it? \n",
      "AANG: I can't ... I can't do it. \n",
      "SOKKA: Well, if you can't earthbend me out of here, go get Toph. \n",
      "AANG: I can't do that either. \n",
      "SOKKA: You can't? Why not? \n",
      "AANG: It would just be really ... uncomfortable. \n",
      "SOKKA: Uncomfortable? [Sarcastically.] Well, I wouldn't want you to feel uncomfortable ... \n",
      "AANG: Thanks, Sokka. This whole earthbending thing really has me confused. There's so much pressure. Everyone expects me to get it right away. It puts me in a really awkward position. \n",
      "SOKKA: Awkward position, I think I know the feeling. \n",
      "AANG: If I try, I fail. If I don't try, I'm never going to get it. I feel like I'm caught between a rock and a hard place. \n",
      "SOKKA: Hmmm ... how about that. Aang, this is my friend, Foo Foo Cuddlypoops. Foo Foo Cuddlypoops, Aang. \n",
      "AANG: Awww, what a cute name for a baby saber-tooth moose-lion cub. \n",
      "SOKKA: Really? He looks nothing like a saber-tooth moose-lion. \n",
      "AANG: It's hard to tell before their giant teeth and horns grow in. What are you doing out here little guy? Did you lose your mama? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Suddenly, a large moose-lion appears. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts back to Zuko and Iroh. \n",
      "IROH: Waterbenders deal with the flow of energy. A waterbender lets their defense become their offense, turning their opponents' energy against them. I learned a way to do this with lightning. \n",
      "ZUKO: You can teach me to redirect lightning? \n",
      "IROH: If you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it. You must create a pathway from your fingertips, up your arm to your shoulder, then down into your stomach. The stomach is the source of energy in your body. It is called the sea of chi. Only in my case it is more like a vast ocean. [Laughs.] From the stomach, you direct it up again, and out the other arm. The stomach detour is critical. You must not let the lightning pass through your heart, or the damage could be deadly. You may wish to try a physical motion, to get a feel for the pathways' flow, like this. [The two begin to practice the redirection motion.] Now, are you focusing your energy? Can you feel your own chi flowing in, down, up, and out? \n",
      "ZUKO: I think so. \n",
      "IROH: Come on, you've got to feel the flow. [They practice the motion for a few minutes.] Excellent! You've got it! \n",
      "ZUKO: Great, I'm ready to try it with real lightning! \n",
      "IROH: What, are you crazy? Lightning is very dangerous! \n",
      "ZUKO: I thought that was the point! You teaching me to protect myself from it! \n",
      "IROH: Yeah! But I'm not going to shoot lightning at you! If you're lucky, you will never have to use this technique at all! \n",
      "ZUKO: Well, if you won't help me, I'll find my own lightning. [Rides away.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back to the canyon, Aang begins to talk to the saber-tooth moose-lion mother. \n",
      "AANG: Hey there, we found your cub! See, we have no problem with you! We're friendly! \n",
      "SOKKA: Aang, this is bad, you've got to get me out of here! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The moose-lion charges at Sokka, but Aang sends it over his head with airbending. \n",
      "SOKKA: This is really bad! Please Aang, you have to earthbend me out, there's no other way! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang tries, but all his attempts produce nothing. \n",
      "AANG: Oh no! [Gets on top of a rock to try and distract the saber-tooth moose-lion.] Woo-hoo, look at me! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The moose-lion charges again but is again held off. \n",
      "SOKKA: Please, don't leave me again. \n",
      "AANG: I won't. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He stands his ground, and at the last second, throws the moose-lion back with a blast of air. The beast leaves. Suddenly, slight clapping can be heard. Cut to shot of Toph sitting on a rock nearby. \n",
      "SOKKA: What are you doing here? \n",
      "TOPH: Just enjoying the show. \n",
      "AANG: What? You were there the whole time? \n",
      "TOPH: Pretty much. \n",
      "AANG: Why didn't you do something? Sokka was in trouble! I was in trouble! You could have gotten him out and helped us get away! \n",
      "TOPH: Guess it just didn't occur to me. [Throws a nut down and attempts to crack it with the staff.] \n",
      "AANG: [Grabs hold of it.] Enough! I want my staff back! [Takes it away.] \n",
      "TOPH: Do it now! \n",
      "AANG: What? \n",
      "TOPH: Earthbend, Twinkle Toes. You just stood your ground against a crazy beast. And even more impressive, you stood your ground against me. You've got stuff. \n",
      "AANG: But– \n",
      "TOPH: Do it! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang slams the ground and sends a rock into the canyon wall. \n",
      "TOPH: You did it! You're an earthbender. \n",
      "AANG: I can't believe it! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sarcastically.] Awww, this is a really wonderful, touching moment. So could you get me out of here so I can give you both a big, snuggly hug? \n",
      "AANG: No problem, Sokka! \n",
      "TOPH: Actually, you should probably let me do that. You're still a little new to this. You might accidentally crush him. \n",
      "SOKKA: Yeah, no crushing, please. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph kicks up the rock and yanks him out. Nightfall hits. Katara meets up with them. \n",
      "KATARA: You found him! [Embraces Sokka.] \n",
      "SOKKA: The whole time, I was in that hole, not knowing if I was going to live or die. It makes a man to think about what's really important. I realized– \n",
      "AANG: [Interrupting Sokka.] Hey Katara, look what I can do! [Bends a rock and slams it on the ground.] \n",
      "KATARA: You did it! I knew you would! [Whispering to Toph.] You tried the positive reinforcement, didn't you? \n",
      "TOPH: [Happily.] Yep, it worked wonders. \n",
      "AANG: Appa, Appa, I can earthbend now! The key is being completely rooted. Physically and mentally unmovable! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa licks him and sends him flying a few feet. Sokka laughs hysterically, and Aang laughs as well. Meanwhile, Zuko has tracked down a storm, seeking lightning. \n",
      "ZUKO: You've always thrown everything you could at me! Well, I can take it, and now I can give it back! [Yelling as loud as he can at the storm.] Come on, strike me! You've never held back before! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: No lightning strikes. Tears stream down Zuko's cheeks, and he yells at the top of his lungs. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode begins with a view of the mountains. The camera pans down to show a back shot of Aang sitting in cross legged in a prairie on the ground looking over a vast open savanna landscape. The landscape is mostly barren save for small shoots of grass which bend in the breeze. A range of mountains can be seen in the distance. The ground in front of Aang is littered with holes.\n",
      "Cut to a shot of the group from the front of Appa, Sokka, Toph, Katara, and Momo standing behind Aang. The Avatar is holding a thin wooden flute in both hands. \n",
      "SOKKA: What's out here? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Shot changes to show Appa, Sokka, Toph, Katara, and Momo standing behind Aang, who holds a flute. \n",
      "TOPH: [Puts her hand on the ground.] A lot, actually. There's hundreds of little ... \n",
      "AANG: [Turns around and silences Toph.] Shh! I know you can see underground, but don't ruin the surprise. Just watch. [Blows a note on the flute. A groundhog-type creature pops out of a hole in the ground and mimics the note.] Yeah! [Plays another note and another groundhog mimics it.] I'm putting an orchestra together. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Makes hand motions while looking on with annoyance.] Orchestra, huh? Well, la-di-da. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Three groundhogs pop out of the ground and sing descending notes. Momo jumps into a hole and comes out the middle one, trying to catch the groundhogs. The shot shows all of the holes in the ground. Aang plays four notes and Momo tries to catch the groundhogs that pop up. Aang plays another note as Sokka runs up to Aang and plugs the flute with his finger, causing nothing to play. As Aang's cheeks swell with air, the Avatar looks at Sokka with a sad expression. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Annoyed.] This is great and all, but don't we have more important things to worry about? We should be making plans. \n",
      "TOPH: We did make plans. We're all picking mini-vacations. \n",
      "SOKKA: There's no time for vacations. \n",
      "AANG: I'm learning the elements as fast as I can. I practice hard every day with Toph and Katara. I've been training my arrow off! \n",
      "KATARA: [Walks next to Aang.] Yeah, what's wrong with having a little fun in our down time? \n",
      "SOKKA: Even if you do master all of the elements, then what? It's not like we have a map of the Fire Nation. [Gestures to the side, sarcastically.] Should we just head west until we reach the Fire Lord's house? [Knocking on an imaginary door.] Knock, knock. Hello, Fire Lord? Anybody home? I don't think so. We need some intelligence if we're going to win this war. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang plays a note on the flute and a groundhog pops up underneath Sokka and sings the note. \n",
      "KATARA: All right, we'll finish our vacations and [Mockingly.] then we'll look for Sokka's intelligence. [Aang laughs.] \n",
      "AANG: [Opening a map and shows it to Katara.] Your turn, Katara. Where would you like to go on your mini-vacation? \n",
      "KATARA: [Pointing at the map.] How about the Misty Palms Oasis? That sounds refreshing. \n",
      "AANG: Oh, yeah, I've been there. It's a pristine natural ice spring. And I usually don't use the word \"pristine\". [Cut to the symbol on the map.] It's one of nature's wonders. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The close-up of the map's illustration fades to the Misty Palm Oasis, which has a small ice spring in the center. Cut to a shot of Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Toph stare at the oasis in disappointment. \n",
      "AANG: Must've changed ownership since I was here. [Laughs sheepishly.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They walk through the entrance and the hanging sign falls down. Fade to Team Avatar walking past the small ice spring. They walk into the bar and pass five sandbenders hanging around outside. One sandbender spits at Sokka's feet. Sokka looks at the man angrily. The man utters a raspy groan, slurps, and chuckles. Katara grabs Sokka and pulls him into the bar, which is filled with weary travelers. \n",
      "ZEI: [To the bartender.] One mango, please. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The bartender uses two swords to slice a bowl from a large chunk of ice. He cuts down some mangos from the overhanging fruit and dices them up. He chops up a piece of fruit and pours a jug of milk into the bowl, still using the swords. He throws a decorative umbrella and straw into the bowl and serves it to Zei, who gives the bartender a coin. \n",
      "SOKKA: I don't see anything wrong with having one of those fruity beverages while we plan our strategy. [Runs up to the bartender.] Excuse me. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zei bumps into Aang and spills his drink onto the airbender. \n",
      "AANG: No worries, I clean up easy. [Airbends the drink off of his clothes.] \n",
      "ZEI: [Gasps.] You're a living relic. \n",
      "AANG: [Shrugs.] Thanks, I try. \n",
      "ZEI: An Air Nomad, right in front of me. [Shot changes to show Katara holding an icy bowl.] Professor Zei, head of anthropology at Ba Sing Se University. [Grabs Aang's arm and points at his arrow tattoo. Camera pans to Aang's face.] Tell me, which of the air temples do you hail from? \n",
      "AANG: The Southern Temple. \n",
      "ZEI: [Measures Aang's head with a pair of calipers and speaking excitedly.] Oh, splendid! Now tell me- what was the primary agricultural product of your people? \n",
      "AANG: [Nervously.] Uh, are fruit pies an agricultural product? \n",
      "ZEI: Oh, truly fascinating. That is one for the journal. [While Sokka speaks, Zei writes in his journal.] \n",
      "SOKKA: So Professor, you're obviously a well-traveled guy. Do you have a more current map? Ours seems to be a little dated. \n",
      "ZEI: Certainly. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka unrolls a map on a table and examines. Toph sips her drink and props her legs on another chair. \n",
      "SOKKA: What, no Fire Nation? [Straightening his back.] Doesn't anybody have a good map of that place? \n",
      "KATARA: [Examines the map while the camera pans across it.] You've made a lot of trips into the desert. \n",
      "ZEI: All in vain, I'm afraid. I've found lost civilizations all over the Earth Kingdom, [Raises his fist slightly.] but I haven't managed to find the crown jewel: Wan Shi Tong's Library. [Cut to a shot of Toph laying down. Her feet are closest to the camera, showing her dirt-stained soles.] \n",
      "TOPH: [In disbelief.] You spent years walking through the desert to find some guy's library? \n",
      "ZEI: This library is more valuable than gold, little lady. It is said to contain a vast collection of knowledge, and knowledge is priceless. \n",
      "TOPH: [Sarcastically.] Hmm, sounds like good times. \n",
      "ZEI: Oh, it is. According to legend, it was built by the great Knowledge Spirit, Wan Shi Tong, with the help of his \"foxy\" knowledge seekers. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Intrigued.] Oh, so this spirit has attractive assistants, huh? \n",
      "KATARA: [Puts her hand on the side of Sokka's face to stop him from talking.] I think he means they look like actual foxes, Sokka. \n",
      "ZEI: You're both right. [Katara and Sokka turn to him in surprise. Cut to Zei.] Handsome little creatures. [Takes out a drawing of the library and places it on the table.] Wan Shi Tong and his knowledge seekers collected books from all over the world, and put them on display for mankind to read, so that we might better ourselves. \n",
      "SOKKA: If this place has books from all over the world, [Aang walks over to look at the maps while he sips his drink.] do you think they've got info on the Fire Nation? A map, maybe? \n",
      "ZEI: I wouldn't know. But if such a thing exists, it's in Wan Shi Tong's Library. \n",
      "SOKKA: Then it's settled. Aang, I do believe it's my turn. I'd like to spend my vacation [Cut to a shot of Sokka as he points his finger into the air dramatically. The background changes to a rushing one.] at the library! [Sokka's voice echoes. Zoom back to a group shot, with Sokka still having his finger raised in the air.] \n",
      "TOPH: [Waving her hand to gain the others attention.] Uh, hey, what about me? When do I get to pick? \n",
      "SOKKA: You gotta work here a little longer before you qualify for vacation time. \n",
      "TOPH: Hmph! [Slams her drink on the table and folds her arms. Cut to a shot of Zei.] \n",
      "ZEI: Of course, there's the matter of finding it. I've made several trips into the Si Wong Desert and almost died each time. [In a depressed voice.] I'm afraid that desert's impossible to cross. \n",
      "SOKKA: Professor, would you like to see our sky bison? \n",
      "ZEI: A sky bison?! You actually have one? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Appa retreating from four sandbenders, as he growls. \n",
      "ZEI: [Runs toward the sandbenders.] Sandbenders, shoo, away from the bison! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The sandbenders run away and get into two sand-sailers. They drive the sailers by creating a small tornado of sand near the sail. Cut to a ground view of Appa flying across the sky. Cut to Appa's saddle and pan from Katara and Toph leaning against the sides to Sokka who grabs a telescope and looks over the side. The shot changes to Momo, Zei, and Aang on Appa's head. Zei leans over Appa's head. \n",
      "ZEI: Tell me, sky bison, are you the last of your breed? [Appa growls and Zei responds enthusiastically.] Delightful! I only wish I spoke his tongue. [Scratches Appa's head.] Oh, the stories this beast could tell. [Momo crawls up to Zei's side and starts chittering.] Shush, chatty monkey. \n",
      "AANG: [Examines the picture of the library.] Wow, shouldn't be too hard to find a place like this out here. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa flies away from the camera. Cut back to the saddle. \n",
      "TOPH: [Groans in frustration.] Does this place even exist? \n",
      "ZEI: Some say it doesn't. \n",
      "TOPH: [Eyes widen in surprise before narrowing.] Shouldn't you have mentioned that before? [Collapses on the saddle, putting her feet over the side.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to an aerial view of Appa flying. Cut to Zei, who writes in his journal and pans to Toph. \n",
      "TOPH: [Pointing over the side of the saddle with excitement.] There it is! [Everybody on Appa looks to where Toph is pointing, but they can only see sand dunes. Aang, Katara, and Sokka glare at Toph in annoyance for tricking them. Cut back to the shot of Toph.] That's what it will sound like when one of you spots it. [Waves her hand in front of her face with a blank grin to remind them of the fact that she is blind. She quickly goes back to clutching the saddle.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Appa flying and shows a closer shot of Aang driving Appa while Momo sleeps on Aang's head. Sokka and Katara search for the library on Appa's saddle. \n",
      "KATARA: It shouldn't be this hard to spot a giant, ornate building from the air. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Looks through his telescope and spots a tower. Pointing.] Down there, what's that? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo wakes up. Cut to the tower and Appa flies down next to it. \n",
      "KATARA: [Holding the illustrations.] Forget it. It's obviously not what we're looking for. [Side shot.] The building in this drawing is enormous. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They see a sparkle in the distance and a fox holding a scroll with its mouth walking over a dune. \n",
      "SOKKA: [To Zei.] What kind of animal is that? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The fox runs up the tower. Shot changes to a window at the top of the tower through which the fox enters. \n",
      "ZEI: I think that was one of the Knowledge Seekers. [Frontal shot.] Oh, we must be close to the library! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Looking at the illustration Katara is holding.] No, this is the library- look! [Camera pans down from the tower to the illustration.] It's completely buried. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a zoom out shot of the spire from far away. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Further shot of the top of library. The camera pans up from the sand to the top of the library. \n",
      "ZEI: [Shouting dramatically.] The library is buried?! [Cut to a shot of the group standing in front of the spire. Zei runs forward. Depressed.] My life's ambition is now full of sand. [Collapses. Smiling, he lifts his head and reveals a small shovel in hand. Excitedly.] Well, time to start excavating. [He attempts to unearth the library using the tiny shovel. Cut to a close-up of the spire's surface as Toph places her palm against it.] \n",
      "TOPH: [Cut a small part of the library which Toph puts her hand on.] Actually, that won't be necessary. The inside seems to be completely intact. [Aerial shot.] And it's huge. \n",
      "SOKKA: That fox thingy went in through a window. I say we climb up there and give it a look. \n",
      "TOPH: I say you guys go ahead without me. \n",
      "KATARA: You got something against libraries? \n",
      "TOPH: I've held books before. And I gotta tell you, they don't exactly do it for me. \n",
      "KATARA: [Sheepishly.] Oh, right. Sorry. \n",
      "TOPH: Let me know if they have something you can listen to. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the window at the top of the tower. A boomerang with a rope tied to it is thrown into the window. At the bottom of the tower, Sokka starts scaling the rope and the camera pans to Aang, Appa, and Toph. \n",
      "AANG: [To Appa.] Don't worry, buddy. I'm not making you go underground ever again. You can stay out here with Toph. [Walks off camera.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa makes a low, rumbling growl. \n",
      "TOPH: [Awkwardly.] What's up? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to overhead shot Katara, Sokka, Aang, and Zei scaling the rope inside the library. The shot changes to a closer view as Zei, Aang, Sokka, and Katara climb down and Momo flies down. The shot changes to show the library's ceiling dome. \n",
      "ZEI: Oh, it's breathtaking! [Shot changes to show Zei, Aang, and Sokka climb down the rope with owl arches in the background.] The spirit spared no expense in designing this place. [Pointing.] Look at those beautiful buttresses! [Cut to an above shot of Sokka, Aang, and Zei, who are hanging from the rope. Sokka and Aang giggle at the word.] What's funny? \n",
      "AANG: Nothing. We just like architecture. \n",
      "ZEI: [Cut back to a smiling Zei.] As do I. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They slide off the rope onto a bridge and Momo lands on Aang's shoulder. \n",
      "ZEI: My word! [Examines an owl mosaic above two pillars.] The exquisite mosaic handiwork of this tile-rendered avian symbol ... [Sokka, Katara, and Aang look at Zei quizzically.] Eh, nice owl. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They hear rustling noises. Sokka and Katara run behind a pillar. Aang grabs Zei and they hide behind another pillar. Wan Shi Tong, an owl spirit, walks over the bridge and examines the rope. Aang cranes his head around the pillar. \n",
      "WAN.SHI.TONG: [Turns his head around.] I know you're back there. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang gasps and hides again. \n",
      "ZEI: [Smiles and walks from behind the pillar and up to Wan Shi Tong.] Hello, I'm Professor Zei, head of anthropology at Ba Sing Se University. \n",
      "WAN.SHI.TONG: You should leave the way you came. [Looks to the side.] Unless you want to become a stuffed head of anthropology. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera pans to three stuffed animal heads on a pillar. Frontal shot of Zei, as he moans and clutches his neck. Katara, Sokka, and Aang walk out from behind their pillars and up to Wan Shi Tong. \n",
      "SOKKA: Are you the spirit who brought this library to the physical world? \n",
      "WAN.SHI.TONG: Indeed, I am Wan Shi Tong, \"He Who Knows Ten Thousand Things.\" And you are obviously humans, which, by the way, are no longer permitted in my study. \n",
      "AANG: What do you have against humans? \n",
      "WAN.SHI.TONG: Hm! Humans only bother learning things to get the edge on other humans. [Cut to Zhao, studying scrolls in the library. Voice-over.] Like that firebender who came to this place a few years ago, looking to destroy his enemy. [Scene changes to the present.] So ... [Leans toward a sweating Sokka.] who are you trying to destroy? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Cut to his reflection in Wan Shi Tong's eye.] What? No-no-no-no destroying. We're not into that. \n",
      "WAN.SHI.TONG: [Blinks.] Then why have you come here? \n",
      "SOKKA: Um ... knowledge for knowledge's sake? \n",
      "WAN.SHI.TONG: [Shot changes to him leaning toward Sokka.] If you're going to lie to an all-knowing spirit being, you should at least put some effort into it. \n",
      "SOKKA: I'm not lying, I'm here with the Avatar, [Grabs Aang and puts him into the shot.] and he's the bridge between our worlds. He'll vouch for me. [Nudges Aang.] \n",
      "AANG: Ow. [Frontal shot.] Uh, yeah, I'll vouch. We will not abuse the knowledge in your library, good spirit. [Side shot.] You have my word. [They bow to Wan Shi Tong.] \n",
      "WAN.SHI.TONG: Hmm, very well. I'll let you peruse my vast collection [Shot changes to Zei, Aang, Katara, and Sokka looking hopefully.] on one condition. [They look at the spirit a little worriedly. Further overhead shot.] To prove your worth as scholars, you have to contribute some worthwhile knowledge. \n",
      "ZEI: [Walks up to Wan Shi Tong holding a book and kneels down.] Please accept this tome as a donation to your library. \n",
      "WAN.SHI.TONG: [Frontal shot.] First edition, very nice. [Grabs the book with his wing.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Camera pans up to show her holding the waterbending scroll.] I have an authentic waterbending scroll. \n",
      "WAN.SHI.TONG: [Frontal shot.] Ooh, these illustrations are quite stylish. [Grabs the scroll.] \n",
      "AANG: [Cut to him.] Uh ... oh, I know! [Grabs his wanted poster out of his shirt and shows it to Wan Shi Tong.] Hah! \n",
      "WAN.SHI.TONG: I suppose that counts. [Takes the poster.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Side shot of him walking forward.] Oh, great spirit, [Frontal shot of him holding a piece of string.] check this out. [Ties the string into a butterfly knot and shows it to Wan Shi Tong.] Ta-da! [Aang, Katara, and Zei look at Sokka with uncertainty. Shot of Wan Shi Tong just looking at him in silence.] It's a special knot. That counts as knowledge! \n",
      "WAN.SHI.TONG: [Frontal shot.] You're not very bright, are you? [Sokka grunts as Wan Shi Tong takes the knot.] Enjoy the library. [Jumps off the bridge and flies down to lower levels of the library.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Team Avatar and Zei walk toward the library. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Narrows his eyes.] Bright enough to fool you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to an overhead view of the desert outside the library, where Appa and Toph rest in the shade. The shot changes to a closer view of Appa and Toph. \n",
      "TOPH: [To Appa.] So ... you like ... flying? [Appa purrs deeply and scratches his ear.] Of course, I'm more comfortable on the ground where I can see. Well, I don't see the way you do. I feel the vibrations in the ground with my feet. [Closer shot of the two. Toph picks up a handful of sand and lets it fall.] But this sand is so loose and shifty, it makes everything look fuzzy. [Appa makes a rumbling groan with a further shot.] Not that there's anything wrong with fuzzy. [Appa grunts.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a large room full of books and the camera pans down to show the Knowledge Seeker, Team Avatar, and Zei at a bookshelf. In a closer shot, the Knowledge Seeker deposits its scroll on a shelf and the camera pans to the right to Team Avatar and Zei. Closer shot of Aang, as he flips a page on his book. He finds an illustration of a person talking to a lion turtle with two more lion turtles in the background. \n",
      "AANG: [Holds the illustration up to show Sokka and Katara.] Hey, look at these weird lion turtle things. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Pulls a book off the bookshelf with the symbols 子白 on the cover.] Eh, I've seen weirder. \n",
      "KATARA: [Walks up to Aang, carrying a book.] Aang, did you know in a past life, you were left-handed? \n",
      "AANG: I always knew I was special. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Sokka and Zei. While Zei takes books off of bookshelves and adds them to his stack, Sokka takes a scroll from a shelf, reads it, and puts it in his purse. Back shot of Sokka walking up to a podium. He sees the burnt piece of parchment framed on the podium with the characters 培治龍年七月九日烈火國最黑暗的一天. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Reading from the parchment.] \"The darkest day in Fire Nation history.\" It's got a date at the top, but it doesn't say anything else. [He looks around, making sure no one is watching, before prying open the frame with his sword and taking the parchment.] \n",
      "AANG: [Walks in with Katara and Zei.] Sokka, where are you going? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Running down a section of a library.] I want to know what happened to the Fire Nation on their darkest day. This could be promising. [Aang, Katara, and Zei follow him.] The information on the Fire Nation should be right up here. \n",
      "AANG: [Looking at a room full of ashes.] Firebenders. \n",
      "KATARA: They destroyed everything having to do with the Fire Nation. \n",
      "SOKKA: That's so unfair! Just when I think I'm one step ahead of the Fire Nation, it turns out they beat us here a long time ago. [Collapses on his knees.] I need to know what happened on the darkest day. [Hears whimpering and looks at the entrance to see the Knowledge Seeker standing on its hind legs.] Hello, little weird fox guy. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Knowledge Seeker gets on its four legs and points outside the room. \n",
      "ZEI: Seems it's trying to assist you. \n",
      "SOKKA: Um, sure, I guess I'll follow you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They follow the Knowledge Seeker to a large round door with a texture lining the bottom sides of the wall. The Knowledge Seeker enters a small door in the texture. The large door opens showing the Knowledge Seeker standing behind it. Team Avatar and Zei walk toward the center of the room. The Knowledge Seeker pushes a lever beside the calendar wheel and the domed ceiling changes from day to night. \n",
      "ZEI: This room is a true marvel, a mechanical wonder. It's a planetarium that shows the heavens moving. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The domed ceiling changes back into day. \n",
      "SOKKA: Uh, this is beautiful, but how is it helpful? \n",
      "KATARA: Maybe these dials represent dates and times. Sokka, try entering that date from that parchment you took. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Mock whispering.] Shh, Katara, not in front of the fox, he's with the owl. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Knowledge Seeker whimpers. Sokka glances at the parchment and changes four of the calendar wheels. He pushes the lever and the domed ceiling changes from day to night. \n",
      "AANG: Wow, I got to hand it to you, Sokka. You picked the best mini-vacation for sure. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The ceiling changes from night to day and the planetarium suddenly grows dark. \n",
      "KATARA: Hey, wait. What happened to the sun? \n",
      "AANG: [Narrows his eyes.] Great, you must have broken it. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Walks next to Aang.] It's not broken. [Shot changes to show the sun piece of the planetarium covered by the moon piece.] The sun is behind the moon. It's a solar eclipse! It's literally the darkest day in Fire Nation history. Now I get it. [Grabs Aang's shoulders and shakes him.] Something awful happened on that day. I don't know what, but I do know why. Firebenders lose their bending during a solar eclipse. [Pushes Aang back.] Sorry. \n",
      "KATARA: That makes sense. I mean, think what the lunar eclipse at the North Pole did to the waterbenders. This is huge. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Knowledge Seeker gets on its hind legs and begs. \n",
      "SOKKA: [To the Knowledge Seeker.] Fine, you earned it. [Tosses the fox a snack from his bag. To Aang and Katara.] We've gotta get this information to the Earth King at Ba Sing Se. We'll wait for the next eclipse, then we'll invade the Fire Nation when they're totally helpless. The Fire Lord is going down! \n",
      "WAN.SHI.TONG: [Enters the shot from behind Sokka.] Mortals are so predictable, and such terrible liars. [Sokka gulps. Shot changes to show Wan Shi Tong talking to them from the entrance.] You betrayed my trust. From the beginning, you intended to misuse this knowledge for evil purposes. \n",
      "SOKKA: You don't understand. If anyone's evil, it's the Fire Nation. You saw what they did to your library. They're destructive and dangerous. We need this information. \n",
      "WAN.SHI.TONG: You think you're the first person to believe their war was justified? Countless others before you have come here seeking weapons or weaknesses or battle strategies. \n",
      "AANG: We had no choice. Please, we're just desperate to protect the people we love. \n",
      "WAN.SHI.TONG: And now I'm going to protect what I love. [Flaps his wings and the library starts shaking.] \n",
      "AANG: What are you doing? \n",
      "WAN.SHI.TONG: I'm taking my knowledge back. No one will ever abuse it again. \n",
      "KATARA: [Sand pours from the ceiling.] He's sinking the building. We've gotta get out of here. \n",
      "WAN.SHI.TONG: I'm afraid I can't allow that. You already know too much. [Pecks at them, but misses.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Wan Shi Tong pursues them as they run out the planetarium. The camera pans up to the surface. Appa snarls as the library starts sinking and the ground starts shaking. \n",
      "TOPH: I already told you, I don't wanna snuggle. [Appa stands up and hurries away from the library. Toph looks at the sinking library.] Library sinking. [Running up to the library.] Library sinking! [Punches both fists into the library to stop it from sinking. Her feet slip in the sand, so she pauses to solidify it.] Hi-yah! [Struggles to stop it from sinking again.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera pans down to an aerial view of Team Avatar and Zei running through the library. They round a corner, and Wan Shi Tong continues pursuing them. \n",
      "ZEI: [Stops running and turns back toward Wan Shi Tong.] Great Knowledge Spirit, I beg you, do not destroy your vast collection of priceless tomes. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang uses air suction to move Zei out of Wan Shi Tong's attack. Aang fires an air blast at Wan Shi Tong, sending the spirit falling off the side of the bridge. \n",
      "AANG: [Runs back to Katara, Zei, and Sokka.] We've gotta get back to the surface! \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka, let's go. \n",
      "SOKKA: But we still don't know when the next eclipse is gonna to happen. \n",
      "KATARA: Don't be stupid! We'll find out later! \n",
      "SOKKA: No, we won't. If we leave this place, we'll never get the information. Aang, come with me to the planetarium, [Aang runs up to him.] I need cover. Katara, take Momo and get out of here! \n",
      "KATARA: But ...! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Wan Shi Tong breaks in between the two groups and pursues Katara and Zei. \n",
      "SOKKA: Go! \n",
      "KATARA: Hurry, Sokka! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka and Aang run away. Zei evades Wan Shi Tong by diving into a smaller aisle of books. He grabs a book, looking at the cover excitedly. Katara runs and Wan Shi Tong swoops down. Cut to the surface with Toph holding up the library. Appa grunts nervously. \n",
      "TOPH: What is it now? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to three sand-sailers. The camera pans across a sandbender's face and cuts to a side shot of the sailer. The sandbenders direct a sand blast at Appa. \n",
      "TOPH: [Struggling.] Who's there? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The sand-sailers circle Appa and a sandbender jumps out. Cut to inside the library, where Sokka and Aang run across a bridge and reach the entrance to the planetarium. \n",
      "AANG: Why are we doing this? \n",
      "SOKKA: Because if this calendar can tell us about eclipses in the past, then maybe it can project when the next one will be. \n",
      "AANG: You can't possibly check every single date. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Adjusting the calendar wheel.] I don't have to. We just need to check every date before Sozin's Comet arrives. Because after that- well, try not to think about that. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka finishes adjusting the wheels and Aang pushes the lever. The camera fades from the moon traveling across the ceiling to Sokka adjusting the wheel calendar, before switching to the ceiling changing from night to day. The camera fades to Aang looking at the night sky to the moon traveling across the ceiling, to the calendar wheel, to Sokka adjusting the wheel, to the sun and moon traveling close to each other, to Sokka trying again. \n",
      "AANG: [Pushing the lever.] Come on, eclipse. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the moon and sun traveling across the ceiling until the moon overlaps with the sun. \n",
      "SOKKA: That's it! The solar eclipse! It's just a few months away. [Takes out a piece of paper and writes down the date.] Got it. Now, let's get to Ba Sing Se. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They run out of the planetarium. Cut to Appa surrounded by sandbenders yielding weighted ropes. They throw the ropes over Appa and solidify the sand near their feet to bring Appa down. \n",
      "TOPH: Don't make me put this down. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph lets go of the library and earthbends a slice of sand at the sandbenders, but misses. She grabs the library again. Cut to a tied up Appa as the sand-sailers drag him away. \n",
      "TOPH: No! Stop sinking! [Fires three more slices of sand.] No! [Grabs the library.] I'm sorry, Appa. [Closes her eyes as the camera pans to show the sand-sailers dragging Appa away.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Katara running away from Wan Shi Tong. She stops beside a bookshelf, holding Momo. Wan Shi Tong walks on the other side of the bookshelf and spots Momo's tail. \n",
      "WAN.SHI.TONG: At least I'll have one specimen to add to my collection. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Wan Shi Tong tries to grab Momo with his beak, but Katara runs away with Momo. She reaches the bridge with the rope and turns back to face Wan Shi Tong. \n",
      "WAN.SHI.TONG: Your waterbending won't do you much good here. [Raises his head and unfolds his wings to attack.] I've studied Northern water style, Southern water style, even Foggy Swamp style. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a view of the ceiling. Aang flies his glider holding Sokka, who jumps off holding a book, yelling. Sokka slams the book onto Wan Shi Tong's head, knocking him out. \n",
      "SOKKA: That's called Sokka style. [Swings his fist to the side as he says this.] Learn it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Pan up to a shot of the hole in the ceiling where the rope is dangling. Light from the outside is pouring down. Cut to a shot from the side of Sokka, Katara, and Momo, and the defeated spirit lying unconscious on the bridge. More streams of sand pour in from above. Sokka and Katara climb over Wan Shi Tong and up the rope. Aang glides past them. Cut to a close shot of Sokka climbing the rope. He stops and looks back down. \n",
      "SOKKA: Wait! Professor, let's go. \n",
      "ZEI: [Sitting among a pile of books holding a scroll that surrounds him. The sand is building up and beginning to cover some of the stacks. Zei is reading a scroll. The camera slowly zooms in.] I'm not leaving. I can't. [Drops the parchment to his lap and raises his right fist.] I've spent too long trying to find this place. [Places his hand on his chest and looks up.] There's not another collection of knowledge like this on earth. [Cut to a close-up of Zei with his eyes closed. He opens his eyes while smiling and speaks wistfully.] I could spend an eternity in here. \n",
      "KATARA: [Cut to a shot of Sokka and Katara looking at the professor. Katara looks up at Sokka.] Just go! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Wan Shi Tong screeches and shakes the rope, making Sokka and Katara fall off. Aang catches them and they fly up while Wan Shi Tong pursues them. Cut to outside the library, where Aang, Sokka, and Katara land. Toph lets go of the library, falling back. Aerial shot showing the ground where the library used to be. \n",
      "SOKKA: We got it. There's a solar eclipse coming. [Jumps and hugs his sister.] The Fire Nation's in trouble now! \n",
      "AANG: [Stands up and walks toward Toph.] Where's Appa? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph shakes her head. Aang gasps and a tear falls down his cheek. The camera pans up from the crater to the sun. Fade to white, followed by the credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera shows a wide-view of the desert. Team Avatar looks in every direction over the vast ocean of sand for Appa. The camera halts as Aang and Toph come into view. Aang turns around to face Toph angrily. \n",
      "AANG: [Enraged.] How could you let them take Appa?! ‌ Why didn't you stop them‌?! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to close-up of Aang's angry face. \n",
      "TOPH: [Defensively.] I couldn't! The library was sinking! You guys were still inside and- \n",

      "AANG: [Still enraged.] You could've come to get us. I could've saved him! \n",
      "TOPH: [Turns to face him slightly.] I can hardly feel any vibrations out here. The sandbenders snuck up on me and there wasn't time for – \n",
      "AANG: [Snaps at Toph in a harsh way.] You just didn't care! You never liked Appa! You wanted him gone! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang looks extremely furious at Toph as Katara walks over to him. She puts her hand on his shoulder to try and calm him down. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, stop it. You know Toph did all she could. She saved our lives. \n",

      "AANG: That's all any of you guys care about, yourselves! You don't care whether Appa is okay or not! \n",
      "KATARA: We're all concerned, but we can't afford to be fighting now. \n",
      "AANG: [In a cold, hard tone.] I'm going after Appa. \n",

      "KATARA: Aang, wait! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a view from the sky, showing Aang flying away from the rest of the group who stand by the large crater created by the disappeared library. Cut back to Katara, who is still looking in the direction Aang took off. \n",
      "KATARA: We'd better start walking. We're the only people who know about the solar eclipse. We have to get that information to Ba Sing Se. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The group starts walking in the same direction as Aang took off to, with Katara leading the way, followed by Sokka. Toph closes the ranks. \n",
      "SOKKA: You think if we dig out the giant owl, he'll give us a ride? \n",

      "IROH: No please, don't stop just for me! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Switch to a front view of Zuko and Iroh. Iroh theatrically lets out several more groans of pain. Zuko pull at the reins, annoyed by the performance displayed by his uncle. As they dismount, the ostrich horse is alarmed by something. Zuko immediately takes on a firebending form, ready to defend himself. \n",
      "IROH: [Annoyed.] What now? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Rough Rhinos ride through the thicket at both sides of the road Zuko and Iroh were traveling on. Mongke's rhino steps the ground forcefully breaking the surface. Mongke is shown, pulling back the reigns. Zuko keeps up his defensive position, looking at the men that surrounded them. Iroh's face clears up as he stands up and places a hand on Zuko's shoulder. \n",
      "IROH: Colonel Mongke! What a pleasant surprise! \n",
      "MONGKE: If you're surprised we're here, then the Dragon of the West has lost a few steps. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Rough Rhinos prepare themselves for battle, each readying their own weapon of expertise. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Surprised.] You know these guys? \n",
      "IROH: Sure. Colonel Mongke and the Rough Rhinos are legendary. Each one is a different kind of weapon specialist. [The camera cuts to each member of the Rough Rhinos.] They are also a very capable singing group. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Mongke, who has his fist raised, ready for firebending. \n",
      "MONGKE: We're not here to give a concert. We're here to apprehend fugitives! \n",

      "MONGKE: Enough stalling! Round 'em up! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Camera shows an overhead view of the situation. Cut to a dark skinned, pony tailed guy that swings his ball and chain at Iroh, who kicks it away. The chain wraps itself around the leg of a nearby standing Rhino. Iroh tumbles over the ground, dodging two fire blasts. He rises back up and hits the Rhino in the rear, making it dash away, yanking the dark skinned warrior off his rhino and dragging him along. Iroh waves goodbye as he watches them go.\n",
      "The archer shoots a lit arrow at Zuko. He quickly reacts by knocking the arrow away and releasing a fire blast, burning a hole in the surprised archer's bow.\n",
      "Mongke joins the fight by directing some fire blasts at Iroh. Iroh deflects each and every one of them. As Mongke is busy with Iroh, Zuko runs up and jumps on the back of the Rhino. With two spinning fire kicks, he sends Colonel Mongke flying.\n",
      "Iroh runs up to the ostrich horse, jumps on and rides toward Zuko, who awaits him, standing on the Rhino of Colonel Mongke. As he jumps on, another Rough Rhino immediately starts the pursuit. The Rider throws a grenade at the fleeing ostrich horse. It explodes right in front of it, but Iroh and Zuko ride through the explosion's smoke. \n",
      "IROH: It's nice to see old friends. \n",
      "ZUKO: Too bad you don't have any old friends that don't want to attack you. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara bends three small blobs of water out of her pouch and into the mouths of Sokka, Toph and Momo. Sokka circulates the water in his mouth before swallowing it. \n",
      "SOKKA: [As he points to his mouth.] We're drinking your bending water. [He tries to define the taste of the water, smacking his lips. Disgustedly he exclaims.] You used this on the swamp guy! Urch! \n",
      "TOPH: It does taste swampy. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo lets out a sad cry in protest of the water's flavor, after also smacking his lips. Katara sadly puts the cork back on her water sack. \n",
      "KATARA: [Sad tone.] I'm sorry, it's all we have. \n",
      "SOKKA: Not anymore! Look! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara looks in the direction Sokka's pointing. He walks over to the cactus and cuts off a piece with his machete. He happily drinks the fluid that's inside while Momo crawls over to him. \n",
      "KATARA: [Worried.] Sokka, wait! You shouldn't be eating strange plants! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She drags Toph along on her arm as she runs toward Sokka. He and Momo are quenching their thirst with plenty of cactus juice. He cuts open another part of the cactus, excitedly offering its content to a skeptic looking Katara. \n",
      "SOKKA: There's water trapped inside these! \n",
      "KATARA: [Backing away from Sokka and the cactus.] I don't know ... \n",
      "SOKKA: [While cactus juice drips off his chin.] Suit yourself. It's very thirst quenching though. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He gives Katara a big smile like a true salesman. Cut to close-up of his left eye as his pupil dilates rapidly. He tries to shake off the feeling by rapidly shaking his head. He starts to trip. \n",
      "SOKKA: [In a strange echoing voice.] Drink cactus juice. It'll quench ya! Nothing's quenchier. [He crawls over the ground as a caterpillar before jumping back to the front, pushing his face toward the camera with a big smile.] It's the quenchiest! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara gives Sokka a very weird look. She grabs his cactus juice and pours it away. \n",
      "KATARA: Okay, I think you've had enough. \n",
      "SOKKA: Who lit Toph on fire? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara wants to react on Sokka's comment, but is distracted by a sound in the sky. She looks up to see Momo flying around in circles, increasing his speed, before plummeting into the ground, head first. Katara picks up and cradles the unconscious animal. \n",
      "TOPH: Can I get some of that cactus? \n",
      "KATARA: [Wrapping her arm around Toph's shoulders.] I don't think that's a good idea. Come on, we need to find Aang. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara leads Toph away. Sokka stays behind, staring blankly at the sky. Katara retraces her steps and pulls Sokka along by his arms. Cut to an overview shot of the endless desert. \n",
      "SOKKA: [In awe.] How did we get out here in the middle of the ocean? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara sighs as the scene cuts to Aang flying over the desert in search of Appa. He blows his bison whistle. \n",
      "AANG: Appa! [He glides down and lands on a dune.] Appa! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera circles around Aang. While he stares across the horizon, it begins to dawn on him that he is not going to find his friend out here. The tears well up in his eyes. \n",
      "AANG: No ... [Yelling.] No! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Overcome by anger, he slams his staff on the ground, creating a large mushroom-shaped cloud of sand. Dust that was kicked up by Aang's blow washes over Katara, Sokka and Toph as they climb over another dune. \n",
      "KATARA: What is that? \n",
      "TOPH: What? What is what? \n",
      "SOKKA: It's a giant mushroom! [Very excited.] Maybe it's friendly! \n",
      "KATARA: Let's just keep moving. I hope Aang's okay ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As Katara leads Toph away, Sokka starts to worship the mushroom by waving his arms up and down, back and forth. \n",
      "SOKKA: Friendly mushroom! Mushy giant friend! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the village with the Misty Palms Oasis at the border of the desert. \n",
      "MAN: Yeah, a little barefoot blind girl and her friends passed through here a few days ago. \n",
      "YU: Did they give you any indication where they were headed‌? \n",
      "MAN: Maybe you could give me a little incentive‌? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The man makes the money sign with his fingers. \n",
      "XIN.FU: You suggesting I break your fingers‌? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The man quickly hides his hand behind his back and points with the other one toward the desert. \n",
      "MAN: They went in the desert! Too bad there's almost no chance they survived. \n",
      "XIN.FU: That's okay, 'cause she's wanted dead or alive. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The man quietly backs away from Xin Fu and Yu \n",
      "YU: No she's not! I'm certain her father wants her alive. \n",
      "XIN.FU: Hey, look ... Fire Nation wanted posters! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Yu follows Xin Fu's lead and examines the wanted posters. A poster of Zuko and Iroh is surrounded by posters of Aang, the Blue Spirit, Jeong Jeong and Chey. \n",
      "YU: So? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Xin Fu looks at Zuko and Iroh as they walk toward the tavern. \n",
      "XIN.FU: So, look who's here. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Katara, Toph and Sokka. It is nearly twilight and they are still walking in a single file through the desert. A shadow passes over their heads and Aang lands behind them, kicking up a small cloud of sand. As the sand clears, Aang is still down. \n",
      "KATARA: I'm sorry, Aang. I know it's hard for you right now but ... we need to focus on getting out of here. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She walks over to him and puts a hand on his shoulder to comfort him. He pulls away. \n",
      "AANG: [Hopelessly.] What's the difference? We won't survive without Appa. We all know it. \n",
      "KATARA: [Encouraging.] Come on, Aang. We can do this if we work together. Right Toph? \n",
      "TOPH: As far as I can feel, we're trapped in a giant bowl of sand pudding. I got nothin'. \n",
      "KATARA: [Hopeful.] Sokka? Any ideas how to find Ba Sing Se? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka and Momo lie side by side on their backs, arms and legs stretched out. Sokka smiles blissfully. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Pointing up at the sky.] Why don't we ask the circle birds? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara directs her gaze to the sky and sees four buzzard wasps circling above their heads. She looks at every other member in the team. Aang still sits down sulking and Toph staggers a bit. Sokka sniggers a bit while Momo lazily claws at the buzzard wasps. \n",
      "KATARA: [Grabs her head in annoyance.] Ugh ... We're getting out of this desert, and we're going to do it together! Aang, get up. Everybody, hold hands. We can do this. We have to. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She takes one more look at the buzzard wasps in the sky before pulling Aang along by his staff. Aang holds on to Toph's hand and she holds on to Sokka's in turn. A big grinning Sokka pulls Momo along by his tail, who lazily tries to fly in the other direction.\n",
      "The sun is setting as they all stagger up a large dune, with Katara still in the lead. \n",
      "KATARA: I think we should stop for the night. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The rest of the group sighs and falls down of exhaustion. \n",
      "TOPH: Is there any more water? \n",
      "KATARA: This is the last of it. Everyone can have a little drink. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka crawls toward Katara with Momo riding on his back when she begins to bend the water out of her pouch. Momo leaps forward at the water, causing it to fall in the sand. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Theatrically panics, grabbing his head in despair.] Momo, no! You've killed us all! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara calmly holds her hand over the moist spot of sand and begins to bend the water back into her pouch, before giving it to Toph to drink. \n",
      "KATARA: No, he hasn't. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Relieved.] Oh, right. Bending. \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka, let me see the things you got from the library. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He immediately backs away and defensively grabs his back full of scrolls. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Offended.] What?! I didn't steal anything! Who told you that? [Pointing an accusing finger at Momo.] It was you! You ratted me out! \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka, I was there. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara takes the bag from Sokka and start to examine the scrolls. \n",
      "AANG: [Sadly.] It doesn't matter. None of those will tell us where Appa is. \n",
      "KATARA: No, but we can find out which way Ba Sing Se is. We can use the stars to guide us. [She pulls out a map of the stars.] That way we can travel at night when it's cool and rest during the day. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She turns around and sighs at the sight of the rest of the group. They are all lying there, exhausted from the long walk and their grief for the loss of Appa. \n",
      "KATARA: Just try to get some sleep. We'll start again in a few hours. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to Zuko and Iroh sitting at a table in the tavern at the Misty Palms Oasis. \n",
      "ZUKO: No one here is going to help us. These people just look like filthy wanderers. \n",
      "IROH: So do we. [Pointing at something behind Zuko.] Ah, this is interesting. I think I found our friend. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As Zuko turns around to see where Iroh is pointing at, the camera pans over his shoulder to reveal an old man sitting at a Pai Sho table. \n",
      "ZUKO: You brought us here to gamble on Pai Sho? \n",
      "IROH: I don't think this is a gamble. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko and Iroh walk toward the Pai Sho table. The camera zooms toward Xin Fu and Yu, who are sitting on a bench at the other side of the tavern. Xin Fu jumps up with the intention to grab them, but Yu places a hand on his shoulder to restrain him. \n",
      "XIN.FU: Let's take them now! \n",
      "YU: This place is full of desperate characters. If they find out we're collecting a bounty, we might have to fight them all just to keep our prize. Patience. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Iroh and Zuko approaching the Pai Sho table. \n",
      "IROH: May I have this game? \n",
      "FUNG: [Gesturing Iroh to sit down.] The guest has the first move. [Iroh places the lotus tile in the center of the board.] I see you favor the white lotus gambit. Not many still cling to the ancient ways. [He cups his hands toward Iroh.] \n",
      "IROH: Those who do can always find a friend. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He copies the gesture of the old man, also cupping his hands toward him. \n",
      "FUNG: Then let us play. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The old man places a tile on the board, quickly followed by a tile placed by Iroh. Seemingly without even looking at what the other person is doing, the two man quickly place their tiles on the board. Zuko sits down and watches intently as the two man place one tile after the other. When they are done, their tiles form the shape of a lotus flower. \n",
      "FUNG: Welcome, brother. The White Lotus opens wide to those who know her secrets. \n",
      "ZUKO: What are you old gasbags talking about? \n",
      "IROH: I always tried to tell you that Pai Sho is more than just a game. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Iroh rolls a tile over his knuckles and clutches it.\n",
      "Cut to a shot of Xin Fu and Yu. Xin Fu ran out of patience and jumps up. \n",
      "XIN.FU: I'm not waiting all night for these geezers to finish yapping! [He walks over to the Pai Sho table, followed by Yu.] It's over! You two fugitives are coming with me! \n",
      "FUNG: [Quickly places himself before Iroh and Zuko, preventing Xin Fu and Yu from reaching them.] I knew it! You two are wanted criminals with a giant bounty on your heads! \n",
      "ZUKO: I thought you said he would help! \n",
      "IROH: [Places a hand on Zuko's shoulder to reassure him.] He is. Just watch. \n",
      "FUNG: [To Yu and Xin Fu.] You think you're going to capture them and collect all that gold? \n",
      "MAN.IN.THE.BAR: Gold? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Every person in the bar looks up when they hear the word 'gold'. Some of them stand up, pulling a knife, ready to attack. \n",
      "YU: Uh ... Maybe we shouldn't. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Camera shows a close-up of a grinning Xin Fu. As he moves toward Zuko and Iroh, two men jump in front of him to block his path. With a reverse roundhouse kick, the earthbender bends a rock from the ground and easily pushes them out of his way.\n",
      "Yu readies himself for battle. He sinks the first person to charge him into the ground. Meanwhile Xin Fu kicks two sandbenders away while he is lifting another one up in the air and holding a fourth one back with his other hand. After he kicks another sandbender away, he twists his waist, sending the two men he is holding flying. One of them crashes into the wall behind the bar.\n",
      "When there is no one left to fight, Xin Fu and Yu realize that their prey has escaped during the chaos. Xin Fu growls in frustration and slams his two fists on the ground, erecting a giant pillar of earth under a downed sandbender, shooting him out of the window and against a palm tree.\n",
      "Cut to a scorpion walking over a rock. The camera shows how Momo is patting the sand he used to cover up Sokka while he is sleeping. He jumps away as Katara approaches Sokka to wake him up. \n",
      "KATARA: Come on, get up. We need to go. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka drowsily sits up and smiles like a drunken idiot. Toph also erects herself, smacking her lips. \n",
      "TOPH: Yesterday my mouth tasted like mud. Now it just tastes like sand. I never thought I'd miss the taste of mud so much. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara goes to Aang to wake him up, but he interrupts her before she can touch him. \n",
      "AANG: I'm awake. I couldn't sleep. \n",
      "KATARA: Well, we need to get moving if we want to get out of this sand pit. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang and Katara spot something large in the sky. He quickly sits up. Cut to a shot of a large, bison shaped object floating by the bright, full moon. Aang's expression brightens up in an instant. \n",
      "AANG: [Joyfully.] Appa! \n",
      "SOKKA: Appa‌? But why would Princess Yue need him‌? She's the moon! [Grabs Momo's tail, using it to rub his cheek.] She flies by herself! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A closer shot of the floating object reveals that it is just a small desert cloud. \n",
      "KATARA: [Sadly.] It's just a cloud. Wait! A cloud! [Offers he pouch to Aang.] Here, fly up and bend the water from that cloud into my pouch. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang gives Katara an angry look before snatching the offered water pouch out of her hands. The group gazes at him as he quickly passes two times over the cloud. The few remains of the cloud evaporate. He throws the pouch at Katara when he lands and she peeks in. \n",
      "KATARA: [Disappointed.] Wow ... there's hardly any in here. \n",
      "AANG: [Lashes out.] I'm sorry, okay! It's a desert cloud; I did all I could! What's anyone else doing?! [Pointing his staff at Katara.] What are you doing‌?! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She returns his attack with a shocked look on her face. \n",
      "KATARA: Trying to keep everyone together. Let's just get moving. We need to head this direction. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara looks at her charts once more and leads the group in the chosen direction. They are walking silently through the desert, until Toph trips and falls flat on her face. Aang and Katara are looking at Toph, while Sokka and Momo just stand there, staring blankly to the sky. Toph sits up and rubs her right foot. \n",
      "TOPH: Ow! Crud! I am so sick of not feeling where I'm going! [Pointing toward the little rocklike shaped object she tripped over.] And what idiot buried a boat in the middle of the desert‌? \n",
      "KATARA: A boat‌? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara runs over to inspect the object. \n",
      "TOPH: Believe me, I kicked it hard enough to feel plenty of vibrations. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka turns around, swinging like a string puppet, to see what Katara is so excited about. Katara begins to rub of the sand of the object that appears to be made of wood. Aang steps forward, suggestively holding up his staff. As soon as Katara backs away, Aang swings his staff around, creating a mighty gust of wind, revealing a boat of some sort. Katara crawls aboard and examines it. \n",
      "KATARA: It's one of the gliders the sandbenders use! And look! It's got some kind of compass on it! [Tapping the compass.] I bet it can point us out of here! Aang, you can bend a breeze so we can sail it. We're going to make it! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Shot of Sokka laughing childishly while burying Momo in the sand.\n",
      "Cut to a shot of a small village at the edge of the desert, where Zuko and Iroh follow the Pai Sho player into a flower shop. \n",
      "FUNG: It is an honor to welcome such a high-ranking member of the Order of the White Lotus. Being a Grand Master, you must know so many secrets. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Annoyed.] Now that you played Pai Sho, are you going to do some flower arranging, or is someone in this club going to offer some real help‌? \n",
      "IROH: You must forgive my nephew. He is not an initiate and has little appreciation for the cryptic arts. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Pai Sho player leads Iroh toward a door with a peephole in it. He knocks two times. A man slides open the small window in the door and peeks through. \n",
      "FLORIST: Who knocks at the guarded gate‌? \n",
      "IROH: One who has eaten the fruit and tasted its mysteries. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Iroh smiles as the door opens to let him and the Pai Sho player through. When Zuko attempts to follow them, the door slams shut in front of him. He looks at the door with a pout when Iroh opens the small window. \n",
      "IROH: I'm afraid it's members only. Wait out here. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: An annoyed Zuko frowns and crosses his arms as he rests against a nearby table. He leans over to sniff the plant on the table.\n",
      "Switch to a shot of the desert where the sand-sailer is making great speed. Katara navigates it through the desert, while Aang's driving it forward using strong gusts of wind. \n",
      "KATARA: The needle on this compass doesn't seem to be pointing north according to my charts. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara places her charts over the compass. Sokka sits beside her, dangling his legs over the edge and holding Momo by the tail, who glides in the opposite direction. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Dreamily.] Take it easy little lady. I'm sure the sand folks who built this baby know how to get around here. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara looks annoyed at Sokka. When she focuses her attention back toward the horizon in front of her, she gasps is comprehension when she sees a giant rock in the distance. \n",
      "KATARA: That's what the compass is pointing to! That giant rock! It must be the magnetic center of the desert. \n",
      "TOPH: [Ecstatic.] A rock‌?! Yes! Let's go! \n",
      "KATARA: [Hopeful.] Maybe we can find some water there! \n",
      "AANG: [Darkly.] Maybe we can find some sandbenders. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang continues to send gusts of wind into the sails of the glider, directing it toward the rock. Switch to a shot of the glider at the base of the rock. The sun's already rising when team Avatar reaches the top. \n",
      "TOPH: Ahhh ... Finally! Solid ground! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph happily lets herself drop flat on her back, moving her arms and legs back and forth, creating a rock angel. After she is done, the group starts to explore the caves that decorate the top of the rock. They enter a round tunnel. The cave's surface is covered with a yellow, gooey substance. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Breathes deeply.] I think my head is starting to clear out the cactus juice. And look! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka dips his hand in the yellow goo and tastes it, sharing his find with Momo. They both spit it out and Sokka makes a disgusted gagging noise. \n",
      "SOKKA: Tastes like rotten penguin meat! Awww, I feel woozy. \n",
      "KATARA: [Irritated.] You've been hallucinating on cactus juice all day and then you just lick something you find stuck to the wall of a cave‌?! \n",
      "SOKKA: I have a natural curiosity. \n",
      "TOPH: I don't think this is a normal cave. This was carved by something. \n",
      "AANG: Yeah ... look at the shape. \n",
      "TOPH: [Close-up of her feet.] There's something buzzing in here. [Camera pans up to her.] Something that's coming for us! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera shows how the group runs out of the cave, back into the open. Toph and Aang scream as the first buzzard wasp emerges. Aang pulls Toph down as it flies over their heads. A second wasp dives directly toward the camera.\n",
      "Cut to a shot of the giant rock from a distance, followed by a shot of the hive as more buzzard wasps swarm out and surround the group. Aang blasts the first wasp to come near them away with a strong air current.\n",
      "A second wasp lands on a nearby rock. The moment it touches it, Toph turns around to send the wasp flying again, shooting up the rock from underneath it.\n",
      "Another buzzard wasp flies between Sokka and Toph. She hears it fly behind her so she lifts the rock beside her and throws it in the general direction of the sound. The giant rock is only inches apart from crushing Sokka. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Surprised.] What are you doing? That rock almost crushed me! \n",
      "TOPH: Sorry, I can't tell where they are in the air! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A loud buzzing signals the passing of another wasp. Sokka readies his machete and runs after it. \n",
      "SOKKA: I got this one. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He ferociously swings his weapon back and forth at the camera. \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka, there's nothing there! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera pans back. He lowers his machete, looking around in search for his imagined foe. \n",
      "SOKKA: I guess my head's not as clear as I thought. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a close-up of a crouched up Momo. In the background, Katara backs a few steps in Aang's direction. \n",
      "KATARA: We have to get out of here! I'm completely out of water to bend! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A buzzard wasp swoops in from the sky and snatches up a screeching Momo as it flies away from the hive and the benders. \n",
      "AANG: Momo! I'm not losing anyone else out here. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Full of anger, he takes off on his glider in hot pursuit of Momo and the wasp. Katara and Sokka watch him go. \n",
      "KATARA: Come on, we're going down. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They descend along a narrow ledge. Katara leads Toph by hand. \n",
      "KATARA: Toph, shoot a rock right there. Fire! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara places Toph in the right direction. Toph kicks up some rocks and shoots them forward. The incoming buzzard wasp is shot down, taking several blows to the head. Sokka cheers, swinging his machete in the air. \n",
      "SOKKA: Yeah! You got it! She got it, right‌? \n",
      "KATARA: Yes. Now let's move. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara leads Toph on as they start to run along the ledge.\n",
      "Shift to a close-up of Aang. He is still chasing the buzzard wasp that took Momo. A grave expression casts shadows on his face. He dives, emerging again straight underneath the wasp. As he turns, he directs a strong gust of wind at the wasp with a kick of his leg. The gust forces the wasp to release Momo out of its clutches. Momo tumbles down, but quickly regains control and begins to soar next to Aang. Aang looks from Momo toward the rising sun at the horizon. With an angry glare, he notices that the wasp is getting away. Aang glides down, flying close to the ground. Using the speed of his descent, he closes his glider and swings his staff down. A powerful wall of air splits the sand, racing toward the escaping wasp. The animal is hit in mid air, knocking it to the ground. With a dark glare, Aang just stares at the downed wasp before walking back in the direction of the giant rock. Momo follows him quickly, frightened by this merciless outburst of power.\n",
      "Cut back to a shot of the giant rock, where buzzard wasps circle around Sokka and the rest, who've reached the sand-sailer at the base by now. Katara looks over Toph's shoulder, acting as her eyes. \n",
      "KATARA: On your left! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph reacts immediately and shoots a rock at her left. The buzzard wasp takes the rock full in the chest, shrieking on impact before tumbling down.\n",
      "The camera pans out, showing many more wasps hovering in the air. Suddenly, gigantic pillars of sand rise from the ground and scare off the swarm. Katara, Sokka and Toph lower their arms they had lifted to shield their heads from the sand. As the wind blows the dust away, the camera pans to the left, revealing several sandbenders. Aang lands before Katara, Sokka and Toph, ready to face the sandbenders.\n",
      "Cut back to a shot of the flower shop in the desert village, where a sleeping Zuko is startled by the squeaking of the door. Iroh steps through as Zuko takes on a defensive stance. \n",
      "ZUKO: What's going on? Is the club meeting over‌? \n",
      "IROH: Everything is taken care of. We're heading to Ba Sing Se. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Iroh and Fung bow to each other in respect. \n",
      "ZUKO: Ba Sing Se? ‌Why would we go to the Earth Kingdom capital‌? \n",
      "FUNG: [Calmly.] The city is filled with refugees. No one will notice two more. \n",
      "IROH: We can hide in plain sight there. And it's the safest place in the world from the Fire Nation. Even I couldn't break through to the city. [Happily shrugs his shoulders.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A bell signals that someone has entered the shop. A young man approaches the group, holding up some papers. \n",
      "WHITE.LOTUS.MEMBER: I have the passports for our guests, but there are two men out on the street looking for them. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Xin Fu and Yu can be seen through a small window in the door of the flower shop. They are holding up a wanted poster that depicts Iroh and Zuko to man walking by. \n",
      "XIN.FU: You seen these guys‌? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Shift back to a shot of the base of the giant rock, where the leader of the sandbenders confronts Aang and the rest. \n",
      "SHA-MO: What are you doing in our land with a sandbender sailer? ‌ From the looks of it, you stole it from the Hami tribe. \n",
      "KATARA: We found the sailer abandoned in the desert. We're traveling with the Avatar. [She gestures at Aang. The leader's eyes widen a bit at this information.] Our bison was stolen and we have to get to Ba Sing Se. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A young man to the right of the leader takes a step forward and aggressively addresses Katara. \n",
      "GHASHIUN: You dare accuse our people of theft while you ride in on a stolen sand sailer‌?! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Close-up of Toph's misty, green eye, narrowing as she hears the young man's voice. \n",
      "SHA-MO: Quiet, Ghashiun. No one accused our people of anything. If what they say is true, we must give them hospitality. \n",
      "GHASHIUN: Sorry, father. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph's eye widens. \n",
      "TOPH: I recognize the son's voice. He's the one that stole Appa. \n",
      "KATARA: Are you sure?‌ \n",
      "TOPH: I never forget a voice. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang's tunic flutters around him as he charges forward, threateningly brandishing his staff toward Ghashiun. \n",
      "AANG: [Angry.] You stole Appa! Where is he? ‌What did you do to him? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Ghashiun cowers back. \n",
      "GHASHIUN: They're lying! They're the thieves! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: With an angry frown and a growl of frustration, Aang smacks his staff on the ground, obliterating one of the sandbender's sailers with a powerful blade of air. \n",
      "AANG: [Enraged.] Where is my bison‌? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes again to the flower shop, where a man exits the door, pulling two big flowerpots on a wooden wagon. After he leaves, Xin Fu and Yu walk toward the door. Xin Fu slams the door open with such ferocity that an overhanging plant comes crashing down. He shoves Zuko's and Iroh's wanted poster under the nose of the florist. \n",
      "XIN.FU: Hey you, where are these men‌? I got a tip that they're in your shop. \n",
      "FLORIST: [Calmly.] As you can see, no one is here but us. \n",
      "YU: We know all about your secret back room. [To Xin Fu.] Kick it down. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Xin Fu charges the door like a mad bull and knocks it down along with the surrounding wall, with one mighty kick. \n",
      "FLORIST: Hey! That room is for flowers only! \n",
      "YU: Some unlucky soul has an incomplete Pai Sho set. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Yu picks up a lotus tile that lies in the center of the room and shows it to Xin Fu, who angrily knocks it out of his hands. \n",
      "XIN.FU: Let's go back to finding the girl. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene switches to the man pulling the wooden wagon with the two large pots over some dunes. Zuko's and Iroh's head emerges from underneath the flowers. They briefly peek around before sinking back into their pots.\n",
      "Cut back to the desert where Aang is confronting the sandbenders. \n",
      "AANG: You tell me where he is now! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: To emphasize his order, Aang sends a strong blast of air toward another sailer. The sandbenders watch in shock as it blows up. \n",
      "SHA-MO:: [To Ghashiun.] What did you do‌? \n",
      "GHASHIUN: I-It wasn't me! \n",
      "TOPH: You said to put a muzzle on him! \n",
      "AANG: [Enraged.] You muzzled Appa‌? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang's eyes and tattoos start to glow as he enters the Avatar State. With a swing of his staff, he destroys the last of the sandbender's sailers. \n",
      "GHASHIUN: I'm sorry! I didn't know that it belonged to the Avatar! \n",
      "AANG: [With the voices of all the Avatars.] Tell me where Appa is! \n",
      "GHASHIUN: [Frightened.] I traded him! To some merchants! He's probably in Ba Sing Se by now! They were going to sell him there! [The sandbenders raise their hands as if to ward off the Avatar's bright, angry glare.] Please! We'll escort you out of the desert! We'll help however we can! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The wind around Avatar Aang starts the swirl, as his anger is reaching its peak. Sokka pull Toph along with him as he starts to make a break for it, running away from his enraged friend. \n",
      "SOKKA: Just get out of here! Run! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang drops his staff. The wind around him forms a fast moving sphere, knocking up sand high into the sky. As everyone runs away, Katara stays put, staring sadly at the ground. The sandstorm engulfs her and Aang completely, obscuring them from the sight of the others. They brace themselves as the whirlwind swoops over them.\n",
      "Aang's air sphere slowly lifts him up in the air, his teeth clenched and his hands cramped with rage. Katara grabs his right arm, preventing him from rising any further. The terrible face of an outraged Avatar looks down upon her, only to be met by Katara's sincere, sad expression. She pulls him back to the ground and presses him close against her chest. Sokka and Toph lower their arms as the wind becomes less violent. Tears are streaming down the Avatar's glowing eyes. Katara tries her best to hold on as her own tears well up. The air sphere slowly dissolves away as Aang leaves the Avatar state. His rage subsides to make room for pure, heartbreaking sadness.\n",
      "Fade to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The team is situated at the waterfall pond. Sokka is surveying a map. Toph is sitting with her feet in the water, moving it back and forth. Aang is swimming while Katara is located at the top of the lake near the waterfall. Aang goes underwater for a moment and bends an ice cube around himself for amusement. \n",
      "KATARA: [Excitedly.] Waterbending bomb! Yeah! [Jumps into the water.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The splash sends Aang out of the water, breaks his ice prison, and soaks Sokka, Toph, and the maps which he tried to protect. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sarcastically.] Sure, five thousand year-old maps from the spirit library. Just splash some water on 'em. \n",
      "KATARA: Sorry. [Wrings her hair dry and bends the water off the map.] \n",
      "AANG: So, did you figure out what route we're going to take? \n",
      "SOKKA: Okay, we just got out of the desert, so we must be around here. And we need to go to Ba Sing Se, which is here. It looks like the only passage connecting the south to the north is this sliver of land called the Serpent's Pass. \n",
      "TOPH: You sure that's the best way to go? \n",
      "SOKKA: It's the only way. I mean, it's not like we have Appa to fly us there. \n",
      "KATARA: [Quietly.] Shush up about Appa. Can't you at least try to be sensitive? \n",
      "AANG: Katara, it's okay. I know I was upset about losing Appa before, but I just want to focus on getting to Ba Sing Se and telling the Earth King about the solar eclipse. \n",
      "KATARA: [Surprised.] Oh ... well, okay. I'm glad you're doing better. \n",
      "SOKKA: Then to Ba Sing Se we go. No more distractions. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Suddenly, three refugees arrive. \n",
      "THAN: Hello there, fellow refugees! \n",
      "AANG: So, you guys are headed to Ba Sing Se, too? \n",
      "THAN: Sure are. We're trying to get there before my wife Ying has her baby. \n",
      "KATARA: Great! We can travel through the Serpent's Pass together. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The three refugees look up in shock. \n",
      "YING: The Serpent's Pass? Only the truly desperate take that deadly route! \n",
      "TOPH: Deadly route. [Punches Sokka in the arm.] Great pick, Sokka! \n",
      "SOKKA: Well, we are desperate. \n",
      "THAN: You should come with us to Full Moon Bay. Ferries take refugees across the lake. It's the fastest way to Ba Sing Se. \n",
      "YING: And it's hidden, so the Fire Nation can't find it. \n",
      "KATARA: Hmm ... peaceful ferry ride or deadly pass? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: At Full Moon Bay. \n",
      "KATARA: I can't believe how many people's lives have been uprooted by the Fire Nation. \n",
      "THAN: We're all looking for a better life, safe behind the walls of Ba Sing Se. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A ferry departs. Zuko and Iroh are on board. \n",
      "IROH: Who would have thought after all these years, I'd return to the scene of my greatest military disgrace ... [Turns away for a second before turning back with a floral hat on his head.] as a tourist! \n",
      "ZUKO: Look around. We're not tourists, we're refugees. [Sips food and spits it out.] Ugh! I'm sick of eating rotten food, sleeping in the dirt. I'm tired of living like this! \n",
      "JET: Aren't we all? My name's Jet and these are my Freedom Fighters, Smellerbee and Longshot. \n",
      "SMELLERBEE: Hey. [Longshot nods.] \n",
      "ZUKO: Hello. \n",
      "JET: Here's the deal. I hear the captain's eating like a king while the refugees have to feed off his scraps. Doesn't seem fair, does it? \n",
      "IROH: What sort of king is he eating like? \n",
      "JET: The fat, happy kind. [At this, Iroh's mouth hangs open as he starts to drool.] You want to help us \"liberate\" some food? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Tosses the bowl of rotten food into the water.] I'm in. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Jet smirks. \n",
      "Back at the station. \n",
      "TICKET.LADY: I told you already ... no vegetables on the ferry! One cabbage slug could destroy the entire ecosystem of Ba Sing Se! Security! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A platypus bear destroys the cabbage cart. \n",
      "CABBAGE.MERCHANT: Ahhh! My cabbages! [He is carried away.] \n",
      "TICKET.LADY: Next! \n",
      "AANG: Um, four tickets for the ferry to Ba Sing Se, please. \n",
      "TICKET.LADY: Passports? \n",
      "AANG: Uh ... no one told us we had to have passports. \n",
      "SOKKA: Don't you know who this is? He's the Avatar! \n",
      "TICKET.LADY: Ah, I see fifty Avatars a day and, by the way, not a very impressive costume. [The screen pans to show several impostors; notices Momo.] Besides, no animals allowed. Do I need to call security? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The platypus bear chomps down on the cabbage. Momo hides in fear. \n",
      "AANG: That won't be necessary. \n",
      "TICKET.LADY: Next! \n",
      "TOPH: I'll take care of this. My name is Toph Beifong, and I'll need four tickets. [Presents her passport.] \n",
      "TICKET.LADY: Ah, the golden seal of the flying boar! It is my pleasure to help anyone of the Beifong family. \n",
      "TOPH: It is your pleasure. As you can see, I am blind and these three imbeciles are my valets. [Sweeps her arm behind her, presenting her friends to the hesitant clerk.] \n",
      "TICKET.LADY: But, the animal- \n",
      "TOPH: -is my seeing-eye lemur. \n",
      "TICKET.LADY: Well, normally it's only one ticket per passport, but this document is so official ... I guess it's worth four tickets. [Stamps an approval seal on the tickets.] \n",
      "TOPH: Thank you very much. \n",
      "SOKKA: All right, we scammed that lady good! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Suddenly, a security guard, actually Suki without makeup, grabs Sokka. \n",
      "SUKI: Tickets and passports please. \n",
      "SOKKA: Is there a problem? \n",
      "SUKI: Yeah, I got a problem with you! I've seen your type before. Probably sarcastic, think you're hilarious and let me guess, you're traveling with the Avatar. \n",
      "SOKKA: Do I know you? \n",
      "SUKI: You mean you don't remember? Maybe you'll remember this! [Kisses Sokka on the cheek.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Suki! [Embraces her.] \n",
      "SUKI: Sokka, it's good to see you! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Later, in a different location of the station. The gang and Suki talk. \n",
      "KATARA: You look so different without your makeup! And the new outfit. \n",
      "SUKI: That crabby lady makes all the security guards wear them. And look at you, sleeveless guy. Been working out? \n",
      "SOKKA: Ahhh, I'll grab a tree branch and do a few chin touches every now and then. Nothing major. \n",
      "AANG: Are the other Kyoshi Warriors around? \n",
      "SUKI: Yeah. After you left Kyoshi, we wanted to find a way to help people. We ended up escorting some refugees and we've been here ever since. [Momo jumps up next to her.] Hi, Momo! Good to see you too! [Scratches his head near his ear.] So why are you guys getting tickets for the ferry? Wouldn't you just fly across on Appa? \n",
      "KATARA: Appa is missing. We hope to find him in Ba Sing Se. \n",
      "SUKI: I'm so sorry to hear that. [To Aang.] Are you doing okay? \n",
      "AANG: I'm doing fine. Would everybody stop worrying about me? \n",
      "YING: Avatar Aang, you have to help us! Someone took all of our belongings; our passports, our tickets, everything's gone! \n",
      "AANG: I'll talk to the lady for you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back at the desk. \n",
      "TICKET.LADY: No passports, no tickets! [Stamps a \"denied\" stamp on Aang's forehead.] \n",
      "AANG: But she's pregnant and all of her stuff was stolen! You have to make an exception! \n",
      "TICKET.LADY: No exceptions! If I just gave away tickets willy-nilly to anyone, there would be no more order! You know what that means, no more civilization! \n",
      "AANG: What if we gave them our tickets? \n",
      "TICKET.LADY: No! \n",
      "AANG: But ... \n",
      "TICKET.LADY: Next! \n",
      "AANG: Don't worry, you'll get to the city safely. I'll lead you through the Serpent's Pass. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Moments later. \n",
      "SOKKA: I can't believe we gave up our tickets and now we're going through the Serpent's Pass. \n",
      "TOPH: I can't believe you're still complaining about it. \n",
      "SUKI: [In her normal Kyoshi Warrior attire.] I'm coming too! \n",
      "SOKKA: Are you sure that's a good idea? \n",
      "SUKI: Sokka, I thought you'd want me to come. \n",
      "SOKKA: I do, it's just– \n",
      "SUKI: Just what? \n",
      "SOKKA: Nothing. I'm glad you're coming. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Outside, at the pass. \n",
      "SOKKA: This is the Serpent's Pass? I thought it would be a little more wind-y, you know, like a serpent. Huh, I guess they misnamed it. \n",
      "YING: Look at this writing! How awful! \n",
      "TOPH: What does it say? \n",
      "KATARA: It says, \"abandon hope\". \n",
      "YING: How can we abandon hope? It's all we have! \n",
      "AANG: I don't know. The monks used to say that hope was just a distraction, so maybe we do need to abandon it. \n",
      "KATARA: What are you talking about? \n",
      "AANG: Hope is not going to get us into Ba Sing Se and it's not going to help find Appa. We need to focus on what we're doing right now and that's getting across this path. \n",
      "KATARA: Okay, if you say so. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Within the pass. \n",
      "SUKI: The Fire Nation controls the western lake. Rumor has it they're working on something big on the other side of it and don't want anyone to find out what it is. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They all pass by a sailing Fire Nation ship. A part of the rock gives out, causing Than to fall. Toph stops it from falling and lifts him back up with earthbending. \n",
      "THAN: I'm okay! [The rock falls to the water, which the Fire Nation ship notices. It fires.] \n",
      "SOKKA: They've spotted us! Let's go, let's go! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang gets on his glider and deflects the fireball back. Another fireball hits the mountain, causing several pieces of rock over Suki to fall. Sokka pushes her out of the way. Toph bends out a part of the mountain to keep the rocks from falling on Sokka. \n",
      "SOKKA: Suki, are you okay? You have to be more careful! Come on! \n",
      "TOPH: [Pretending to be Sokka.] \"Thanks for saving my life, Toph.\" Hey, no problem, Sokka. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Hours later, at sunset, the travelers set up their camp. Sokka approaches Suki. \n",
      "SOKKA: Suki, you shouldn't sleep there. Who knows how stable this ledge is, it could give away at any moment! [Moves her sleeping bag.] \n",
      "SUKI: Sokka, I'm fine, stop worrying! \n",
      "SOKKA: You're right, you're right, you're perfectly capable of taking care of yourself! Wait! Oh, never mind, I thought I saw a spider, but, you're fine. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back on the ferry. Zuko, Jet, and Smellerbee sneak up to the food storage area. Jet breaks the door open with his twin tiger hook swords, and he and Zuko take some food. \n",
      "SMELLERBEE: Guard's coming! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Longshot fires an arrow with a rope attached to it, allowing the three to slide down it. Longshot pulls it away before the guard notices. Back at the pass, Aang is standing at the edge of the rock, looking out at the ocean, blankly. Katara approaches him. \n",
      "KATARA: You know, it's okay to miss Appa. [Aang remains silent.] What's going on with you? In the desert, all you cared about was finding Appa and now it's like you don't care about him at all. \n",
      "AANG: You saw what I did out there. I was so angry about losing Appa that I couldn't control myself. I hated feeling like that. \n",
      "KATARA: But now you're not letting yourself feel anything. I know sometimes it hurts more to hope and it hurts more to care. But you have to promise me that you won't stop caring. [ Holds out her arms.] Come on, you need a hug. \n",
      "AANG: [Bows before her.] Thank you for your concern, Katara. [Exits.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara shows visible concern.\n",
      "In another part of the Pass, Sokka stands by himself, until Suki approaches. \n",
      "SUKI: It's a beautiful moon. \n",
      "SOKKA: Yeah, it really is. \n",
      "SUKI: Look, I know you're just trying to help, but I can take care of myself. \n",
      "SOKKA: I know you can. \n",
      "SUKI: Then why are you acting so overprotective? \n",
      "SOKKA: It's so hard to lose someone you care about. Something happened at the North Pole and I couldn't protect someone. I don't want anything like that to ever happen again. \n",
      "SUKI: I lost someone I care about. He didn't die, he just went away. I only had a few days to get to know him, but he was smart and brave and funny ... \n",
      "SOKKA: [Jealous.] Who is this guy? Is he taller than me? \n",
      "SUKI: No, he's about your height. \n",
      "SOKKA: Is he better-looking? \n",
      "SUKI: It is you, stupid! \n",
      "SOKKA: Oh! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two prepare to kiss, but Sokka pulls back at the last moment. \n",
      "SOKKA: I can't. \n",
      "SUKI: I'm sorry. \n",
      "SOKKA: No, you shouldn't be. [Exits.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back on the ferry. Jet passes out food to other travelers. The other Freedom Fighters, Zuko, and Iroh sit together. \n",
      "IROH: So, Smellerbee. That's an unusual name for a young man. \n",
      "SMELLERBEE: Maybe it's because I'm not a man ... I'm a girl! [Walks away.] \n",
      "IROH: [Calling out to her.] Oh, now I see. It's a beautiful name for a lovely girl! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Longshot approaches Smellerbee and gestures at her. \n",
      "SMELLERBEE: I know, you're right. As long as I'm confident with who I am, it doesn't matter what other people think. Thanks, Longshot. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Longshot nods at her. Jet approaches Zuko and Iroh. \n",
      "JET: From what I heard, people eat like this every night in Ba Sing Se. I can't wait to set my eyes on that giant wall. \n",
      "IROH: It is a magnificent site. \n",
      "JET: So you've been there before? \n",
      "IROH: Once. When I was a ... different man. \n",
      "JET: I've done some things in my past that I'm not proud of, but that's why I'm going to Ba Sing Se: for a new beginning. A second chance. \n",
      "IROH: That's very noble of you. I believe people can change their lives if they want to. I believe in second chances. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back at the Serpent's Pass. The travelers notice that a section of the pass is below the sea level, and not able to be navigated. \n",
      "KATARA: Everyone single file! [She divides the water, allowing everyone to walk through the drowned out path.] Aang, I need help! [Aang helps by creating an air bubble.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo's curiosity is aroused by the fish. He dives in the water, only to return back when he sees a large shadow. The rest of them notice. \n",
      "KATARA: What is that thing? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The shadow breaks through the water, breaking the divide. Toph quickly uses her earthbending to raise the ground they are standing on above the water. The shadow is actually a large serpent, which appears from the water with a shriek. \n",
      "SOKKA: I think I just figured out why they call it the Serpent's Pass! Suki, you know about giant sea monsters, make it go away! \n",
      "SUKI: Just because I live near the unagi doesn't mean I'm an expert! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Holds up Momo.] Oh great and powerful sea serpent, please accept this humble and tasty offering. Thank you. \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka! \n",
      "AANG: [Blasts the Serpent back with a burst of air.] I'll distract it. Katara, get everyone across! [Takes off on his glider.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara freezes the water to create an ice trail. Everyone except for Toph crosses. Katara tries to ice up the serpent, but it fails. \n",
      "SOKKA: Toph, come on, it's just ice! \n",
      "TOPH: [Feels the ice but her sense of sight is restricted.] Actually, I'm going to stay on my little island, where I can see! [The serpent takes out half the island.] Okay, I'm coming! [Slowly crosses the ice.] \n",
      "SOKKA: You're doing great! Just follow the sound of my voice! \n",
      "TOPH: It's hard to ignore. \n",
      "SOKKA: You're almost there! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The serpent slams down the ice trail, dropping Toph into a struggle to stay above water. \n",
      "TOPH: Help! I can't swim! \n",
      "SOKKA: I'm coming, Toph! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Before he can do anything, Suki jumps in for the save. \n",
      "TOPH: Help! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph falls below the water, but Suki pulls her up before she drowns. \n",
      "TOPH: [Thinking it is Sokka.] Oh Sokka, you saved me! [Kisses Suki on the cheek.] \n",
      "SUKI: Actually, it's me. \n",
      "TOPH: Oh ... well ... [Chuckles. Embarrassed.] you can go ahead and let me drown now. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Meanwhile, the serpent is caught in a whirlpool created by Aang and Katara. The force of it slams the serpent into the mountain, causing it to fall back below water. Upon seeing the two return, the rest of the travelers cheer. Moments later, near Ba Sing Se's wall. \n",
      "SOKKA: There's the wall! Now it's nothing but smooth sailing to Ba Sing Se. \n",
      "YING: [Groans in pain.] Oh no! \n",
      "SOKKA: What's wrong? \n",
      "YING: The baby's coming! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Panicked.] What? Now? Can't you hold it in or something? \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka, calm down. I helped Gran-Gran deliver lots of babies back home. \n",
      "SOKKA: This isn't the same as delivering an arctic seal! This is a real ... human ... thing! \n",
      "KATARA: It's called a baby and I helped her deliver plenty of those, too. Aang, get some rags. Sokka, water. Toph, I need you to make an earth tent, a big one. [Toph earthbends the rock to form a tent.] Suki, come with me. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back on the ferry. Jet approaches Zuko. \n",
      "JET: You know, as soon as I saw your scar, I knew exactly who you were. You're an outcast, like me. And us outcasts have to stick together. We have to watch each other's backs. Because no one else will. \n",
      "ZUKO: I've realized lately that being on your own isn't always the best path. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The ferry closes in on the walls. \n",
      "Back at the pass. Ying is breathing heavily as the baby delivery continues. \n",
      "KATARA: You're doing great, Ying. Sokka, where's that water? Now get ready to push. One ... two ... [Sokka enters.] ... three, push! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Ying groans; Sokka passes out. Moments later, the baby arrives and begins to cry. Aang, Toph, and Sokka are all outside the tent. \n",
      "KATARA: [From inside the tent.] It's a girl! \n",
      "TOPH: So, you want to go see the baby, or are you going to faint like an old lady again? \n",
      "SOKKA: No, no, I'm good this time. [Toph and Sokka enter the tent.] \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, you have to come see this. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang enters to see the new life. \n",
      "TOPH: She sounds healthy. \n",
      "KATARA: She's beautiful. \n",
      "SOKKA: It's so ... squishy looking. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang begins to smile. \n",
      "THAN: What should we name her? \n",
      "YING: I want our daughter's name to be unique. I want it to mean something. \n",
      "AANG: [Sheds some tears.] I've been going through a really hard time lately. But you've made me ... hopeful again. \n",
      "YING: I know what I want to name our baby now. Hope. \n",
      "THAN: That's a perfect name. Hope. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Outside the tent. Aang meets with Katara. Suki, Sokka, and Toph stand next to the tent. \n",
      "AANG: I thought I was trying to be strong. But really I was just running away from my feelings. Seeing this family together, so full of happiness and love, it's reminded me how I feel about Appa ... and how I feel about you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara sheds some tears. Aang and Katara embrace, Katara's eyes still watering. The other three approach. \n",
      "AANG: I promise, I'll find Appa as fast as I can. I just really need to do this. \n",
      "SOKKA: See you in the big city. \n",
      "TOPH: Say hi to that big fuzzball for me. [Punches Aang in the arm.] \n",
      "KATARA: You'll find him, Aang. \n",
      "AANG: I know. Thank you, Katara. You ready, Momo? [Aang and Momo fly off. The rest wave goodbye.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Suki approaches Sokka. \n",
      "SUKI: Sokka, it's been really great to see you again. \n",
      "SOKKA: Whoa, hold on. Why does it sound like you're saying goodbye? \n",
      "SUKI: I came along because I wanted to make sure you got through the Serpent's Pass safely. But now I need to get back to the other Kyoshi Warriors. \n",
      "SOKKA: So you came along to protect me? \n",
      "SUKI: Listen, I'm really sorry about last night. We were talking ... and saying things ... and I just got carried away and before I knew it - \n",
      "SOKKA: [Kisses Suki.] You talk too much. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two share a deep kiss. Aang and Momo fly to the top of the Outer Wall of Ba Sing Se. However, Aang quickly notices a large drill with a Fire Nation insignia, heading for the wall. \n",
      "AANG: Sorry Momo, Appa's going to have to wait. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens where several Fire Nation tanks rumble across the terrain, a large metal mechanism following close behind. The camera zooms out to a shot of the Fire Nation drill slowly moving its way toward the Outer Wall of Ba Sing Se. Several sections of the drill extend forward, releasing steam as spikes are driven into the ground. The drill's command module ascends where inside are Princess Azula, her friends, Mai and Ty Lee, War Minister Qin and several operators of the drill. \n",
      "QIN: This drill is a feat of scientific ingenuity and raw destructive power. Once it tunnels through the wall, our troops will storm their city. The Earth Kingdom will finally fall, and you can claim Ba Sing Se in the name of your father. Nothing can stop us. \n",
      "TY.LEE: [Looking through the telescope.] Hmmm, what about those muscle-y guys down there? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She peers through a periscope at several Earth Kingdom troops using earthbending to create large trenches, Fire Nation forces following them in hot pursuit. \n",
      "QIN: [Strikes the periscope roughly alarming Ty Lee.] Please. The drill's metal shell is impervious to any earthbending attack. \n",
      "AZULA: Oh, I'm sure it is, War Minister Qin, but just to be on the safe side ... [Sharply while looking at the two girls.] Mai and Ty Lee, take the earthbenders out! \n",
      "MAI: [Swinging a knife around her finger; relieved.] Finally, something to do. [Rises and walks out.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to where Katara, Sokka and Toph are escorting Than and his family to the city. Aang appears, flying in on his glider with Momo behind him. He lands, Momo perched on his shoulder. \n",
      "KATARA: [Surprised.] Aang, what are you doing here? I thought you were looking for Appa. \n",
      "AANG: I was, but something stopped me. Something big. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene switches to the base of the Outer Wall where Aang and Toph use earthbending to transport everyone up the wall. \n",
      "SOKKA: Now what's so big that Appa has to wait? \n",
      "AANG: [Camera zooms out to drill.] That. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The group arrives at the top of the Outer Wall. \n",
      "YING: [Despairingly.] We made it to Ba Sing Se and we're still not safe. No one is! [Huddles with family members.] \n",
      "EARTHBENDER.GUARD: What are you people doing here? Civilians aren't allowed on the wall! \n",
      "AANG: I'm the Avatar. Take me to whoever is in charge. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to a portion of the Outer Wall where a roof rises overhead, supported by tall arches. An Earth Kingdom general sits behind a desk. \n",
      "GENERAL.SUNG: [Happily.] It is an honor to welcome you to the Outer Wall, young Avatar, but your help is not needed. \n",
      "AANG: Not needed? \n",
      "GENERAL.SUNG: [Calmly.] Not needed. I have the situation under control. I assure you the Fire Nation cannot penetrate this wall. Many have tried to break through it, but none have succeeded. \n",
      "TOPH: What about the Dragon of the West? He got in. \n",
      "GENERAL.SUNG: [Slightly taken aback.] Well ... uh, technically yes, but he was quickly expunged. [Confidently.] Nevertheless, that is why the city is named Ba Sing Se. It's the \"impenetrable city\". They don't call it Na Sing Se. [Laughs, but subsequently turns serious.] That means \"penetrable city.\" \n",
      "TOPH: Yeah, thanks for the tour, but we still got the drill problem. \n",
      "GENERAL.SUNG: Not for long. To stop it, I've sent an elite platoon of earthbenders called the Terra Team. \n",
      "SOKKA: That's a good group name. Very catchy. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to where the Terra Team is launching their assault on the Fire Nation drill. They manage to overthrow one tank and get closer to the drill. \n",
      "TERRA.TEAM.LEADER: Ready ... attack! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The earthbenders wedge large earth spikes into the metal shell of the drill to halt it. However, the drill's segments separate, reducing the columns to crumbles. The Terra Team narrowly manages to conjure earth shields to defend themselves against an assault of flying daggers hurled by Mai. She and Ty Lee are seen sliding down the shell of the drill. The scene cuts to the side of the drill where Ty Lee lands gracefully onto the ground. She effortlessly manages to defeat the earthbenders through an acrobatic display, utilizing chi blocking. \n",
      "GENERAL.SUNG: [Upon witnessing the defeat of the Terra Team.] We're doomed! [Flails arms in panic.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Slaps him across the face.] Get a hold of yourself, man! \n",
      "GENERAL.SUNG: [Rubbing cheek.] You're right. I'm sorry. \n",
      "TOPH: Maybe you'd like the Avatar's help now? \n",
      "GENERAL.SUNG: [Meekly stands before the Avatar. Humbly.] Yes, please. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to where Aang and the rest are overlooking the wall at the drill. \n",
      "AANG: The question is, how are we going to stop that thing? [All turn their heads to Sokka.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Why are you all looking at me? \n",
      "AANG: You're the idea guy. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Complaining.] So I'm the only one who can ever come up with a plan? That's a lot of pressure. \n",
      "KATARA: And also the complaining guy. \n",
      "SOKKA: That part I don't mind. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to where a ticket woman is inspecting Zuko and Iroh's tickets. \n",
      "TICKET.WOMAN: So, Mr. Lee and Mr. ummm ... Mushy, is it? \n",
      "IROH: It's pronounced Mushi. \n",
      "TICKET.WOMAN: [Annoyed.] You telling me how to do my job? \n",
      "IROH: [Approaches the ticket booth.] Uh, no, no. But may I just say you're like a flower in bloom. Your beauty is intoxicating. \n",
      "TICKET.WOMAN: [Flirtatiously.] You're pretty easy on the eyes yourself, handsome. Raorr! Welcome to Ba Sing Se. [Stamps their tickets.] \n",
      "ZUKO: [Disgusted.] I'm going to forget I saw that. [Grabs ticket and walks away.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Camera changes to view of Jet, overlooking Zuko, now under the adopted alias, Lee. \n",
      "JET: I think Lee would make a good Freedom Fighter. He's just trying to find his way in the world, like us. \n",
      "SMELLERBEE: You don't know anything about him, Jet. \n",
      "JET: I know he didn't get that scar from a waterbender. \n",
      "SMELLERBEE: Besides, I thought we were going straight now. \n",
      "JET: We are, and the new Freedom Fighters could use a guy like Lee. What do you think, Longshot? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Longshot looks over at him silently with a meaningful look on his face and blinks his eyes. \n",
      "JET: I can respect that. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Meanwhile, back at the Outer Wall, Katara attempts to heal a member of the Terra Team. \n",
      "GENERAL.SUNG: What's wrong with him? He doesn't look injured. \n",
      "KATARA: His chi is blocked. [Stops healing.] Who did this to you? \n",
      "TERRA.TEAM.MEMBER: Two girls ambushed us. One of them hit me with a bunch of quick jabs and suddenly I couldn't earthbend anymore and I could barely move. Then she cartwheeled away. \n",
      "KATARA: [Eyes widen in realization.] Ty Lee. She doesn't look dangerous, but she knows the human body and its weak points. It's like she takes you down from the inside. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Excitedly.] Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! Ooh! \n",
      "KATARA: Yes? \n",
      "SOKKA: What you just said! That's how we're going to take down the drill! The same way Ty Lee took down all those big earthbenders! \n",
      "TOPH: By hitting its pressure points! \n",
      "AANG: [Looking out over the wall with a determined look.] We'll take it down from the inside. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to the Fire Nation drill. The camera pans to where Aang, Katara, Sokka and Toph are crouching together in one of the abandoned trenches of the Terra Team. \n",
      "TOPH: [Gesturing toward the drill.] Once I whip up some cover, you're not going to be able to see. So, stay close to me. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She steps outside the trench and with a powerful stomp of her foot, sending a mass of flying debris clouding toward the drill. \n",
      "TOPH: Run! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The group races into the dust cloud behind Toph. The scene cuts to the command module where Ty Lee is peering at the cloud through the periscope. \n",
      "TY.LEE: Hey, look at that dust cloud. [Periscope view shows front of drill and billowing cloud.] It's so ... poofy. [Cut back to Ty Lee who looks away from the periscope with a spaced-out expression.] Poof. \n",
      "QIN: Don't worry, Princess. I'm sure it's nothing. [Azula casts a doubtful look.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to outside where the group is standing in the midst of the dust beside the drill. Toph earthbends a hole into the ground. \n",
      "TOPH: Everyone into the hole! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She and the others jump into the hole and the ground above them closes shut. The camera pans to underground where it is pitch black. \n",
      "SOKKA: It's so dark down here, I can't see a thing! \n",
      "TOPH: [Sarcastically.] Oh no, what a nightmare! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sheepishly.] Sorry. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They make their way to the surface underneath the drill, where Sokka spots an opening. \n",
      "SOKKA: There! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang leaps up to the bar hanging from the opening and, dangling upside-down from his legs, hoists Sokka and Katara into the drill. He realizes Toph is not following them. Sokka sticks his head out of the drill. \n",
      "SOKKA: Toph, come on! \n",
      "TOPH: No way am I going in that metal monster. I can't bend in there. I'll try to slow it down out here. \n",
      "SOKKA: Okay, good luck! [He and Aang disappear into the drill.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph earthbends a wedge of rock into the drill, however, it is proving to be a difficult task as it pushes her back. The scene changes to inside the drill where Sokka is leading the others through a tunnel of valves and pipes. \n",
      "SOKKA: I need a plan of this machine. Some schematics that show what the inside looks like. Then we can find its weak points. \n",
      "AANG: Where are we going to get something like that? [Sokka unexpectedly cuts off a steam valve with his machete.] What are you doing? Someone's going to hear us! \n",
      "SOKKA: That's the point. I figure a machine this big needs engineers to run it. And when something breaks ... \n",
      "KATARA: They come to fix it! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang and Katara smile at each other. Moments later, an engineer wearing a mask is seen walking down the misty hallway to the site of the damage. \n",
      "KATARA: [Appears behind him.] Hi. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She freezes the mist, covering the engineer in a thin layer of ice. Sokka runs up to the frozen engineer and takes his schematics. \n",
      "SOKKA: This'll work. Thanks! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The trio runs off, leaving the helpless engineer who drops his spear unintentionally. The scene changes to where Sokka and the others are studying the plans. \n",
      "SOKKA: It looks like the drill is made up of two main structures. There's the inner mechanism where we are now and the outer shell. The inner part and the outer part are connected by these braces. If we cut through them, the entire thing will collapse. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang and Katara nod in agreement. The scene changes to the train station where Zuko, Iroh and the three Freedom Fighters are awaiting their train. The camera focuses on Zuko and Iroh, who sit in the waiting area. Jet approaches and sits next to Zuko. \n",
      "JET: So, you guys got plans once you're inside the city? \n",
      "TEA.SELLER: Get your hot tea here! Finest tea in Ba Sing Se! \n",
      "IROH: [Waves hand.] Ooh! Jasmine please. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The tea seller pours tea into a leaf cup for Iroh. Iroh sips the tea, but soon grimaces at its repulsive taste. \n",
      "IROH: Blaugh! Ugh, coldest tea in Ba Sing Se is more like it! What a disgrace! \n",
      "JET: Hey, can I talk to you for a second? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He motions for Zuko to follow him. Zuko sighs and reluctantly rises. The two walk several feet away from Iroh's spot. \n",
      "JET: You and I have a much better chance of making it in the city if we stick together. You want to join the Freedom Fighters? \n",
      "ZUKO: Thanks, but I don't think you want me in your gang. \n",
      "JET: Come on, we made a great team looting that captain's food. Think of all the good we could do for these refugees. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Walking away.] I said no. \n",
      "JET: Have it your way. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He catches sight of Iroh, who is sipping his now steaming hot tea, causing his eyes to widen in shock and realization. Zuko, approaching Iroh, glances over his shoulder at Jet, who narrows his eyes and walks away. Angrily, he knocks the tea cup out of Iroh's hand. \n",
      "IROH: Hey! \n",
      "ZUKO: [Gritting in a whisper.] What are you doing firebending your tea? For a wise, old man, that was a pretty stupid move! \n",
      "IROH: [Mourning.] I know you're not supposed to cry over spilled tea, but ... [Sniffs. The cup is shown overturned in a puddle.] it's just so sad! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene switches to the interior of the drill where Sokka is leading the others through a door onto a massive steal beam. \n",
      "SOKKA: Wow, it looks a lot thicker in person than it does in the plans. We're going to have to work pretty hard to cut through that. \n",
      "KATARA: [Crosses her arms.] What's this \"we\" stuff? Aang and I are going to have to do all the work. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Turns and gestures to self.] Look, I'm the plan guy. You two [Makes rapid chop-chop gestures.] are the cut stuff up with waterbending guys. [Strikes a heroic pose.] Together, we're Team Avatar! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara and Aang shoot each other awkward looks. The scene cuts to one where the two are positioned on either side of one brace. Using waterbending, they slice through the metal sharply. The shot changes to when the brace is sliced halfway through. Both Katara and Aang are bent over and gasping in exhaustion. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Pumping arms in the air.] C'mon team. Don't quit now. [Katara grinds her teeth as she seethes with rage.] We're ... \n",
      "KATARA: [Explodes with frustration.] Grrr! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara shoots a menacing glare while pulling out her water whip and threatening to strike him with it. Cut to Sokka, who stands wide-eyed, arms still in air. \n",
      "SOKKA: I mean, [Recovers and points reassuringly.] you're almost there. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two resume work slicing the brace. With every lash of the water whip, the cut through the brace enlarges and Sokka grows more and more eager. At last, a cut is made clean through the brace, however, to their disappointment, the brace budges mere inches from its position. \n",
      "KATARA: [Panting in exhaustion.] At this rate, we won't do enough damage before the drill reaches the wall. \n",
      "AANG: I don't know how many more of those I have in me. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The drill suddenly creaks. \n",
      "SOKKA: Do you hear that? We took it down! We better get out of here fast! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The trio run for the door, only to halt upon hearing an announcement being made through overhead speaking tubes. \n",
      "QIN: Congratulations, crew. The drill has made contact with the wall of Ba Sing Se. [Cuts to him standing in the command module.] Start the countdown to victory! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cheers erupt from the crew. The camera cuts to Azula, a threatening look of determination on her face. Aang, Katara and Sokka look at each other in shock and dismay. The camera cuts to a scene of the drill hammering through the wall, sending loose boulders in every direction. The scene changes to one of a stream of a saturated rock and water solution traveling through tubes and making its way through the back entrance of the drill. Cuts to Sokka, who is desperately attempting to move the brace. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Pushing against brace.] C'mon brace ... budge! [Makes several more attempts to move it.] \n",
      "KATARA: This is bad, really bad. \n",
      "SOKKA: We're putting everything we've got into busting these braces, but it's taking too long! \n",
      "AANG: [Struck with realization.] Maybe we don't need to cut all the way through. Toph has been teaching me that you shouldn't give one hundred percent of your energy into any one strike. [Rises.] Sokka, take a fighting stance. You've got to be quick and accurate. Hit a series of points and break your opponent's stance. [Strikes Sokka several times.] And when he's reeling back, you deliver the final blow. [Hits him softly on the head.] His own weight becomes his downfall, literally. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As Aang is speaking, Sokka kneels over. \n",
      "KATARA: So we just need to weaken the braces, instead of cutting all the way through. \n",
      "AANG: Then I'll go to the top of this thing and deliver the final blow. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Rising.] And boom! It all comes crashing down! \n",
      "AANG: Everyone inside that wall. The whole world is counting on us. \n",
      "SOKKA: The whole world minus the Fire Nation that is. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka grins, while the other two simply stare at each other exasperated. The scene cuts to Toph under the drill, putting all her strength into keeping the rock column stable as she is slowly pushed back by the force of the drill. \n",
      "TOPH: [Straining as the drill continues to push her back.] C'mon, Twinkle Toes, hurry up! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to where Aang and Katara are making rapid progress, slicing through several braces halfway to weaken them. \n",
      "AANG: That's enough! We need to get to the next one! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to outside the drill, where earthbenders are sending boulders down at the drill from the wall. The scene changes to the command module where the War Minister receives shocking news from engineers communicating through speaking tubes. \n",
      "ENGINEER: War Minister, an engineer was ambushed! His schematics were stolen! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Qin is clearly surprised while Azula narrows her eyes in suspicion. \n",
      "SECOND.ENGINEER: War Minister, a brace on the starboard side has been cut clean through! It's sabotage, sir! \n",
      "AZULA: [Sharply.] Let's go, ladies! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to where the trio continues to slice through the braces. \n",
      "SOKKA: Good work, Team Avatar! Now Aang just needs to ... [Glances up in horror.] duck! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He ducks just in time to evade the blue fire blast sent his way by Azula, who runs out and stands on another brace followed by her friends. \n",
      "AANG: [Barely misses another fire blast.] Whoa! \n",
      "TY.LEE: Wow, Azula, you were right! It is the Avatar! [Cut to a close-up of Ty Lee; she smiles flirtatiously at Sokka.] ... and friends. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Smiles and waves.] Hey. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara approaches her brother and drags him away, clearly annoyed. Ty Lee swings herself forward toward Aang who quickly airbends her away. The trio escape the scene and race through the drill's hallways. They come to an intersection. \n",
      "AANG: Guys, get out of here. I know what I need to do. \n",
      "KATARA: Wait. [Throws him her water skin.] You need this water more than I do! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang catches the water skin and starts running again. Azula and her team reach the intersection. \n",
      "AZULA: Follow them! The Avatar's mine! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Mai and Ty Lee begin chasing Katara and Sokka while Azula chases after Aang. Meanwhile, the two siblings have arrived at the end of the hallway where there is a closed hatch. \n",
      "KATARA: [Reads a sign nearby, while Sokka struggles to open the hatch.] Slurry pipeline? What does that mean? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Having successfully opened hatch which leads to a canal channeling slurry.] It's rock and water mixed together. It means our way out! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two begin descending into the pipe when Mai and Ty Lee arrive. They manage to escape into the canal just as a flurry of daggers is sent their way. The camera cuts to a shot of them floating through the slurry. Mai and Ty Lee run over and peer into the pipeline. \n",
      "MAI: [Holds her hands over the slurry.] Ugh, disgusting! \n",
      "TY.LEE: C'mon! You heard Azula. We have to follow them! \n",
      "MAI: She can shoot all the lightning she wants at me. I am not going in that wall sludge juice. [Shivers in disgust.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Ty Lee shrugs and leaps through the pipeline into the slurry. Mai shudders with a final expression of disgust and closes the hatch. The scene cuts to where Aang races past several engineers through the drill. The camera cuts to the rear of the drill where a flood of slurry is continually being released. Katara and Sokka slide through the slurry onto the ground with Ty Lee following them in hot pursuit. Katara uses waterbending to stop the flow of slurry and plug up the back entrance of the drill, thus trapping Ty Lee. \n",
      "KATARA: [Hatefully and tauntingly.] Why don't you try blocking my chi now, circus freak? \n",
      "SOKKA: Katara, keep that up. The pressure will build up in the drill. Then when Aang delivers the final blow, it'll be ready to pop! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to where Aang and Momo have made their way to the top of the drill. \n",
      "AANG: [Halting.] This looks like a good spot, Momo. [Looks up to find boulders being hurtled down the wall, nearly crushing him. Yelling.] General Sung, tell your soldiers to stop shooting rocks down here! \n",
      "GENERAL.SUNG: [Frantically.] Soldiers, whatever you do, don't stop shooting rocks down there! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The soldiers nod and launch another round of rocks toward the drill. Aang leaps out of the way of the oncoming boulders and begins slicing at the hull of the metal using water from Katara's water skin. The scene changes to where Katara continues to hold Ty Lee captive in the slurry. \n",
      "SOKKA: Good technique, little sister! Keep it up! Don't forget to breathe! \n",
      "KATARA: [Irritated.] You know, I'm just about sick and tired of you telling me what to do all day! You're like a chattering hog-monkey! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Screaming.] Just bend the slurry, woman! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Frustrated, Katara bends a wave of slurry into her brother with her free hand, knocking him down into the foul muck. \n",
      "TOPH: [Approaching Katara.] You guys need some help? \n",
      "KATARA: Toph, help me plug up this drain. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two cooperate with each other to bend the slurry, sending Ty Lee farther into the drill and causing the pipes to begin to expand under the pressure. The scene cuts to where Aang continues to slice the metal of the drill. \n",
      "AANG: [Exhausted.] What I'd give to be a metalbender. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo suddenly shrieks and Aang deflects a blue fire blast just in time. \n",
      "AANG: [Assuming a fighting stance.] Momo, get out of here! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Azula appears before the Avatar and a battle ensues between the two. Azula shoots fire blasts at Aang, who manages to block them using airbending. She continues the fire attacks only to have each one of her strikes deterred by water whips. She eventually manages to vaporize the water, sending Aang back. The two narrowly dodge the several boulders that are hurtled toward them at that moment. Aang uses earthbending and airbending to send rocks at Azula, who manages to avoid them all. Azula sends another powerful firebending assault that slams Aang into the Outer Wall of Ba Sing Se, leaving him unconscious.\n",
      "The camera view briefly changes to where the front of the drill is seen having completely dug its way through the Outer Wall. Camera changes to Azula as she walks over to him with fire in her right hand, preparing to deal a deadly final strike, but Aang awakens and sends her skidding back using an earthbending gauntlet. A flood of slurry is released as the drill bores deeper into the wall, coating the two. Azula slides toward a helpless Aang, attempting to halt herself by windmilling only to collide with him. The force of the collision sends both sliding off opposite sides of the drill. Azula is able to stop her descent by grinding her feet into the drill's side while Momo drags Aang up to the top with the help of Aang's airbending. \n",
      "AANG: Thanks, Momo. I owe you one. [Runs over to the wedge he sliced in the drill.] Now all I need ... [A boulder falls before him.] Actually, that is what I need for once. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He uses airbending to position the boulder over the X mark in the drill. Using earthbending, he cuts the rock several times, creating a wedge that fits inside the middle of the hole. He begins sprinting toward the wall, scales up its side by riding an air scooter and, once he arrives at his highest point, rockets at lightning speed toward the bottom. As he propels himself downward, Azula catches sight of him and fires at him. She misses by mere seconds and is sent back forcefully as Aang leaps and slams down on the wedge, creating a large ripple effect. The impact of the blow causes the sliced braces inside the drill to collapse and the pipes to burst, releasing a torrent of slurry. Slurry begins to seep from the drill. The scene cuts to Katara and Toph, who remain in their bending stances. \n",
      "SOKKA: Woohoo! \n",
      "TOPH: Here it comes! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She earthbends Katara, Sokka, and herself onto a rock pillar to avoid the flood of slurry. Slurry gushes from the rear of the drill, and Ty Lee slams into the wall of the rock pillar as she is forcefully pushed forward by the flood. The drill begins to release steam and its segments begin to collapse. On the other side of the wall, the drill is seen coming to a halt.\n",
      "The camera zooms out on the destroyed drill. The scene cuts to Aang covered in slurry, Momo licking him as he wipes it away near his face, a huge smile spread across his face. Cut to War Minister Qin, who stares at the slurry from inside the command module, completely shocked. Cuts to General Sung atop the Outer Wall, covered in the muck. Cuts to Ty Lee as she attempts to clear away the mess. Cut to shot of Azula, skidding down the drill also covered in slurry. She lands by Ty Lee, causing the acrobat to be covered in slurry once again. A hatch opens, revealing Mai, who is completely clean. \n",
      "MAI: [Dryly.] We lost. \n",

      "SMELLERBEE: Jet, relax. So the old guy had some hot tea. Big deal. \n",
      "JET: He heated it himself! [Darkly.] Those guys are firebenders! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Iroh and Zuko board the train, Jet and his groups eying them. Iroh and Zuko seat themselves next to Than and his family. Iroh notices Hope. \n",
      "IROH: What a handsome baby. [Strokes the infant.] \n",
      "YING: Thank you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Camera closes up on Hope, who is sleeping. Scene cuts to outside where two earthbenders begin moving the train out of the station. Scene changes to Team Avatar standing at the top of the wall, overlooking the sunset. \n",
      "SOKKA: I just want to say, good effort out there today, Team Avatar! \n",
      "KATARA: [Unamused.] Enough with the Team Avatar stuff. No matter how many times you say it, it's not going to catch on. \n",
      "SOKKA: How about ... [Pulls out boomerang.] the Boomeraang Squad! See it's good because it's got \"Aang\" in it. Boomeraang. \n",
      "AANG: [Grins.] I kind of like that one. \n",
      "KATARA: [Begins walking away.] Let's talk about this on our way into the city. \n",
      "SOKKA: The Aang Gang? \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka ... \n",
      "SOKKA: The Fearsome Foursome? \n",
      "TOPH: [Also walking away.] You're crazy. \n",
      "SOKKA: Why? We're fearsome! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He runs after them. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fades to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens to two fox antelopes, grazing on a hill side. They look up at the monorail tracks behind them as a monorail goes past, pushed by two earthbenders. Cut to inside the car where Aang, Katara, Sokka, Toph, and Momo are awaiting their arrival at Ba Sing Se. Katara looks out from the window and notices the Inner Wall of the Earth Kingdom capital drawing closer. \n",
      "KATARA: [Excitedly.] Look, the Inner Wall! [Cut to a shot of the monorail approaching the wall. Cut back inside monorail.] I can't believe we finally made it to Ba Sing Se in one piece. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Slightly skeptically.] Hey, don't jinx it! We can still be attacked by some giant exploding Fire Nation spoon. Or find out the city's been submerged in an ocean full of killer shrimp! \n",
      "TOPH: [Slightly annoyed, yet still jokingly.] You been hitting the cactus juice again? \n",
      "SOKKA: I'm just sayin', weird stuff happens to us. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A man, sucking a corn plant in his mouth, takes a seat between Toph and Sokka, startling them. The scene changes to Aang and Katara looking out the windows, the former closing his eyes sadly. \n",
      "KATARA: [Sympathetically.] Don't worry Aang, we'll find Appa. \n",
      "AANG: [Doubtfully.] It's such a big city. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Somewhat optimistically.] He's a giant bison! Where could someone possibly hide him? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene shows the monorail entering the Inner Wall. Cut to Sokka, Katara, and Aang viewing the giant city through the windows. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Realizing the city's gigantic size.] Oh. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The three notice that Ba Sing Se stretches almost as far as their eyes can see, and it has many roads and buildings. Their train enters the monorail station, stopping there. All of them disembark. \n",
      "TOPH: [Sighs.] Back in the city. Great. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Excitedly.] What's the problem? It's amazing! \n",
      "TOPH: [Shot shows Sokka and Toph with Momo resting on her shoulder.] It's just a bunch of walls and rules. You wait, you'll get sick of it in a couple of days. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to Aang looking at the bison whistle in his palm, and he blows it. \n",
      "AANG: I'm comin' for ya, buddy. [Katara walks over to the downtrodden Aang, and places her hand on his shoulder. More confidently.] He's here; I can feel it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The shot changes to the monorail departing, behind the team. Cut to the other side of the track, where there is a woman with long dark hair that billows in the wind. She approaches them with a strange smile on her face. \n",
      "JOO.DEE: [Excited.] Hello, my name is Joo Dee! I have been given the great honor of showing the Avatar around Ba Sing Se. And you must be Sokka, Katara, and Toph! Welcome to our wonderful city. Shall we get started? \n",
      "SOKKA: Yes. We have information about the Fire Nation army that we need to deliver to the Earth King, immediately. \n",
      "JOO.DEE: Great! Let's begin our tour. And then I'll show you to your new home here. I think you'll like it! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Slightly annoyed.] Ugh! [Walks up to Joo Dee.] Maybe you missed what I said. We need to talk to the king about the War, it's important. \n",
      "JOO.DEE: [Close-up on Joo Dee's face.] You're in Ba Sing Se now. Everyone is safe here. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Team Avatar has a confused look on their faces regarding Joo Dee's strange statement. Cut to an overhead shot of the area of the city near the wall.

      "JOO.DEE: This is the Lower Ring. \n",
      "KATARA: What's that wall for? \n",
      "JOO.DEE: Oh, Ba Sing Se has many walls! There are the ones outside protecting us, and the ones inside, that help maintain order. [Shot changes to outside the carriage as the camera pans across some refugees.] This is where our newest arrivals live, as well as our craftsman and artisans, people that work with their hands. [Shot changes back to inside the carriage.] It's so quaint and lively! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a shot of two men conversing in an alley. One of them is holding a large sword that glistens in the light. Both glare at the carriage as it passes. Cut back to the carriage, where Katara becomes unnerved, her face blanking out, while Momo, who was looking out of the window by hanging from the ceiling, quickly retreats completely into the carriage. \n",
      "JOO.DEE: [Nervously.] You do want to watch your step, though. \n",
      "KATARA: [Nervous look on her face.] Why do they have all these poor people blocked off in one part of the city? \n",
      "AANG: [Upset and somewhat bored.] This is why I never came here before. I always heard it was so different from the way the monks taught us to live. [Looks out the window.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to another part of the Lower Ring. Cut to Zuko walking down the street. Iroh catches up to him from behind, holding a large vase with several orange flowers placed in it. Cut to a close-up of Zuko staring coldly at the flora and Iroh. \n",
      "IROH: I just want our place to look nice, in case someone brings home a lady friend! [He gives Zuko a nudge with the elbow.] \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to overhead view of the street they are walking down. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Longshot and Smellerbee walk up to Jet from an alley. \n",
      "SMELLERBEE: Jet, you saw a man with a hot cup of tea. It doesn't prove he's a firebender. And what if he is, are we supposed to attack them‌? I thought we were starting over here, changing our ways. \n",
      "JET: We are. When I get the evidence I need, I'll report them to the police and let them handle it. [Walks forward a bit and turns his head to face the pair.] Ok‌ay? \n",

      "SOKKA: Yeah, we met a professor from the Ba Sing Se University. He took us to an ancient underground library where we discovered information about the war that is [Cut to inside carriage. Leaning toward Joo Dee, losing his patience.] absolutely crucial for the Earth King to hear! \n",
      "JOO.DEE: [Smiling; excitedly.] Isn't history fascinating? Look, here's one of the oldest buildings in the Middle Ring, Town Hall! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The carriage stops and Joo Dee exits. Sokka stares at her, annoyed. \n",
      "SOKKA: Is that woman deaf? She only seems to hear every other word I say. \n",
      "TOPH: It's called \"being handled\". Get used to it. [Crosses her arms as everyone else glares sadly at Sokka.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to a small tea shop in the Lower Ring, with Jet leaning against the shop's wall. He turns around and peeks inside the window, spotting Zuko and Iroh speaking with the shop's owner. Cut to Jet's view. \n",

      "IROH: [Quickly holds the cup at a distance.] Blech! [Looks at it in disgust.] This tea is nothing more than hot leaf juice! \n",
      "ZUKO: [Iroh closely examines his cup. In an annoyed tone.] Uncle, that's what all tea is. \n",
      "IROH: [Angrily.] How could a member of my own family say something so horrible?! We'll have to make some major changes around here. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Iroh angrily takes the tea pot and heads over to the window Jet is spying through. Jet gasps and moves away just in time as Iroh dumps the tea out the window. Jet slowly stalks around the corner of the shop and leaves. The scene changes to the carriage in which Team Avatar is touring in, which is now in the Upper Ring. \n",

      "SOKKA: And who're the mean-looking guys in robes? \n",
      "JOO.DEE: Inside is the Royal Palace. Those men are agents of the Dai Li, the cultural authority of Ba Sing Se. They are the guardians of all our traditions! \n",
      "AANG: [Close-up view. Bored and annoyed.] Can we see the king now? \n",
      "JOO.DEE: [Close-up view.] Oh no, one doesn't just pop in on the Earth King! \n",

      "SOKKA: [Close-up view of Team Avatar. Surprised.] A month? \n",

      "JOO.DEE: [Close-up view over Sokka's shoulder. Smiling.] The Earth King is very busy running the finest city in the world! [Close-up on Sokka, as an annoyed expression covers his face.] But he will see you as soon as time permits. \n",
      "AANG: [Cut to Momo and Aang. Aang turns to look out the window determined.] If we're going to be here for a month, we should spend our time looking for Appa. [At the sound of Appa's name, Momo wakes up.] \n",

      "SOKKA: [Annoyed.] Right. And which of your professors could we ask about the war with the Fire Nation? \n",
      "UNIVERSITY.STUDENT: [Nervously.] Uh ... \n",

      "Fade the next morning, and the scene changes to a blue jay chirping, before the camera pans down to Team Avatar's house. Cut to Katara coming out from the door, yawning and stretching. She takes a roll of papers on a mail slot attached to the wall, and reads it briefly, gasping with excitement, before running back inside.

      "TOPH: [Over Katara's shoulder view.] Well, no offense to you simple country folk, but a real society crowd will spot you a mile away. You've got no manners! [Takes a pastry from a bowl and eats it.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Frontal view.] Excuse me? I've got no manners?! You're not exactly \"lady fancy fingers!\" \n",
      "TOPH: [Burps. Over Katara's shoulder view.] I learned proper society behavior and chose to leave it. [Throws the half eaten pastry to the side.] You never learned anything. And frankly, it's a little too late. [She picks her nose and flicks the snot off her finger.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Side-view of room. Excitedly.] Aha, but you learned it! You could teach us! \n",

      "JET: Maybe you've forgotten why we need to start over. [View of Longshot and Smellerbee from behind Jet. Longshot and Smellerbee look down, guiltily.] Maybe you've forgotten about how the Fire Nation left us all homeless‌. How they wiped out all the people we loved.

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko takes the customer's broadswords and enters a fighting stance. He pulls a table in front of him with his foot and kicks it at Jet, who slices the table with his swords and jumps over it. As he lands, he swings both hook swords at the Fire Nation prince, who deflects the attack and jumps backward on to another table, which is sliced in half by Jet, swinging one sword through the middle of the table. Zuko steps onto one half of the table and balances on one foot. Jet continues his attack by cutting the legs on the half of the table Zuko is standing on. Zuko quickly jumps up, and as he lands, he swings both broadswords at Jet's feet, and Jet somersaults away and lands in a crouching position before charging forward at Zuko again. Zuko swings both of his swords at Jet. Just as both weapons clash together, the scene freezes and cuts to the Ba Sing Se Palace. Several high class citizens are lined up and being admitted inside by a guard, who is checking the invitation of one group before letting them pass.

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As the guard points his finger to the side, Katara and Toph move out disappointedly, when Katara notices a carriage, from which Long Feng comes out, and two Dai Li agents bow to him. Katara has an idea, and she, along with Toph, go to the leader of the Dai Li. \n",
      "KATARA: [Side-view.] Sir, I'm sorry to bother you, but my cousin lost our invitations. [Whispering.] She's blind. [Again, normally.] Do you think you could help us? Our family's inside and I'm sure they're very worried. \n",

      "LONG.FENG: [Close-up shot.] Now where is your family? I'd love to meet them. \n",
      "KATARA: [Side-view. Feigning looking around.] Uh ... I don't see them right now, but I'm sure we'll find them soon. [Smiles.] Thanks for all your help. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As they walk away, Long Feng appears in front of them. \n",
      "LONG.FENG: Don't worry, as your escort it would be dishonorable to abandon you ladies without finding your family first. We'll keep looking. [He turns around and leads the two girls, while Katara glances at Toph, nervously.] \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As Jet swings at Zuko's feet, Zuko stabs one of his broadswords through the hilt, pinning it to the ground. Jet looks at it with annoyance before focusing back on Zuko. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Both the combatants lose a sword, and continue fighting with only one. He turns in a circle and tries to swipe at Zuko, but Zuko quickly advances and swings his sword at Jet. Jet pulls his attack just in time to bend backward and avoid Zuko's blade, cutting the straw sticking out of Jet's mouth in half. The scene replays, but the second time, zooms in on the straw. Jet regains balance, and jumps backward onto the edge of a well. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang uses his hands and foot to airbend a gust at the guest. His hat is blown off, along with Momo. It dries the water on her, but also turns her hair, clothes, and makeup into a mess, leading Aang to smile sheepishly. The guest is briefly shocked, but smiles in amazement. \n",
      "GUEST: [Amazed.] The Avatar! I didn't know the Avatar would be here. \n",

He smiles, while twirling the dagger in his hand, and helps Tycho to his feet.] \n",
      "IROH: [Hands the knife back to Tycho.] With a solid stance, you are a much more serious threat. [Iroh demonstrates a proper stance, which Tycho attempts to imitate, but is still not assuming the correct form.

Once he finishes, he jumps off his scooter and lands in the center of the pen he made. He earthbends again, causing a square portion of the ground to descend and creates a small pit. He turns around and brings his arms up high to cause some large pillars of earth to rise, making plateaus, turns, and punches outward which makes more walls to separate the animals.\n",

      "JIN: [Removes her palms from her eyes.] Oh, wow, [Cut to a shot showing the candles lit. Jin looks at Zuko, amazed. She walks up to him, looking at the candles.] What happened? How did they light? What did you? [She looks at a smiling Zuko.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They both turn to look at the fountain. As Zuko looks at them, Jin brushes her hand through her hair, smiles at him, and holds his hand.

      "TRAINER: [Sighs.] I understand [The camera fades from black to show a circus trainer standing outside a cage.] you've had a rather hard time lately. That's too bad. You probably felt you had no choice but to behave outrageously, like a wild animal. [Cut to outside the cage, where the trainer pats Appa on the head.] But don't worry. You won't anymore. [Frontal shot. Darkly.] Because I am going to break you. \n",

It grabs the third ring with its beak and throws it at the trainer, who catches it. Appa continues sucking cabbages into his mouth while the trainer's back is turned. \n",
      "TRAINER: Of course, when you perform, the hoops will be flaming. And if you are careful, you won't get burned. [Appa belches loudly and the circus trainer quickly turns around.] You're about to be sorry.

      "TRAINER: [Walking in front of Appa with the circus master, Shuzumu.] He's a difficult creature, stubborn and willful. I need more time with him. It's too risky right now. \n",
      "SHUZUMU: [Closer shot of him and the trainer.] Too risky? What are you talking about? [Raises his hands up.] This is the circus, home of fear and danger. [Points at Appa.] I want the wind buffalo to perform tonight. \n",
      "TRAINER: [Turns to Appa.] If you don't behave yourself, you'll regret it. [Firebends a flame in front of Appa, causing the bison to reel back in fear, and walks away.] \n",

      "PATHIK: [Blinks in confusion.] Hello. I am Guru Pathik. [Aerial shot as Appa flies to the back of the balcony and closer shot as he growls at the guru.] I know I'm not the person you expected. And I didn't expect to be licked by a giant tongue just now. [Side shot of Appa and Pathik on the balcony.] The world is full of surprises. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa growls at the guru. Pathik lies down and closes his eyes. Later, he opens his eyes and looks at Appa, who growls in return. Pathik closes his eyes again and later opens one eye at Appa. Appa snorts in return. Fade to night time, this time Appa asleep and snoring. Pathik stands up and rubs his hands together. He walks over to Appa and places his hand on Appa's upper stomach. \n",
      "PATHIK: Oh, dear. You've been through so much recently. Hurt and betrayed. So twisted up inside. [Moves his hand.] You're still full of love. Ah. But fear has moved in where trust should be. [The camera shows a further shot of the balcony and pans up to the Air Temple; voice-over.] I've been expecting you and the young Avatar for quite a long time. I had a vision many years ago of helping him. That's why I came to the Eastern Air Temple. [Closer shot of Appa and Pathik.] Oh, your emotions are so turbulent. Like swirling storm clouds. [Puts his hand on Appa's forehead.] Let the clouds in your mind be gentle, peaceful ones. [Appa purrs and the shot fades to black.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa wakes up and looks around hostilely. He notices some fruit right in front of him and gobbles it up and follows a path of fruit. Cut to a raised platform which Appa approaches on top of the platform, Pathik feeds a bird some seeds while another bird perches on his head and two squirrels. \n",
      "PATHIK: Someone looks very well rested, [Cut to Appa, whose fur on one side of his head is slightly messed up.] judging by your bed head. [Appa growls and shakes away the bed head.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to the moon and pan down to Pathik meditating. Appa paces behind him twice and collapses. Pathik opens his eyes and places his hand on Appa's side. He stands up, holding a scroll. \n",
      "PATHIK: I have prepared a message for Aang. May I attach it to your horn? [Appa mutter in agreement and Pathik ties the scroll to Appa's horn. Cut to the leaves falling overhead and pan down to Appa and Pathik.] You and the Avatar's energies are mixed. You have an unbreakable bond. By reading your energy, I can sense where Aang is. [Appa licks him.] Funny, what invisible strings connect us all. [Places his hand on Appa's forehead. Further shot of the Air Temple as a path of light illuminates a pathway.] I'll see you again, great beast. [Closer shot of Pathik and Appa.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera fades to white. Cut to Appa flying toward Ba Sing Se at night. He flies over a wall. Another shot of Appa shows two Dai Li agents on the roof who descend once they see Appa. Appa continues flying over the city and his eyes widen when he hears a high-pitched whistle. Shot changes to three pygmy pumas standing on a roof top as Appa descends. Cut to Aang's bison whistle. A further shot shows Aang asleep with his bison whistle and a curled-up Momo at his sides.\n",
      "Cut to Long Feng blowing on his own high-pitched whistle. Long Feng steps out of the shadows. Appa growls at him and takes a step back, leaving a single footprint in the mud. Long Feng earthbends the slab of rock beneath him, causing it to swirl around and capture Appa underground. Shot of Appa's footprint in the mud fades to a further shot of the dust around the slab of rock dissipating. Fade to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens to Team Avatar's place of stay in Ba Sing Se, where Sokka is drawing inaccurate pictures of Appa for missing posters. Katara and Aang enter. \n",
      "KATARA: [Cheerfully.] We found a printer to make our posters! [Reveals the poster and Aang smiles and points at it.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Hey, I thought designing the lost Appa poster was my job. I've been working all day on my Appa! [Shows his crudely drawn picture of Appa with a proud smile. Cut to an exasperated Aang while Katara tries to hold back her laughter.] \n",
      "AANG: Sokka, the arrow is on Appa's head. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Dismayed.] This is his head. [Points to the sketch.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Takes the picture from Sokka, looks confused.] Why are feet coming out of it? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Snatches back the picture indignantly.] Those are his horns. [Hangs his head.] I haven't seen him in a while, okay? \n",
      "TOPH: [Mockingly.] It looks just like him to me! \n",
      "SOKKA: Thank you, I worked really- [Suddenly remembering that she is blind.] Why do you feel the need to do that? \n",
      "KATARA: Let's just stick with the professional version. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka angrily rips up his drawing. \n",
      "AANG: [Excitedly.] Come on, let's get busy! [Holds up some pamphlets.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Aang and Momo dropping dozens of posters all over Ba Sing Se. One poster falls in front of the camera, and the scene changes to tea shop where Zuko and Iroh are working. Iroh serves tea to two customers, who enjoy it. They approach him. \n",
      "QUON: So, you're the genius behind this incredible brew. The whole city is buzzing about you! I hope Pao pays you well. \n",
      "IROH: Good tea is its own reward. \n",
      "QUON: But it doesn't have to be the only reward. How would you like to have your own tea shop? \n",
      "IROH: [Frontal view. Pao looks around, concerned.] My own tea shop? This is a dream come true! \n",
      "PAO: [Quickly moving to stand between the group.] What's going on here? Are you trying to poach my tea-maker? \n",
      "QUON: Sorry Pao, but that's business for you, am I right? \n",
      "PAO: Mushi, if you stay, I'll make you assistant manager. Wait, senior assistant manager! \n",
      "QUON: I'll provide you with a new apartment in the Upper Ring. [Cut to Zuko, who was busy putting empty tea cups on a tray, but now looks up and glances over his shoulder to follow Quon's offer more closely; voice-over.] The tea shop is yours to do whatever you want, [Cut back to frontal shot of Quon.] complete creative freedom. \n",
      "IROH: I even get to name the shop? \n",
      "QUON: Of course! \n",
      "PAO: Uh, senior executive assistant manager? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Iroh hands him the pot of tea and bows to the customer, agreeing to the terms. Zuko walks by, as Pao walks away sadly. \n",
      "IROH: Did you hear, nephew? This man wants to give us our own tea shop in the Upper Ring of the city! \n",
      "QUON: That's right, young man, your life is about to change for the better! \n",
      "ZUKO: [Sarcastically.] I'll try to contain my joy. [Walks outside, slams door shut.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As he walks outside, he grabs a falling Appa poster. He climbs to the top of a house and notices several of them falling. He searches the skies for any sign of the Avatar.\n",
      "Back at the house. Sokka and Katara are playing a game. Toph is just relaxing as Aang re-enters. \n",
      "AANG: I just finished dropping all the leaflets. Has anyone come in with news about Appa? \n",
      "KATARA: It's only been a day. Just be patient. [Aang sits.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A knock at the door and Aang jumps up and runs to the door. \n",
      "AANG: Wow, you're right! Patience really pays off! [Opens the door.] Joo Dee? \n",
      "JOO.DEE: Hello, Aang, and Katara, and Sokka, and Toph. \n",
      "SOKKA: [They approach as Joo Dee enters.] What happened to you? Did the Dai Li throw you in jail? \n",
      "JOO.DEE: What? Jail? Of course not. The Dai Li are the protectors of our cultural heritage. \n",
      "TOPH: But you disappeared at the Earth King's party. \n",
      "JOO.DEE: Oh, I simply took a short vacation to Lake Laogai, out in the country. It was quite relaxing. \n",
      "KATARA: But then they replaced you with some other woman who also said her name was Joo Dee. \n",
      "JOO.DEE: [Surprised.] I'm Joo Dee. \n",
      "AANG: Why are you here? \n",
      "JOO.DEE: Dropping fliers and putting up posters isn't permitted within the city. Not without proper clearance. \n",
      "SOKKA: We can't wait around to get permission for everything. \n",
      "JOO.DEE: You are absolutely forbidden by the rules of the city to continue putting up posters. \n",
      "AANG: [Angrily yelling; during this brief argument, Aang is shown as a chibi.] We don't care about the rules and we're not asking permission! We're finding Appa on our own and you should just stay out of our way! [Slams the door as she exits.] \n",
      "SOKKA: That might come back to bite us in the blubber. \n",
      "AANG: [Calming down.] I don't care! From now on, we do whatever it takes to find Appa! \n",
      "TOPH: Yeah, let's break some rules! [Takes out a side of the house with earthbending.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo flies out the broken side of the house and they all exit. Two Dai Li agents watch overhead from a house roof across the street. \n",
      "The scene changes to the Royal Palace, where Long Feng meets with that particular Joo Dee. Two Dai Li agents stand guard. \n",
      "LONG.FENG: I'm very disappointed in your work with the Avatar and his friends, Joo Dee. I had hoped that you would be able to control this situation. \n",
      "JOO.DEE: I am so sorry, but they don't trust me anymore. [Starts getting upset.] I don't think I can keep working like this! [Begins to sob.] \n",
      "LONG.FENG: Joo Dee, the Earth King has invited you to Lake Laogai. \n",
      "JOO.DEE: [Camera zooms toward her eye as its iris dilates.] I am honored to accept his invitation. \n",
      "LONG.FENG: [Nods.] Good. Now go await further orders. [Joo Dee nods and begins to exit. Long Feng gets up and moves to the fireplace.] If the Avatar keeps searching for his bison, it could upset the delicate balance we've worked so hard to achieve in this city. It could even cost us control of the Earth King. \n",
      "DAI.LI.AGENT: Should we take care of him? \n",
      "LONG.FENG: No. It's much too dangerous for us to confront him directly. Let's see if we can still handle this quietly. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: At Iroh and Zuko's place of stay, which is about to change. Zuko enters Iroh's room. Iroh is packing his clothes. \n",
      "IROH: So, I was thinking about names for my new tea shop. How about the Jasmine Dragon? It's dramatic, poetic, has a nice ring to it. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Shows Iroh the flyer.] The Avatar is here in Ba Sing Se and he's lost his bison. \n",
      "IROH: [Grabs the flyer.] We have a chance for a new life here. [Cut to Zuko looking out a window.] If you start stirring up trouble, we could lose all the good things that are happening for us. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Turns to Iroh.] Good things that are happening for you! Have you ever thought that I want more from life than a nice apartment and a job serving tea? \n",
      "IROH: There is nothing wrong with a life of peace and prosperity. I suggest you think about what it is that you want from your life and why. \n",
      "ZUKO: I want my destiny. \n",
      "IROH: What that means is up to you. [Zuko walks away.] The Tea Weevil! No, that's stupid. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut back to Team Avatar, who are working to put up more posters. \n",
      "SOKKA: We'll split up to cover more area. Toph, I guess you should just come with me. \n",
      "TOPH: [Peevishly.] Why? Because you think I can't put up posters on my own?! [Angrily takes the paintbrush of glue from Sokka and throws glue on the wall. She puts up a poster, but it is backward.] It's upside-down, isn't it? I'll just go with Sokka. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They all go their separate ways, with Toph following Sokka. Cut to an open square, where Katara is putting up a poster on a stone plinth near a flowing water stream. Suddenly, behind her, she hears a familiar voice call out. \n",
      "JET: Katara? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Jet is seen emerging from an alleyway at the edge of the square. Katara wheels around with a startled gasp. \n",
      "JET: [Walks closer. Smiling confidently.] I think I can help you. [Katara's shocked blush transforms into a look of pure outrage. With a sweep of her arms, she bends up water from a lake directly at him while screaming in rage. Jet looks at the wave in fright.] Katara, I've changed! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The wave hits Jet, sending him back quite a distance. \n",
      "KATARA: [Bending up remaining water from the wave.] Tell it to some other girl, Jet! [Turns the water to ice, which sends Jet back to a wall.] \n",
      "JET: [Blocks the ice with his swords.] I don't want to fight you, I'm here to help! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Throws his swords down, and reaches for something behind his back. Katara quickly fires more ice crystals, which pin him to the wall. The rest of the team approaches. \n",
      "SOKKA: Katara, what is it? \n",
      "KATARA: Jet's back. [Close-up of Jet's face. Cut to aerial view before switching to a closer view of the group.] We can't trust anything Jet says. \n",
      "SOKKA: But we don't even know why he's here! \n",
      "KATARA: I don't care why he's here, whatever the reason is, it can't be good! \n",
      "JET: I'm here to help you find Appa! [Opens his hand and reveals he is holding a missing Appa poster.] \n",
      "AANG: [Turning from the leaflet back to Katara.] Katara, we have to give him a chance. \n",
      "JET: I swear, I've changed! I was a troubled person and I let my anger get out of control, but I don't even have the gang now! I've put all that behind me! \n",
      "KATARA: You're lying! \n",
      "TOPH: [Walks up to Jet and feels the wall he is pinned to.] He's not lying. \n",
      "SOKKA: How can you tell? \n",
      "TOPH: I can feel his breathing and heartbeat. When people lie, there's a physical reaction. He's telling the truth. \n",
      "AANG: Katara, we don't have any leads. If Jet says he can take us to Appa, we have to check it out. \n",
      "KATARA: All right. [Points and looks angrily at Jet.] But we're not letting you out of our sight. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She stabs her finger at Jet once more for emphasis, eyes narrowed. Cut to Jet entering a dimly lit warehouse, which sits empty except for a few sacks and a pile of canvas and rope. \n",
      "JET: This is the place I heard about. \n",
      "AANG: There's nothing here. \n",
      "KATARA: [Preparing to waterbend in defense.] If this is a trap– \n",
      "JET: I told you, I work nearby! Two guys were talking about some giant furry creature they had, I figured it must be Appa! \n",
      "TOPH: He was here! [She shows them a clump of Appa's fur.] \n",
      "AANG: [Sadly.] We missed him. [An old white haired man with a push-broom crosses behind the slumping Aang.] \n",
      "OLD.SWEEPY: They took that big thing yesterday. [Aang straightens with a shocked look.] Shipped him out to some island. About time, I've been cleaning up fur, and various, uhhh ... leavings all day. \n",
      "AANG: [Aang swiftly moves closer to the man.] What island? Where's Appa? \n",
      "OLD.SWEEPY: Foreman said some rich royal type on Whaletail Island bought him up. Guess for a zoo or such. Though, could be the meat that'd be good. \n",
      "AANG: We've got to get to Whaletail Island! [Pauses.] Where's Whaletail Island? [Dejectedly.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Looking at map.] Far, very far. [Puts the map on the ground as they all gather round.] Here it is. It's near the South Pole, almost all the way back home. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, it will take us weeks just to get to the tip of the Earth Kingdom. And then we'll need to find a boat to get to the island. \n",
      "AANG: I don't care. We have a chance to find Appa! We have to try! \n",
      "OLD.SWEEPY: Must be nice to visit an island. I haven't had a vacation for years. \n",
      "KATARA: Don't you have some more hair to clean up? \n",
      "OLD.SWEEPY: Shuffle on, I get you. No more need for Old Sweepy ... \n",
      "KATARA: You're right Aang, right now our first concern has to be finding Appa. We can come back when we have him. \n",
      "SOKKA: All right, let's get moving. \n",
      "JET: I'll come with you. \n",
      "KATARA: We don't need your help! \n",
      "JET: Why won't you trust me? [Walks after Sokka and Aang.] \n",
      "KATARA: Gee, I wonder. \n",
      "TOPH: [After Jet walks away.] Was this guy your boyfriend or something? \n",
      "KATARA: What ... no! \n",
      "TOPH: [Smiles.] I can tell you're lying ... [Katara runs away from her.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back within the city \n",
      "SOKKA: We can take the train out to the wall but then we'll have to walk. \n",
      "AANG: Don't worry, on the way back we'll be flying! \n",
      "TOPH: We're finally leaving Ba Sing Se. [Spreads her arms outward in celebration.] Worst ... city ... ever! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Smellerbee and Longshot appear in the background and notice Jet. \n",
      "SMELLERBEE: [Surprised.] Jet! \n",
      "KATARA: [Looks at Jet angrily.] I thought you said you didn't have your \"gang\" anymore! \n",
      "JET: [Turns to look at Smellerbee, confused.] I don't! \n",
      "SMELLERBEE: [Runs up to Jet and hugs him.] We were so worried. How did you get away from the Dai Li? [Camera quickly zooms in to Katara's shocked face.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Shocked.] The Dai Li?! \n",
      "JET: I don't know what she's talking about! \n",
      "SMELLERBEE: He got arrested by the Dai Li a couple of weeks ago. We saw them drag him away! \n",
      "JET: Why would I be arrested? I've been living peacefully in the city! \n",
      "TOPH: [Feeling the ground between Jet and Smellerbee.] This doesn't make any sense. They're both telling the truth. \n",
      "KATARA: That's impossible. \n",
      "SOKKA: No it's not! Toph can't tell who's lying because they both think they're telling the truth. Jet's been brainwashed! \n",
      "JET: That's crazy! It can't be! [Glances to the sides.] Stay away from me! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They all surround him. Cut to the moon in the night sky. Cut to a Dai Li agent walking the streets. Zuko, disguised as the Blue Spirit, runs by. \n",
      "ZUKO: Out of my way, skinny! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The agent prepares to use his rock glove, but pauses when the disguised man turns into an alley. The agent runs to the alley and sees a figure that appears to be him. He fires his rock gloves at the figure's chest and head, knocking off the stuffed figure's head and knocking it down. \n",
      "DAI.LI.AGENT: Huh? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: There is the whisper of a drawn blade behind him and Zuko, still disguised, captures him and places one of his swords to the agent's neck. \n",
      "ZUKO: If you don't want to end up like him, you'll do what I say. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back in an unknown building, Team Avatar, Longshot, and Smellerbee all surrounding a seated Jet. \n",
      "KATARA: The Dai Li must have sent Jet to mislead us, and that janitor was part of their plot, too! \n",
      "AANG: I bet they have Appa here in the city. Maybe he's in the same place they took Jet! Where did they take you? \n",
      "JET: Nowhere! I- I don't know what you're talking about! \n",
      "AANG: We need to find a way to jog his real memories. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Teasingly.] Maybe Katara should kiss him. That should bring something back! \n",
      "KATARA: Maybe you should kiss him, Sokka! \n",
      "SOKKA: Hey, just an idea! \n",
      "AANG: A bad one. \n",
      "SOKKA: Ooh, wait! I've got it! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka plucks a straw from his mattress, pokes it into Jet's mouth in trademark fashion and regards him thoughtfully. \n",
      "JET: I don't think it's working. [Spits it out.] \n",
      "TOPH: Try to think of something from your past that triggers your emotions. \n",
      "SMELLERBEE: The Fire Nation! Remember what they did to your family! \n",
      "KATARA: Close your eyes. Picture it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Jet closes his eyes, while sweat beads start to form on his forehead. His eyes suddenly snap wide open and he sees images of himself at a younger age watching his town burning down and Mongke looking back at him. \n",
      "JET: [Sweating.] No! It's too painful! \n",
      "KATARA: Maybe this will help. [Takes water and puts it around his ears, using healing to clear his mind.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Jet looks up from the floor and sees an image of Long Feng standing above a lake. Long Feng stares at Jet, and Jet sinks down under the lake into an underground room. He sees an image of a Dai Li agent shining a spinning light in his face. \n",
      "JET: They took me to a headquarters under the water. Like a lake! \n",
      "SOKKA: Wait! Remember what Joo Dee said? She said she went on vacation to Lake Laogai! \n",
      "JET: [Stands up.] That's it! Lake Laogai. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to an aerial shot of Lake Laogai. The camera pans down to show Team Avatar, Jet, Longshot, and Smellerbee standing at the edge of the lake. \n",
      "SOKKA: So where's this secret headquarters? \n",
      "JET: Under the water, I think. \n",
      "TOPH: There's a tunnel right there by the shore. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph points to the side and whistles as she walks to the edge of the shore. She uses her earthbending to bring up a slab of rock with an entrance. She moves the rock out the way with the same technique. They all look down at the tunnel and Momo flies away. Cut to them inside the secret headquarters. Jet checks to make sure the coast is clear and they walk down a long hallway. \n",
      "JET: It's all starting to come back to me! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Jet walks past a room where a member of the Dai Li brainwashes a group of women. \n",
      "BRAINWASHER: I'm Joo Dee. Welcome to Ba Sing Se. \n",
      "JOO.DEES: I'm Joo Dee. Welcome to Ba Sing Se. \n",
      "BRAINWASHER: We're so lucky to have our walls to create order. \n",
      "JOO.DEES: We're so lucky to have our walls to create order. \n",
      "JET: I think there might be a cell big enough to hold Appa up ahead. I think it's through here! [Opens a door.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Appa chained up as a door opens in his cell and Appa wakes up. Cut to Zuko standing at the door, disguised as the Blue Spirit. \n",
      "ZUKO: Expecting someone else? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Jet opens the other door. An overhead shot reveals several Dai Li agents waiting on the ceiling. The door closes suddenly behind them. Lights turn on, revealing the agents. \n",
      "SOKKA: Now that's something different. \n",
      "LONG.FENG: You have made yourselves enemies of the state. Take them into custody. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Dai Li agents jump off the ceiling and surround them. Two agents fire rock gloves, but Toph breaks them up and sends the two agents flying through the air with rock pillars. Jet runs toward the agents and breaks two other gloves fired by agents with his swords, and trips another. A full battle ensues. Aang deals with a pair of Dai Li agents. Sokka and Katara destroy two Dai Li gloves, but a second pair grabs them.\n",
      "Toph saves them by creating a rock wall and she raises ground up. Toph knocks away the four Dai Li agents that attack her, but a glove captures her and Jet swings by to free her. The agent fires his other rock glove, and Longshot fires an arrow, which destroys the glove. Jet jumps in front of Longshot to hold off more of their rock attacks. Long Feng escapes. \n",
      "AANG: [Knocks away two agents with airbending.] Long Feng is escaping! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Jet and Aang chase him. They head into another part of the headquarters with many pipes of all sizes sticking out of the walls, with some of them pouring out water, but are sealed in by Long Feng. \n",
      "LONG.FENG: All right, Avatar, you've caused me enough problems. This is your last chance ... if you want your bison back. \n",
      "AANG: You do have Appa! Tell me where he is! \n",
      "LONG.FENG: Agree to exit the city now, and I'll waive all charges against you and allow you to leave with your lost pet. \n",
      "JET: [Gets in a fighting position.] You're in no position to bargain. \n",
      "LONG.FENG: Am I not? \n",
      "AANG: [Gets into a fighting position.] You're definitely not! \n",
      "LONG.FENG: Jet, the Earth King has invited you to Lake Laogai. \n",
      "JET: [Close-up of his eye, his iris dilates.] I am honored to accept his invitation. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Jet attacks Aang. Cut to Appa growling at the disguised Zuko. Appa tries to strike Zuko, but his chained feet hold him back. \n",
      "ZUKO: You're mine now. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The door opens and Zuko gets into a fighting stance. Iroh enters. \n",
      "ZUKO: Uncle? \n",
      "IROH: So, the Blue Spirit. I wonder who could be behind that mask ... \n",
      "ZUKO: [Sighs and takes off the mask.] What are you doing here? \n",
      "IROH: I was just about to ask you the same thing. What do you plan to do now that you've found the Avatar's bison? Keep him locked in our new apartment? Should I go put on a pot of tea for him? \n",
      "ZUKO: First I have to get it out of here. \n",
      "IROH: [Starts yelling.] And then what!? You never think these things through! [Points at him.] This is exactly what happened when you captured the Avatar at the North Pole! You had him, and then you had nowhere to go! \n",
      "ZUKO: I would have figured something out! \n",
      "IROH: No! If his friends hadn't found you, you would have frozen to death! \n",
      "ZUKO: I know my own destiny, Uncle! \n",
      "IROH: Is it your own destiny, or is it a destiny someone else has tried to force on you? \n",
      "ZUKO: Stop it, Uncle! I have to do this! \n",
      "IROH: I'm begging you, Prince Zuko! It's time for you to look inward and begin asking yourself the big questions. Who are you, and what do you want? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko screams loudly, throwing down his swords and Blue Spirit mask. Cut to the brainwashed Jet continuing to swing at Aang. \n",
      "AANG: Jet, it's me, Aang! [Runs back.] You don't have to do this! \n",
      "LONG.FENG: I'm afraid he no longer has a choice. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Jet resumes his attempts at attacking Aang, who dodges them and uses airbending to knock him back. Jet uses his hook swords to stop himself and he pants heavily. \n",
      "AANG: Jet, I'm your friend! Look inside your heart! \n",
      "LONG.FENG: Do your duty, Jet! \n",
      "AANG: He can't make you do this! [Cut to a close-up of Jet's face as he hangs his head, while panting and sweating.] You're a Freedom Fighter! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: At these final words, Jet straightens in shock. Everything goes white and he has a rapid flashback of his past as a Freedom Fighter, seeing Longshot, Smellerbee, Pipsqueak and the Duke, and him with Katara. The Freedom Fighters cheer fades to him with Smellerbee and Longshot, before showing him sitting down with Iroh and Zuko. Fade to him giving the passengers food, and quickly to him being dragged away by the Dai Li. Fade more rapidly to Jet's brainwashing, and to Long Feng on Lake Laogai. Cut to his burning village, to Iroh, to him with Zuko, to him with Katara, to him watching his burning village crying. Cut to him in a Fire Nation camp, to him with Katara, and to him being brainwashed. Cut back to him crying while watching his village burn as Mongke watches. The flashback ends and Jet's irises return to normal. \n",
      "LONG.FENG: Do it! Do it now! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Jet fires a sword at Long Feng, which misses. Long Feng counters with an uplifted rock which strikes Jet down. Aang runs toward Jet as Long Feng escapes through a pipe in the wall. \n",
      "LONG.FENG: [Escaping upward to a pipe.] Foolish boy. You've chosen your own demise. [Exits.] \n",
      "JET: I'm sorry ... Aang. \n",
      "AANG: Don't be. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The rest of the group arrives, all struck with sorrow and shock as they gather around Jet. Katara stares open-mouthed at Jet, her hands hovering near her mouth in shock. Snapping out of it, she withdraws water from her water skin, with which she covers her hands, and it begins to glow as she kneels down next to him. Cut to a shot from over her shoulder, with Jet glancing at her while she rubs her hands over his chest in an attempt to heal him. After rubbing his chest three times, the glow fades, the water stains Jet's clothing, and Katara looks back over her shoulder toward the rest of the group. \n",
      "KATARA: This isn't good. \n",
      "SMELLERBEE: You guys go and find Appa. We'll take care of Jet. \n",
      "KATARA: We're not going to leave you. \n",
      "LONGSHOT: There's no time. Just go. We'll take care of him. He's our leader. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They stare at Longshot in surprise. \n",
      "JET: Don't worry, Katara. I'll be fine. [Smiles a little.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara closes her eyes in painful sadness and opens them again as she rises. Team Avatar begins to exit. \n",
      "TOPH: [Whispering to Sokka.] He's lying ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a close-up of Smellerbee crying. Longshot watches Team Avatar completely leave through a tunnel that is earthbent open before turning the other way to the other exit and standing guard, prepping an arrow. Smellerbee is seen kneeling next to Jet, rubbing her hands back and forth over him, with her right hand on his forehead.\n",
      "Team Avatar reaches Appa's hold, only to discover that it is empty. \n",
      "AANG: Appa's gone! Long Feng beat us here. \n",
      "SOKKA: If we keep moving, maybe we can catch up with them! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They find an exit back to the beach. As they make their escape, several Dai Li agents jump out from behind them. \n",
      "SOKKA: You think we can outrun them? \n",
      "AANG: I don't think it's gonna matter! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Another group of Dai Li agents, plus Long Feng, stand in front of them. All the agents box them in, lifting up the ground on both sides. Dai Li agents stand on all three walls. Momo flies to Aang. \n",
      "AANG: What is it, Momo? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo flies to the sky. Suddenly, Appa flies down. \n",
      "AANG: Appa! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa smashes through the rock walls, scattering the Dai Li agents. Aang and Toph use earthbending to knock other nearby agents off a cliff and into the lake. Appa confronts Long Feng. \n",
      "LONG.FENG: I can handle you by myself. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Long Feng charges at Appa, but Appa grab his leg and throws him skipping into the lake. Appa spits out Long Feng's shoe. The team cheers and they run toward Appa. \n",
      "SOKKA: Yeah! Appa! \n",
      "AANG: [Happily crying.] I missed you, buddy. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa closes his eyes. A teary-eyed Katara somberly looks over Lake Laogai as they fly over it on Appa. Aang places his hand on her shoulder. The team all gathers in a group hug. Zuko and Iroh emerge from the Dai Li headquarters. \n",
      "IROH: You did the right thing, nephew. [Zuko looks at his Blue Spirit mask as Iroh rests a hand on its shoulder.] Leave it behind. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko walks to the edge and tosses the mask into the water, where it slowly sinks to the bottom of the lake. Fade to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens just outside the vast waters of Lake Laogai. Team Avatar has stopped on a tiny islet in the center of the lake. Aang is embracing Appa, happy upon reuniting with him. \n",
      "AANG: I missed you more than you'll ever know, buddy. [Momo flies into Appa to hug him too. Appa licks Aang, which causes Aang to laugh.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka approaches Katara and Toph. \n",
      "SOKKA: Look, we escaped from the Dai Li. We got Appa back. I'm telling you, we should go to the Earth King now and tell him our plan. We're on a roll. \n",
      "KATARA: One good hour after weeks of trouble isn't much of a roll. \n",
      "SOKKA: We can build on it. If we want to invade the Fire Nation when the eclipse happens, we'll need the Earth King's support. \n",
      "TOPH: What makes you think we'll get it? I don't know if you've noticed, but things don't usually go that smoothly for our little gang. \n",
      "SOKKA: I know, but I've got a good feeling about this. This time will be different. \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka, Long Feng is in control of the city. His conspiracy with the Dai Li is too powerful. I think we should just keep flying and leave this horrible place behind us. \n",
      "TOPH: I'm with Sweetness. I've seen enough of Ba Sing Se. [Raises arms and opens eyes wide.] And I can't even see! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang flies into the shot. \n",
      "AANG: But now that we have Appa back, there's nothing stopping us from telling the Earth King the truth. About the conspiracy and the War. \n",
      "SOKKA: See? Aang's with me. [Puts his arm around Aang and smiles.] It's the whole reason we came here in the first place. We have to try. \n",
      "KATARA: [Thinks for a moment.] Well, I guess if the Earth King knew the truth, things could change. [Sokka and Aang smile.] \n",
      "TOPH: [Stands up.] I don't trust the new positive Sokka. [Points at Sokka in an accusing manner.] Long Feng brainwashed you, didn't he!? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang notices a few ships in the lake. \n",
      "SOKKA: That's probably the Dai Li searching for us. [To Katara.] So? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara thinks for a moment before looking at Sokka. \n",
      "KATARA: [Determined.] Let's fly! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They fly toward the Palace, now with no saddle, holding onto Appa's fur for dear life, especially Toph. \n",
      "TOPH: Can we please buy a new saddle? Riding bareback is terrifying! [Buries face in Appa's back.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They get closer to the palace. \n",
      "SOKKA: There it is! That whole thing is the palace! The Earth King's chamber should be in the center! \n",
      "KATARA: We have to be careful. Long Feng's probably warned the king that we're coming. \n",
      "SOKKA: Why would you assume that? If you ask me, I think we're just gonna sail right in and- [A giant rock almost hits them.] Aahh! \n",
      "TOPH: What was that? \n",
      "SOKKA: Surface-to-air rocks! [Sees more being launched.] More incoming! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They dodge a few more rocks. One gets launched right at Aang, but he destroys it with his hand. Another is launched at them head on, but Aang slices it cleanly in two by swinging his staff at the rock to augment his earthbending. He launches himself from Appa to the front of the palace and slams his staff into the ground, generating a massive earthen wave to knock back the palace guards. Appa lands and roars at the captain's ostrich horse, which causes it to drop the captain and run off. As they continue toward the Earth King, more guards appear and launch earth cubes at the gang. Toph and Aang use earthbending to block the attacks, while Katara uses waterbending to subdue the guards. \n",
      "KATARA: [Water whips two guards.] Sorry! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara turns around and strikes down more guards with her waterbending, though closes her right eye in a sympathetic flinch for a moment as she does so. As more guards rush toward them in an attempt to halt Team Avatar's progress, Toph uses her earthbending to flip the tiles of the walkway, trapping them between them and ensuring a clear passage for the team. \n",
      "KATARA: Sorry! We just need to get through to see the Earth King! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: More guards appear on the opposite end of a bridge and launch two giant statues at them. Toph and Aang create an earth igloo to block the statues. Katara creates an ice ramp to jump to the other side of the bridge and water-whips the guards into the water. Aang freezes them in the water as the rest all jump across. More surface-to-air rocks appear as guards are coming down a giant staircase. Toph uses earthbending to change the stairs into a ramp, causing them all to fall. She and Aang use earthbending to escalate themselves up the stairs. \n",
      "SOKKA: Seriously, we're actually on your guys' side! [Pauses for a moment.] Sorry. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: More guards come and Aang and Toph push them away with earthbending. \n",
      "SOKKA: In there! [They enter the palace.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They come to an area with three doors. More guards appear and Toph easily defeats them all. \n",
      "SOKKA: Toph, which way to the Earth King? \n",
      "TOPH: How should I know? I'm still voting we leave Ba Sing Se. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph defeats more guards while Sokka opens the doors to find the Earth King. The first room is empty, as is the second; outside the second door, a royal guard goes flying to the right off-screen. Sokka bursts into a third room, startling a woman. \n",
      "PALACE.WOMAN: Burglar! [Tries to run, trips, and falls flat on her face.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Shuts the door.] Sorry. Wrong door. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Meanwhile, Zuko and Iroh return from Lake Laogai. The former seems ill. \n",
      "IROH: You did the right thing. Letting the Avatar's bison go free. \n",
      "ZUKO: I don't feel right. [Gets dizzy and passes out.] \n",
      "IROH: Zuko! [Rushes to him.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back at the palace, the team arrives at a pile of rubble. Sokka climbs atop it and sees a gigantic door. \n",
      "SOKKA: Now that's an impressive door. It's gotta go somewhere. [Drops down from the rubble and attempts to kick the door open.] Yaaah! [The door does not move even slightly. Sokka starts trying to push it open, but to no avail. Toph and Aang jump in from behind and bust the door down, knocking Sokka forward in the process. He starts rubbing the back of his head.] A little warning next time? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They arrive in the Earth King's chamber with Kuei sitting in his throne. Long Feng and his Dai Li agents stand in their way. The team takes fighting stances against them. \n",
      "AANG: We need to talk to you. \n",
      "LONG.FENG: [Turns to face the Earth King.] They're here to overthrow you. \n",
      "SOKKA: No, we're on your side. We're here to help. \n",
      "KATARA: You have to trust us. \n",
      "KUEI: [Stands up with a rising aggravated tone.] You invade my palace, lay waste to all my guards, break down my fancy door, and you expect me to trust you? \n",
      "TOPH: He has a good point. \n",
      "KUEI: If you are on my side, then drop your weapons and stand down! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They look at each other for a moment. Aang drops his staff, Katara puts her water whip back in her water skin, Sokka drops his machete, and Toph drops the boulder she is levitating. \n",
      "AANG: [Smiles.] See? We're friends, Your Earthiness. [Gives a slight nervous chuckle.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The king says nothing and just continues to frown grimly. Long Feng signals the Dai Li to cuff their arms with rock gloves. \n",
      "LONG.FENG: [Smiles sinisterly.] Detain the assailants! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Dai Li rush behind Team Avatar. \n",
      "SOKKA: But we dropped our weapons. We're your allies. \n",
      "LONG.FENG: Make sure the Avatar and his friends never see daylight again. [The king looks at him shocked.] \n",
      "KUEI: The Avatar? [Points at Sokka.] You're the Avatar? \n",
      "SOKKA: Uh, no. Him. [Nudges his head at Aang.] \n",
      "AANG: [Effortlessly breaks free of his earth cuffs and raises his arms.] Over here. [Re-attaches the cuffs.] \n",
      "LONG.FENG: What does it matter, Your Highness? They're enemies of the state. \n",
      "KUEI: Perhaps you're right. [Sees Bosco sniff and lick Aang, who laughs, and smiles at Long Feng.] Though Bosco seems to like him. [Looks back at the team.] I'll hear what he has to say. [Long Feng glares at Aang.] \n",
      "AANG: [Walks forward.] Well, sir, there's a war going on right now. For the past one hundred years in fact. The Dai Li's kept it secret from you. It's a conspiracy to control the city, and to control you. \n",
      "KUEI: A secret war? That's crazy! \n",
      "LONG.FENG: Completely! \n",
      "AANG: Long Feng didn't want us to tell you, so he stole our sky bison to blackmail us. And blackmail is the least of his crimes; he brainwashed our friend! \n",
      "LONG.FENG: [Quickly turns to face the king.] All lies. I've never even seen a sky bison, Your Majesty. Frankly, I thought they were extinct. \n",
      "KUEI: [Sits down.] Your claim is difficult to believe. Even from an Avatar. \n",
      "LONG.FENG: [Whispers in his ear.] These hooligans are part of an anarchist cell that my agents have been tracking for weeks. If you listen to them, you're playing right into your own destruction. \n",
      "KUEI: [Thinks for a moment.] I have to trust my advisor. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The agents start taking the team away, but Sokka stops for a moment. \n",
      "SOKKA: Wait! [Turns to face the king with a big smile.] I can prove he's lying. Long Feng said he's never seen a sky bison. Ask him to lift his robe. \n",
      "LONG.FENG: What? I am not disrobing! [The king looks thoughtful before looking at Sokka suspiciously.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang and Sokka smile slyly and nod at each other. Aang blows a large gust of air at Long Feng's legs, lifting his robe and revealing a bite mark left by Appa. \n",
      "AANG: Right there! Appa bit him! \n",
      "SOKKA: Never met a sky bison, huh? \n",
      "LONG.FENG: [Lowers his robe.] That happens to be a large birth mark. [Sarcastically.] Thanks for showing everyone. \n",
      "KUEI: Well I suppose there's no way to prove where those marks came from. \n",
      "SOKKA: Of course there is! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The group gets Appa and brings him in. He opens his mouth. Aang points at the bison's teeth and at Long Feng's mark. \n",
      "KUEI: Yup. That pretty much proves it. [Team Avatar cheers.] But it doesn't prove this crazy conspiracy theory. [Team Avatar becomes downcast.] Though, I suppose this matter's worth looking into. [Team Avatar look at each other approvingly, while Long Feng glares at the king before walking away with his agents.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back in Iroh and Zuko's apartment, Zuko is asleep. He wakes up. \n",
      "IROH: You're burning up. [Dips a cloth in water.] You have an intense fever. [Places the cloth on Zuko's forehead.] This will help cool you down. \n",
      "ZUKO: So thirsty. [Sits up, but Iroh makes him lie back down.] \n",
      "IROH: [Grabs a bucket with a spoon in it; takes out the spoon.] Here's some clean water to drink. [Sits him up slightly.] Stay under the blankets and sweat this out. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko grabs the spoon from Iroh and drinks the water. He tosses the spoon aside and grabs the bucket. He drinks from it, while spilling some out. He tosses the bucket aside and lies back down. Iroh pulls the covers more over him. Meanwhile, on a train, passengers are shocked to see the Earth King, who is standing in the middle of the cart surrounded by guards. \n",
      "KUEI: [Feeling strange from exposition.] So this is what a train is like? I didn't realize it would be this ... public. \n",
      "KATARA: So you've never been outside the Upper Ring before? \n",
      "KUEI: I've never been outside the palace. [Katara and Sokka look at each other; the Earth King looks outside and sees Aang flying on Appa.] Now that's the way to travel. [Looks at Katara and Sokka.] So, may I ask where we're going? \n",
      "SOKKA: Underneath Lake Laogai, Your Kingliness. To the Dai Li's secret headquarters. You're about to see where all the brainwashing and conspiring took place. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the shores of Lake Laogai. The team stand on the shore beside the Earth King and his guards. Toph steps to the edge of the water, and with a hop, reveals the the secret path to the hatch door entrance, though discovers it has been destroyed. \n",
      "TOPH: It's gone! \n",
      "SOKKA: Oh don't tell me- ! [Gives a thumbs up and a fake smile.] That's okay. Still got my positive attitude. \n",
      "KATARA: The Dai Li must've known we were coming and destroyed the evidence! \n",
      "KUEI: [Looks suspicious.] Hm ... [Sarcastically.] That seems awfully convenient. \n",
      "SOKKA: Hey, if anything, this proves the conspiracy exists even more. \n",
      "KUEI: Long Feng was right. This was a waste of time. [Turns to leave.] If you'll excuse me, I'm going back to the palace. \n",
      "KATARA: [Smiles with realization.] The wall. They'll never be able to cover that up in time. \n",
      "AANG: Oh, yeah. [Hops to in front of the king.] If you come with us to the Outer Wall, we can prove to you that the secret war is real. \n",
      "KUEI: No Earth King has ever been to the Outer Wall. [Walks past Aang.] I don't have any more time for this nonsense. [Aang looks depressed.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Runs up to them.] If you come with us, this time you can ride on Appa. [The Earth King stops as Appa lows in the background. A pleased smile grows on his face.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: En route to the Outer Wall. The Earth King is riding on Appa, holding on for dear life and screaming at the top of his lungs in fear, his clothes flapping in the wind. \n",
      "TOPH: First time flying? \n",
      "KUEI: It's both thrilling and terrifying! \n",
      "TOPH: Yeah. I hate it too. \n",
      "KUEI: I have to be honest with you: part of me really hopes that what you're telling me about this war isn't true. \n",
      "AANG: I wish it wasn't. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Meanwhile at the apartment, Iroh again places the moist cloth over his feverish nephew's forehead. Zuko is having a dream that he is the Fire Lord, with no scar on his eye. One red and one blue dragon appear and start circling around the pillars on each side of him. The blue dragon starts circling around Zuko. \n",
      "BLUE.DRAGON: [In Azula's voice.] It's getting late. Are you planning to retire soon, my lord? \n",
      "ZUKO: I'm not tired. \n",
      "BLUE.DRAGON: [Into Zuko's ear.] Relax, Fire Lord Zuko. Just let go. Give in to it. Shut your eyes for a while. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko slowly starts to shut his eyes but widely opens them upon hearing the other dragon. \n",
      "RED.DRAGON: [In Iroh's voice.] No, Fire Lord Zuko! Do not listen to the blue dragon. You should get out of here right now. Go! Before it's too late! [Both dragons are poised to either side of Zuko.] \n",
      "BLUE.DRAGON: Sleep now, Fire Lord Zuko. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The dragons disappear, and the room they're in, as well as the guards watching Zuko, crumble to nothing. The blue dragon reappears in front of him. Two golden eyes appear, followed by the face of the blue dragon, which closes rapidly. \n",
      "BLUE.DRAGON: Sleep. [Voice grows louder and more hostile as it continues talking.] Just like mother! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Charges at Zuko and opens its mouth. Inside the dragon's mouth, Zuko sees his mother, Ursa. Within that darkness, the camera draws closer to Ursa, who drops her hood. \n",
      "URSA: Zuko! Help me! [A distraught Zuko is seen in her eyes.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko disappears through the floor. The sleeping Zuko starts sweating. Meanwhile, Team Avatar arrives at the Outer Wall and sees the drill. \n",
      "AANG: [Points at the drill.] It's still there! \n",
      "KUEI: [Shocked.] What is that? \n",
      "SOKKA: It's a drill. A giant drill [Cut to the drill.] made by the Fire Nation to break through your walls. [Cut to a close-up of the king who looks horrified.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: On top of the wall, they're looking down at the drill. \n",
      "KUEI: I can't believe I never knew. [He looks to his right as Kuei hears something.] \n",
      "LONG.FENG: [Appears on an earth elevator with two Dai Li agents.] I can explain this, Your Majesty. [Walks toward the king.] This is nothing more than ... a construction project. [Gestures his hand to the drill.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Sarcastically.] Really? Then perhaps you could explain why there's a [Points to the drill as Kuei follows to where she is pointing. Cut to the Fire Nation insignia clearly shown on the drill.] Fire Nation insignia on your \"construction project\". \n",
      "LONG.FENG: [The king looks at him suspiciously.] Well it's imported of course. You know you can't trust domestic machinery. [Looks at them worried.] Surely you don't believe these children instead of your most loyal attendant? \n",
      "KUEI: [Looks at Team Avatar and Long Feng.] Dai Li! Arrest Long Feng! I want him to stand trial for crimes against the Earth Kingdom. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Long Feng and Team Avatar look shocked. The two agents behind Long Feng share glances, launch shackles onto his arms and pull him in. \n",
      "LONG.FENG: You can't arrest me! You all need me more than you know! [He is taken away.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Happily.] Looks like Long Feng is long gone! Ha! Ah, yeah, I've been waiting to use that one. [Katara gives him an unimpressed look.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: That night at the Palace, the Earth King is talking with Team Avatar. \n",
      "KUEI: I want to thank you, young heroes, for opening my eyes. All this time, what I thought was a great metropolis was merely a city of fools. And that makes me the king fool. [Buries his face in one of his hands.] We're at war. With the Fire Nation. \n",
      "SOKKA: That's why we came to Ba Sing Se, Your Highness: Because we think you can help us end the war. \n",
      "AANG: [Momo climbs up Kuei's arm.] We don't have much time. There's a comet coming this summer. Its energy will give the firebenders unbelievable strength. They'll be unstoppable. \n",
      "SOKKA: But there is hope. Before the comet comes, we have a window of opportunity: A solar eclipse is coming. The sun will be completely blocked out by the moon, and the firebenders will be helpless. \n",
      "KUEI: What are you suggesting, Sokka? \n",
      "SOKKA: That's the day we need to invade the Fire Nation. [Cut to a close-up of the king. Cut back to Sokka.] The Day of Black Sun. \n",
      "KUEI: I don't know. That would require moving troops out of Ba Sing Se. We'd be completely vulnerable. \n",
      "SOKKA: You're already vulnerable. The Fire Nation won't stop until Ba Sing Se falls. You can either sit back and wait for that to happen, or take the offensive and give yourself a fighting chance. \n",
      "KUEI: [Thinks for a moment as everyone waits anxiously.] Very well. You have my support. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Team Avatar celebrates. Someone else arrives. \n",
      "GENERAL.HOW: Your Majesty. [Walks up to Team Avatar and bows to the king.] I apologize for the interruption. \n",
      "KUEI: [To Team Avatar.] This is General How. He's the leader of the Council of Five, my highest ranking generals. \n",
      "GENERAL.HOW: We searched Long Feng's office. I think we found something that will interest everybody. [Team Avatar look at each other.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: In Long Feng's office, a soldier is carrying a box of papers to the desk. \n",
      "GENERAL.HOW: There are secret files on everyone in Ba Sing Se. Including you kids. \n",
      "AANG: Secret files? \n",
      "KUEI: [Takes out a scroll and reads the side.] \"Toph Beifong.\" [Hands the scroll to General How, who hands it to Toph, who hands it to Katara.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Opens the scroll and reads it.] It's a letter from your mom. Your mom's here in the city. And she wants to see you. [Toph's eyes widen with shock.] \n",
      "TOPH: Long Feng intercepted our letters from home? [Shakes her head.] That's just sad. \n",
      "KUEI: [Takes out another scroll and hands it to Aang.] Aang? \n",
      "GENERAL.HOW: This scroll was attached to the horn of your bison when the Dai Li captured it. \n",
      "AANG: [Opens the scroll and reads it.] It's from the Eastern Air Temple. \n",
      "KATARA: Is there a letter for me and Sokka by any chance? \n",
      "KUEI: [Looks in the box.] I'm afraid not. \n",
      "SOKKA: [He and Katara become downcast.] Oh. \n",
      "GENERAL.HOW: But there is an intelligence report that might interest you. [Hands a scroll to Katara.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Opens the scroll and reads it.] \"A small fleet of Water Tribe ships.\" \n",
      "SOKKA: [Shocked. Appears on Katara's side.] What? That could be Dad! \n",
      "KATARA: [Reads the report with excitement.] \"Protecting the mouth of Chameleon Bay. [Her and Sokka's eyes widen.] Led by Hakoda.\" [Katara and Sokka turn to each other in excitement.] It is Dad! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Meanwhile at the apartment, Iroh is pouring tea. \n",
      "IROH: You should know that this is not a natural sickness, but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying tea. [Feeds Zuko the tea.] \n",
      "ZUKO: What's happening? \n",
      "IROH: Your critical decision. What you did beneath that lake. It was in such conflict with your image of yourself that you are now at war within your own mind and body. [Feeds Zuko more tea.] \n",
      "ZUKO: What's that mean? [Coughs continuously and lies down.] \n",
      "IROH: You are going through a metamorphosis, my nephew. It will not be a pleasant experience, but when you come out of it, [Takes a cloth and wipes Zuko's head.] you will be the beautiful prince you were always meant to be. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back in Long Feng's office. \n",
      "AANG: I can't believe it. There's a man living at the Eastern Air Temple. He says he's a guru. \n",
      "SOKKA: What's a guru? Some kind of poisonous blow fish? \n",
      "AANG: No, a spiritual expert. He wants to help me take the next step in the Avatar journey. He says he can teach me to control the Avatar State. \n",
      "KATARA: And I can't believe we know where our dad is now. \n",
      "TOPH: I know what you mean. My mom's in the city. And from her letter it sounds like she finally understands me. \n",
      "SOKKA: This is all such big news! Where do we even start? \n",
      "KATARA: I hate to say it, but we have to split up. \n",
      "AANG: [Worriedly.] Split up? We just found Appa and got the family back together! Now you want us to separate? \n",
      "KATARA: You have to meet this guru, Aang. If we're going to invade the Fire Nation, you need to be ready. \n",
      "AANG: Well, if I'm going to the Eastern Air Temple, Appa and I can drop you off at Chameleon Bay to see your dad. \n",
      "SOKKA: Someone has to stay here with the Earth King and help him plan for the invasion. [Stands up.] I guess that's me. \n",
      "KATARA: No, Sokka. I know how badly you wanna help Dad. You go to Chameleon Bay. I'll stay here with the king. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Overjoyed with tears welling in his eyes. Stands up and dances happily.] You are the nicest ... sister ... ever! [Throws his arms around Katara and kisses her on the cheek.] \n",
      "KATARA: Easy there, big brother ... [Gives a slight chuckle.] Though you're right. I am. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Outside the Palace, Team Avatar is preparing to leave. The king walks down to them. Katara is petting Appa. Aang turns to face her. \n",
      "AANG: Katara? I need to tell you something. [Starts blushing.] I've been wanting to say it for a long time. \n",
      "KATARA: What is it, Aang? \n",
      "AANG: [Rubs the back of his head.] Katara, I- [He is cut off by Sokka.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Throws Aang in a headlock.] All right. Who's ready to get going on our little men-only man trip? [Noogies Aang. Katara looks at him, annoyed.] \n",
      "KUEI: Aang and Sokka, [They look at him.] I wish you a good journey. Ba Sing Se owes you its thanks. We look forward to your safe return. [Aang, Katara, and Sokka bow.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka starts climbing atop Appa. A soldier walks up to the king. \n",
      "SOLDIER: Your Majesty. There are three female warriors to see you. They're from the island of Kyoshi. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Shocked.] That's Suki! [Falls off Appa.] \n",
      "KUEI: You know these warriors? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Gets up.] Oh yeah. The Kyoshi Warriors are a skilled group of fighters. Trustworthy too. They're good friends of ours. \n",
      "KUEI: Then we shall welcome them as honored guests. \n",
      "KATARA: [Aang turns to Appa.] Wait. Aang. [Hugs him and kisses him on the cheek, which causes him to blush.] \n",
      "TOPH: I'm really gonna miss you guys. \n",
      "KATARA: [Hugs Toph with Aang. Sokka looks away, crossing his arms.] Me too. \n",
      "AANG: Yeah. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Everyone goes to hug him.] Aahh! Great. That's enough. [Smiles.] Okay, we love each other. [Pats Aang and Katara on the head.] Seriously. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa flies off. Back at the apartment, Iroh and Zuko are asleep. Zuko wakes up and walks into the bathroom. He washes his face with water. When he looks in the mirror, he sees himself with no scar, no hair and an arrow tattoo on his head, resembling Aang. He looks horrified. He screams himself awake and breathes heavily. He touches the scar on his face and closes his eyes. Meanwhile, Appa is flying Sokka and Aang. Sokka is resting across Appa's back. \n",
      "SOKKA: You see, Aang? A little positive thinking works wonders. We got the king on our side, we got Long Feng arrested, and when we get back, Suki's waiting for me. \n",
      "AANG: Yeah. Girls are waiting for us. Thanks, positive attitude. \n",
      "SOKKA: Everything is gonna work out perfectly. From now on and forever. [Aang turns around and smiles at him.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: In a prison, Long Feng is sitting in his cell. A Dai Li agent appears outside of the cell. \n",
      "AGENT: [Slides a tray of food underneath the door.] Dinner. [Long Feng grabs some food.] The Council of Five and the military are loyal to the Earth King, [Long Feng looks at him.] but the Dai Li remains loyal to you, Long Feng, sir. [Walks away as Long Feng eats his food while smiling sinisterly.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Meanwhile, at a random house, Toph is outside. She exhales deeply and knocks on the door. It opens on its own. \n",
      "TOPH: [Enters.] Hello? Mom? Anyone home? [Walks to the center of the room. She senses something, but is quickly captured in a metal box.] Hey! Who do you think you're dealing with!? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Xin Fu, the head of a fighting promotion Toph was in, and Master Yu, Toph's former earthbending master, appear. \n",
      "XIN.FU: One loud-mouthed little brat who strayed too far from home. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back at the palace, three Kyoshi Warriors are walking up to the king and bow. \n",
      "KUEI: In our hour of need, it is with the highest honor that I welcome our esteemed allies, the Kyoshi Warriors! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The warriors look up. \n",
      "AZULA: We are the Earth King's humble servants. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The middle warrior is shown to have gold eyes, showing that it is really Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee disguised as Kyoshi Warriors, whom they have previously defeated. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode starts with a view of the exterior of Zuko and Iroh's apartment. Cut to the interior. Iroh is preparing food when Zuko awakens. \n",
      "ZUKO: What's that smell? \n",
      "IROH: It's jook. I'm sure you wouldn't like it. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Sniffs.] Actually, it smells delicious. I'd love a bowl, Uncle. [Holds a bowl up.] \n",
      "IROH: Now that your fever is gone, you seem different somehow. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Optimistically.] It's a new day. We've got a new apartment, new furniture, and today's the grand opening of your new tea shop. [Moves to a table and sits.] Things are looking up, Uncle. [Iroh's shocked expression changes to a smile.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang and Sokka fly on Appa to a Water Tribe camp, where Hakoda is. \n",
      "AANG: You haven't seen your dad in over two years. You must be so excited! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Almost throwing up.] I know I should be, but, I just feel sick to my stomach. [Holds his stomach.] \n",
      "AANG: Don't be nervous. He's going to be so happy to see you! [He puts his hand on Sokka's shoulder who smiles.] \n",
      "SOKKA: So what about you? Are you nervous to meet this guru? \n",
      "AANG: Not at all. I'm ready to master the Avatar State. I'll do whatever it takes. [Sokka gets off Appa.] See you in a week. Yip yip! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang and Appa fly away. Sokka arrives at the camp, where all the warriors greet him warmly. \n",
      "WATER.TRIBE.WARRIOR: Sokka, good to see you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He looks and sees the main tent. Inside, Hakoda, Sokka's father, is looking at a map with more warriors, including Bato, now with scars on his arm. Bato nudges Hakoda and Hakoda becomes happy upon seeing Sokka. \n",
      "HAKODA: Sokka. \n",
      "SOKKA: Hi, Dad. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two embrace. Back at the Earth King's Royal Palace, the \"Kyoshi Warriors\", Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee in disguise, sit before King Kuei. \n",
      "KUEI: Look Bosco! The Kyoshi Warriors are here to protect us! Aren't you excited? [Bosco yawns.] It's been a difficult week for me. My most trusted advisor, Long Feng, and his Dai Li agents tried to take control of Ba Sing Se from me. \n",
      "AZULA: It's terrible when you can't trust the people who are closest to you. \n",
      "KUEI: [Pets Bosco.] But there is good news. As we speak, the Council of Five is meeting to plan an invasion of the Fire Nation this summer, on the day of a solar eclipse. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: For a second, Azula's eyes slightly widen with shock and worry upon hearing this, but she quickly hides it. \n",
      "AZULA: Really? Now that sounds like a fascinating and brilliant plan. [Glances off as Mai and Ty Lee look at each other.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the Council of Five meeting, where Katara and Momo are present. \n",
      "GENERAL.HOW: General Fong's base will serve as the launching point for the attack. In exactly two months, the army and navy will invade the Fire Nation on the Day of Black Sun. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo jumps on the map and begins knocking over the pieces. \n",
      "KATARA: Or we could send in Momo to do some damage! [Chuckles.] 'Cause, the ... sorry. \n",
      "GENERAL.HOW: [Uses earthbending to stand the pieces back up, scaring Momo.] All we need is the Earth King's seal in order to execute the plan. [Sends the scroll across the table to Katara.] \n",
      "KATARA: I'll get these scrolls to him right away. Thank you, General How. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang continues his journey to the Eastern Air Temple. He spots Guru Pathik, who is meditating, and lands Appa. \n",
      "AANG: Uhhh ... hello? You're Guru Pathik, right? [Aang approaches Pathik.] The person who attached the note to Appa's horn? \n",
      "PATHIK: Indeed. I was a spiritual brother of your people, and a personal friend of Monk Gyatso. \n",
      "AANG: In your note, [Aang sits.] you said you could teach me how to gain control of the Avatar State. How? \n",
      "PATHIK: You must gain balance within yourself, before you can bring balance to the world. And the first step to gaining balance begins with this. [Hands Aang a yellow beverage in a wooden cup.] Drink up! \n",
      "AANG: [Takes it and looks at it. Drinks it and quickly spits it out to his left in disgust.] Uggh! It tastes like onion and banana juice! \n",
      "PATHIK: That's because it is! [Pathik empties another bowl and holds it over his head.] Yum yum! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang blinks in disbelief. Meanwhile, Xin Fu and Master Yu are working to bring Toph back to the Beifong Estate. \n",
      "YU: I believe we need to go right! \n",
      "XIN.FU: What are you talking about? The Beifong Estate's this way! \n",
      "YU: I'm quite certain you're mistaken. \n",
      "TOPH: [Banging at the cell.] Hey! Can you two old ladies quit your bickering for a second? I got to go to the bathroom! \n",
      "YU: Oooh ... uhhh, okay, but make it quick! [Getting up with a key in hand.] \n",
      "XIN.FU: [Stopping Yu.] What's wrong with you? \n",
      "YU: Ooh, very sneaky Toph! Nice try, but you can't trick me! [Sits down.] \n",
      "TOPH: Let me out of here so I can kick both your butts! \n",
      "XIN.FU: Quit your banging! [Bangs the metal box.] You might think you're the greatest earthbender in the world, but even you can't bend metal! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph looks sad as she places her hand on a side of the metal box. The scene cuts to that night, and where Azula, Mai and Ty Lee are staying which is a small building in the Upper Ring. Mai and Ty Lee are removing their make-up. A smiling Ty Lee is looking in a mirror. She is wiping the last traces of her Kyoshi makeup from her face. Mai is seated next to Ty Lee, still working on her own face. \n",
      "AZULA: We have been presented with an extraordinary opportunity, girls. \n",
      "TY.LEE: Mai finally gets to wear make-up that's not totally depressing? [Azula walks past toward a window.] \n",
      "MAI: [With large, dark splotches of black makeup dripping down her eyes; Sarcastically.] Ha, ha. \n",
      "AZULA: I'm talking about conquering the whole Earth Kingdom. [The two girls turn with shocked looks.] For one hundred years, the Fire Nation has hammered away at Ba Sing Se from the outside. But now we're on the inside, and we can take it by ourselves. \n",
      "TY.LEE: [Admiringly.] Gosh, you're so confident. I really admire that about you. \n",
      "AZULA: From the inside, we're in perfect position to organize a coup and overthrow the Earth King. The key is the Dai Li. Whoever controls the Dai Li [Turns back into the room.] controls Ba Sing Se. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back to the Eastern Air Temple at a creek. \n",
      "PATHIK: In order to master the Avatar State, you must open all the chakras. Aang, tell me everything you know about chakras. \n",
      "AANG: [Rubs eyes.] What are chakras? \n",
      "PATHIK: Oh, I see. I guess we'll start with the basics. [As he explains he points to the water and the moss within.] The water flows through this creek, much like the energy flows through your body. As you see, there are several pools where the water swirls around before flowing on. These pools are like our chakras. \n",
      "AANG: So chakras are pools of spiraling energy in our bodies? \n",
      "PATHIK: Exactly. If nothing else were around, this creek would flow pure and clear. However, life is messy, and things tend to fall in the creek. And then what happens? \n",
      "AANG: The creek can't flow? \n",
      "PATHIK: Yes. But, if we open the ponds between the pools ... [He removes moss blocking the exit for the water.] \n",
      "AANG: The energy flows! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: In another part of the temple, a cavern. \n",
      "PATHIK: There are seven chakras that go up the body. Each pool of energy has a purpose, and can be blocked by a specific kind of emotional muck. Be warned, opening the chakras is an intense experience, and once you begin the process, you cannot stop until all seven are open. Are you ready? \n",
      "AANG: [Momentarily looks down.] I'll do whatever it takes. \n",
      "PATHIK: First we will open the Earth Chakra, located at the base of the spine. It deals with survival, and is blocked by fear. What are you most afraid of? Let your fears become clear to you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang sees images of things that cause him great fear, including the Blue Spirit attacking him, General Fong sinking Katara into the ground, himself merging with La at the North Pole, Fire Lord Ozai, and Sozin's Comet, which make him scream. \n",
      "PATHIK: Aang, your vision is not real. You are concerned for your survival, but you must surrender those fears. Let your fears flow down the creek. [Aang clears the image away.] You have opened your Earth Chakra! [Aang wipes sweat off his forehead.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Later, behind a waterfall. \n",
      "PATHIK: Next is the ... \n",
      "AANG: Water Chakra? \n",
      "PATHIK: Brilliant! Maybe one day you will be a guru too! This chakra deals with pleasure and is blocked by guilt. Now, look at all the guilt with burdens you so. What do you blame yourself for? \n",
      "AANG: [Sees the image of him leaving home.] I ran away. [Sees images of him in the Avatar State at General Fong's base.] I hurt all of those people. \n",
      "PATHIK: Accept the reality that these things happened, but do not let them cloud and poison your energy. If you are to be a positive influence on the world, you need to forgive yourself. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene cuts to the next day at the Water Tribe camp. \n",
      "HAKODA: This bay leads directly to the outskirts of Ba Sing Se. We've been using these tangle mines to stop the Fire Nation ships from getting through. \n",
      "BATO: [Filling the mine with skunk fish and seaweed before moving away.] Your father invented tangle mines himself. \n",
      "SOKKA: Destructive? Buoyant? And ... [Sniffs and immediately becomes disgusted.] Aggh, ehhh! Terrible smelling! \n",
      "HAKODA: Very perceptive. The mines are filled with skunk fish and seaweed. When a ship detonates the mine, the seaweed tangles up the propeller and the foul smell forces people to abandon the ship. I call it the \"stink and sink.\" \n",
      "SOKKA: [Laughs.] Good one, Dad! \n",
      "BATO: [Nearby, unamused.] You're definitely your father's son. \n",
      "WARRIOR: [Approaching.] Hakoda, our scouts have spotted four Fire Nation ships! \n",
      "HAKODA: Bato, get these mines loaded up! The rest of you men, prepare for battle! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The warriors run off to prepare as Sokka looks around before looking back to his father. \n",
      "SOKKA: Uhhh ... what should I do, Dad? \n",
      "HAKODA: Aren't you listening? I said, \"The rest of you men, get ready for battle\". \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka smiles and departs. Back in Ba Sing Se, at the Jasmine Dragon. Zuko and Iroh observe the happenings standing at the back. \n",
      "IROH: Who thought when we came to this city as refugees, that I'd end up owning my own tea shop? Follow your passion, Zuko, and life will reward you. \n",
      "ZUKO: Congratulations, Uncle. \n",
      "IROH: I am very thankful. \n",
      "ZUKO: You deserve it. The Jasmine Dragon will be the best tea shop in the city. \n",
      "IROH: No. I'm thankful because you decided to share this special day with me. It means more than you know. [The two embrace.] \n",
      "ZUKO: Now let's make these people some tea! [Walks away to the back.] \n",
      "IROH: Yes, let's make some tea! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back to the Eastern Air Temple, Aang and Pathik sit on a ledge. \n",
      "PATHIK: Third is the Fire Chakra, located in the stomach. \n",
      "AANG: [Holding his stomach.] My Fire Chakra would like to eat something other than onion-banana juice. \n",
      "PATHIK: [Chuckles.] Good one! Moving on. This chakra deals with willpower, and is blocked by shame. What are you ashamed of? [Cuts to Aang's vision of his first attempt at firebending, which resulted in him accidentally burning Katara's hands.] What are your biggest disappointments in yourself? \n",
      "AANG: I'm never going to firebend again. I can't. \n",
      "PATHIK: You will never find balance if you deny this part of your life. You are the Avatar and therefore, you are a firebender. [Aang breathes deeply.] Hmmm ... that chakra opened less like a flowing creek, and more like a ... burping bison. \n",
      "AANG: [Loud belch.] Tastes like onions and bananas, but strangely something else. Pickles? [Pathik shrugs.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back at the palace, two Dai Li agents hide on two pillars and secretly spy on a conversation between Mai and Ty Lee. The former is sitting on the stairs and the latter is practicing chi blocking and acrobatics. \n",
      "MAI: [Sighs.] I'm tired of wearing this girly disguise. I don't know how anyone could fight in this. \n",
      "TY.LEE: Maybe that's why it was so easy to beat the Kyoshi Warriors and take their clothes. \n",
      "MAI: How much longer do we have to serve the Earth King? If I have to clean up one more pile of bear poop, I'm going to throw up. \n",
      "TY.LEE: Princess Azula promised we would go back to the Fire Nation as soon as we captured the Avatar. We just have to be patient. \n",
      "MAI: [Stands up.] Shush up! Do you want the whole palace to know we're Fire Nation? \n",
      "TY.LEE: Sorry! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The agents smile and climb away. Azula, who was hiding behind another pillar, walks up to them. \n",
      "AZULA: Good work, girls. I'm sure the Dai Li will deliver the message. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back at the Air Temple. \n",
      "PATHIK: The fourth chakra is located in the heart. It deals with love and is blocked by grief. [Aang smiles and looks at a Air Nomad statue nearby before looking sad.] Lay all your grief out in front of you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang sees images of many airbenders, including Gyatso and Yangchen. He smiles upon seeing them, but becomes saddened as they start to vanish into smoke. \n",
      "PATHIK: You have indeed felt a great loss. [The airbenders appear floating in the clouds.] But love is a form of energy, and it swirls all around us. [Aang is lifted into the air and sees the Air Nomads floating in the smoke.] The Air Nomads' love for you has not left this world. It is still inside of your heart, and is reborn in the form of new love. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The smoke in front of Aang forms a face and shows the first thing he saw upon waking up from his iceberg: Katara. Back in the real world, Aang is starting to cry tears of joy. \n",
      "PATHIK: Let the pain flow away. [Aang wipes away his tears.] Very good. \n",
      "AANG: Can I have some onion-banana juice, please? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Inside another part of the temple. \n",
      "PATHIK: The fifth in the chain is the Sound Chakra, located in the throat. It deals with truth and is blocked by lies. The ones we tell ourselves. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang flashes back to when he, Katara, and Sokka first began their journey to the North Pole. \n",
      "KATARA: Why didn't you tell us you were the Avatar? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back to the real world, Aang finds himself answering the question. \n",
      "AANG: Because I never wanted to be. \n",
      "PATHIK: You cannot lie about your own nature. You must accept that you are the Avatar. [Aang inhales and, seeing an image of himself on a cliff looking down at the ground, exhales, and accepts his nature.] Very good, Aang. You have opened the chakra of truth. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Outside the temple interior. \n",
      "PATHIK: The sixth pool of energy is the light chakra, located in the center of the forehead. It deals with insight and is blocked by illusion. The greatest illusion of this world is the illusion of separation. Things you think are separate and different are actually one in the same. \n",
      "AANG: [An image is shown of the world, with the four nations' territories marked.] Like the four nations. \n",
      "PATHIK: [The image changes so the territories become the same color.] Yes. We are all one people, [The territories become separate again.] but we live as if divided. \n",
      "AANG: We're all connected. Everything is connected. \n",
      "PATHIK: That's right! Even the separation of the four elements is an illusion. If you open your mind, you will see that all the elements are one. Four parts of the same whole. Even metal is just a part of earth that has been purified and refined. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As Pathik speaks, the camera fades to Xin Fu and Yu trying to take Toph home. She feels around the metal cage with seismic sense and feels tiny particles of earth in the metal. She smiles, exhales deeply and begins to push against the metal. \n",
      "TOPH: [Struggling.] Come on, metal. Budge! [She punches a hole in the metal and shakes her hand in pain.] Wooo! Toph, you rule. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She takes another punch as we cut back to Ba Sing Se. Katara walks by the Jasmine Dragon. \n",
      "KATARA: What do you say, Momo? A cup of tea before we get back to the king? [Arrives at the shop.] Table for two, please. \n",
      "ZUKO: Uncle! I need two jasmine, one green, and one lychee! \n",
      "IROH: I'm brewing as fast as I can! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara notices Zuko and Iroh. Stunned, she runs away from the shop. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene returns to Aang and Pathik, who sit at the top of the temple at night. \n",
      "AANG: This is the last chakra, isn't it? \n",
      "PATHIK: Yes. Once you open this chakra, you will be able to go in and out of the Avatar State at will and when you are in the Avatar State, you will have complete control and awareness of all your actions. \n",
      "AANG: Let's do this. \n",
      "PATHIK: The Thought Chakra is located at the crown of the head. It deals with pure cosmic energy, and is blocked by earthly attachment. Meditate on what attaches you to this world. [Images of Katara appear before Aang.] Now, let all of those attachments go. Let them flow down the river, forgotten. \n",
      "AANG: [Coming out of his meditation.] What? Why would I let go of Katara? I ... I love her! \n",
      "PATHIK: Learn to let her go, or you cannot let the pure cosmic energy flow in from the universe. \n",
      "AANG: Why would I choose cosmic energy over Katara? [Aang throws his hands up.] How could it be a bad thing that I feel an attachment to her? Three chakras ago that was a good thing! \n",
      "PATHIK: You must learn to let go. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back at the palace, Katara runs to inform the Earth King, only to encounter the \"Kyoshi Warriors\". \n",
      "KATARA: Thank goodness you're here, Suki. Something terrible is going on. The Fire Nation has infiltrated the city, I just saw Prince Zuko and his uncle! [Azula widens her eyes in surprise and smiles slyly.] We have to tell the Earth King right away! \n",
      "AZULA: Oh, don't worry, I'll be sure to let him know. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara notices \"Suki\" has gold eyes and is shocked upon realization that the \"Kyoshi Warriors\" are actually Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee. She prepares to attack, but Ty Lee quickly jumps forward and blocks her chi. \n",
      "AZULA: [While the three girls gather around the fallen Katara; pans to camera looking up to the three girls.] So, Zuzu's in the city, too? I think it's time for a family reunion. [Momo flies off.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back at the temple. \n",
      "AANG: I'm sorry, but I can't let go of Katara. \n",
      "PATHIK: Aang, to master the Avatar State, you must open all the chakras. Surrender yourself. \n",
      "AANG: Okay, I'll try. \n",
      "PATHIK: Now think of your attachments and let them go. Let the pure cosmic energy flow. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang sees an image of him letting Katara go, and a bridge that will lead him to Avatar State mastery. As he is being surrounded by energy, however, he hears a shriek from Katara and sees a vision of her in chains. He runs away from the end of the road. This cuts his connection to the Avatar State, which drops him back to reality. \n",
      "AANG: Katara's in danger! I have to go! [Prepares to exit.] \n",
      "PATHIK: No, Aang! By choosing attachment, you have locked the chakra! If you leave now, you won't be able to go into the Avatar State at all! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang hesitates but leaves anyway, leaving Pathik concerned. Meanwhile, the journey to take Toph back to her home is stopped when Xin Fu and Yu hear a loud noise. They go to investigate, and notice a hole in the cage and that Toph is gone. \n",
      "YU: It's another one her tricks! \n",
      "XIN.FU: There's a giant hole in the box! How is that a trick!? \n",
      "TOPH: [From behind them.] It's not! It's the real deal! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She earthbends the two men together, throws them in the cage, and metalbends the cage shut. \n",
      "TOPH: [Jumps on top of the box.] I am the greatest earthbender in the world! Don't you two dunderheads ever forget it! [Stomps on the box and exits using earth surfing.] \n",
      "XIN.FU: [Inside the box.] I'm going to be stuck in here forever with you, aren't I? \n",
      "YU: I have to go the bathroom. [Xin Fu groans and slams his head against the box.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back at the Water Tribe camp, Hakoda approaches Sokka. \n",
      "HAKODA: Ready to go knock some Fire Nation heads? \n",
      "SOKKA: You don't know how much this means to me, Dad. I'll make you proud and I'll finally prove to you what a great warrior I am. \n",
      "HAKODA: [Placing his hand on Sokka's shoulder.] Sokka, you don't have to prove anything to me. I'm already proud of you and I've always known you're a great warrior. \n",
      "SOKKA: Really? \n",
      "HAKODA: Why do you think I trusted you to look after our tribe when I left? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Just as the two are boarding the ship, Aang and Appa appear. Aang shows a clear look of concern. \n",
      "SOKKA: This can't be good news. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang and Sokka depart. Just as they're leaving, Sokka looks back at Hakoda, who looks back and grins. Back in Ba Sing Se, Azula is led into a prison by two Dai Li agents. She is taken to Long Feng's cell. \n",
      "AZULA: What is this about? Your agents show up in the middle of the night and drag me down here? You will not treat a Kyoshi Warrior this way! \n",
      "LONG.FENG: But you're not a Kyoshi Warrior, are you, [Standing.] Princess Azula of the Fire Nation? \n",
      "AZULA: What do you want? \n",
      "LONG.FENG: I want to make a deal. It's time that I regain control of Ba Sing Se and you have something I need. \n",
      "AZULA: Oh? \n",
      "LONG.FENG: The Earth King's trust. \n",
      "AZULA: Why should I help you? \n",
      "LONG.FENG: Because I can get you the Avatar. \n",
      "AZULA: [Smirks.] I'm listening ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Long Feng smiles. Back at the Jasmine Dragon, a royal messenger enters. \n",
      "ROYAL.MESSENGER: A message from the Royal Palace. \n",
      "IROH: [Reads through, becomes shocked, and smiles.] I ... I can't believe it! \n",
      "ZUKO: What is it, Uncle? \n",
      "IROH: [Excited.] Great news! We've been invited to serve tea to the Earth King! [Runs off.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko smiles as he continues sweeping. Back in the prison hold, the door to Long Feng's cell is closed. Azula leaves Long Feng's presence and gives a smirk. Fade to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Ostrich horses are drinking water from a river as Appa, Aang, and Sokka fly over them. \n",
      "SOKKA: So, what kind of trouble is Katara in? \n",
      "AANG: I don't know. In my vision, I just knew she needed help. \n",
      "SOKKA: It would be nice if your Avatar powers could be just a little more specific from time to time. [He looks down and notices a mound of earth passing nearby, heading to the wall.] What is that? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They fly down and follow the mound. Toph is seen still earth surfing. Aang and Sokka come down beside her. \n",
      "SOKKA: Need a ride? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph becomes startled at the sound of Sokka's voice and falls backward off of the mound. Sokka and Aang cringe upon seeing her fall. Scene changes to Azula speaking to the Dai Li. \n",
      "AZULA: [While pacing back and forth.] The Earth King and the Council of Five do not trust the Dai Li. They imprisoned your leader, Long Feng. Soon they will turn on all of you and eliminate you. Seizing power today is a matter of life and death. [As she talks, an agent with a mustache starts looking nervous and slightly lowers his head.] This coup must be swift and decisive. The Earth King and each of the five generals must be taken out simultaneously. Long Feng has placed you in my command while we overthrow the government. [Walks over to her left, to another agent with a tiny, vertical scar on his right cheek. When she nears him, she stares sideways at the agent while still addressing all the agents.] If I sense any disloyalty, any hesitation, any weakness at all, [She stops right in front of the scarred agent.] I will snuff it out. [She continues walking, with the eyes of the now nervous scarred agent following her.] That is all. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Dai Li leave, and Azula walks up to Ty Lee, who is pouring tea. \n",
      "TY.LEE: Nice speech, Azula. It was pretty and poetic, but also scary in a good way. [She hands the cup to Azula. Camera pans over to a close-up of Mai.] \n",
      "MAI: [Amused.] Yeah. I thought you were going to make that one guy pee his pants. \n",
      "AZULA: There are still a few loose ends. The Avatar, and my brother and uncle. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene fades to outside the Royal Palace, where Zuko and Iroh begin walking toward it. \n",
      "IROH: Many times I imagined myself here, at the threshold of the palace. [Camera pans to show the Earth Kingdom Emblem above the palace doors.] But I always thought I would be here as a conqueror. Instead, we are the Earth King's personal guests, here to serve him tea. Destiny is a funny thing. \n",
      "ZUKO: It sure is, Uncle. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes back to Appa, Toph, Aang, and Sokka still flying back to the Palace. Toph is seen holding onto Sokka's arm so she does not fall. \n",
      "TOPH: So how did it go with the guru? Did you master the Avatar State? \n",
      "AANG: Uh ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang looks down and thinks back to what Guru Pathik said before he left. \n",
      "PATHIK: If you leave now, you won't be able to go into the Avatar State at all! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fades back to the present. \n",
      "SOKKA: Aang, are you okay? \n",
      "AANG: I'm great! It went great with the guru. I completely mastered the Avatar State. [He laughs nervously and looks down.] Yeah. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes back to the Royal Palace, where Zuko and Iroh are sitting at a table in a room, waiting for the Earth King. Iroh pours some tea into a cup. \n",
      "ZUKO: What's taking so long? \n",
      "IROH: Maybe the Earth King overslept. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Dai Li agents begin to circle around the two. \n",
      "ZUKO: Something's not right. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Azula walks past the Dai Li and comes in front of her brother outside the circle of Dai Li agents. \n",
      "AZULA: It's tea time! \n",
      "ZUKO: [He quickly stands up.] Azula! \n",
      "AZULA: Have you met the Dai Li? They're earthbenders, but they have a killer instinct that's so firebender. I just love it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Camera pans over to show Iroh picking up his cup of tea. \n",
      "IROH: Did I ever tell you how I got the nickname \"the Dragon of the West\"? \n",
      "AZULA: I'm not interested in a lengthy anecdote, Uncle. \n",
      "IROH: It's more of a demonstration, really. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Iroh begins drinking his tea. Zuko looks over at him and smiles before going behind him. Iroh begins breathing fire. Cut to a corridor outside the room as a fire blast makes a hole in the wall, allowing Iroh and Zuko to escape. The Dai Li agents begin shooting some rock gloves at them, but miss as Zuko and Iroh turn around the corner. Iroh generates lightning and destroys the wall in front before jumping down into a bush below. Zuko stops at the edge. \n",
      "IROH: Come on! You'll be fine! \n",
      "ZUKO: No! I'm tired of running! It's time I faced Azula! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko turns around and walks back. Iroh smacks his head upon hearing this and runs away. \n",
      "AZULA: You're so dramatic. What? Are you going to challenge me to an Agni Kai? \n",
      "ZUKO: Yes! I challenge you! \n",
      "AZULA: No thanks. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko shoots a fire blast toward her, but two Dai Li agents intervene and pull up a section of the floor, making a wall. They shoot some rock gloves at Zuko's feet, making him lose his balance. He puts his right hand down, but another rock glove traps that one. Azula turns around smiling and walks away as the agents capture him. Scene changes to inside the throne room, where Sokka, Toph, and Aang confront Kuei. \n",
      "KUEI: Katara's fine. You have nothing to worry about. \n",
      "AANG: But, in my vision, I felt so sure she was in trouble. \n",
      "KUEI: Well, she met with the Council of Generals to plan the invasion, and since then, she been off with your friends, the Kyoshi Warriors. \n",
      "SOKKA: See, Aang? She's with Suki. They're probably back at our apartment right now talking about make-up or something. \n",
      "AANG: Okay. Maybe you're right. \n",
      "KUEI: Believe me, if there was any danger at all, Bosco's animal instincts would sense it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Bosco lifts up his head from sleeping to look at the three. Scene changes to inside the Crystal Catacombs, where Katara is pacing back and forth. She stops pacing upon hearing a hole open up above. \n",
      "DAI.LI.AGENT: You've got company. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He throws Zuko in, who rolls down and lands in front of Katara. \n",
      "KATARA: Zuko! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara's shocked face becomes an angry one as Zuko sits up and the hole closes behind him. The scene changes to Toph, Aang, and Sokka reaching their house on Appa. The three jump off and run inside to see if Katara was in there. Momo runs up to them. \n",
      "AANG: Momo! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo climbs up Aang onto his shoulders. Toph looks around. \n",
      "TOPH: There's no one else here. \n",
      "AANG: Katara is in trouble! I knew it! \n",
      "SOKKA: Oh, no! \n",
      "TOPH: Wait! Someone's at the door. [Someone knocks on the door a second later.] Actually, I know who it is. It's an old friend of mine. [She walks over to the door and opens it, showing Iroh behind the door.] Glad to see you're okay. \n",
      "IROH: I need your help. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka and Aang become shocked and angry upon seeing him, and get into a fighting stance. Toph calmly smiles and waves at him. Momo flies away upon seeing him. \n",
      "AANG: You guys know each other? \n",
      "TOPH: I met him in the woods once and knocked him down. Then he gave me some tea and some very good advice. \n",
      "IROH: May I come in? [Toph nods, and he walks in before turning to the group.] Princess Azula is here in Ba Sing Se. \n",
      "AANG: She must have Katara. \n",
      "IROH: She has captured my nephew as well. \n",
      "AANG: Then we'll work together to fight Azula, and save Katara and Zuko. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Approaching Aang and pointing at him.] Whoa there! You lost me at \"Zuko\". \n",
      "IROH: I know how you must feel about my nephew. [Moving forward to place his hands on Sokka's shoulders.] But believe me when I tell you that there is good inside him. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Pushing Iroh away.] \"Good inside him\" isn't enough! Why don't you come back when it's outside him too, okay? \n",
      "AANG: Katara's in trouble. All of Ba Sing Se is in trouble. Working together is our best chance. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka understands, and nods. Iroh begins walking back to the door. \n",
      "IROH: I brought someone along who might help us. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They all walk outside. Toph puts a couple earth pillars around the nervous Dai Li agent and makes him stand up. Iroh walks over to him and takes the gag off his mouth, revealing this to be the scarred agent. \n",
      "CAPTURED.AGENT: Azula and Long Feng are plotting a coup! They're going to overthrow the Earth King! \n",
      "SOKKA: My sister! Where are they keeping Katara? \n",

      "HEAD.OF.THE.DAI.LI: The movements of the Earth King and all the generals have been plotted out step-by-step. \n",
      "LONG.FENG: Good. And the Fire Nation princess is cooperating? \n",
      "HEAD.OF.THE.DAI.LI: Oh, yes. More than cooperating. She's really taken charge. She's terrifying and inspirational at the same time. It's hard to explain. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Dai Li agent walks away. Scene changes to inside the Crystal Catacombs, where Katara is yelling at Zuko, who sits with his back turned. \n",
      "KATARA: Why did they throw you in here? [Zuko says nothing.] Oh, wait, let me guess. It's a trap. So that when Aang shows up to help me, you can finally have him in your little Fire Nation clutches! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko turns his head to look at her, turns back, and looks at the ground again. \n",
      "KATARA: [Continuing to lament.] You're a terrible person! You know that? Always following us! Hunting the Avatar! Trying to capture the world's last hope for peace! But what do you care? You're the Fire Lord's son. Spreading war and violence and hatred is in your blood! \n",
      "ZUKO: You don't know what you're talking about! \n",
      "KATARA: [Angrily.] I don't? How dare you! You have no idea what this war has put me through! [Sits down.] Me personally! [She sits down and touches her necklace, begins to cry.] The Fire Nation took my mother away from me. \n",
      "ZUKO: [He turns around to face Katara.] I'm sorry. [Pauses.] That's something we have in common. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara looks back, surprised, and wipes away the tears from her eyes. The scene changes to Toph feeling the ground below, finding the Crystal Catacombs. \n",
      "TOPH: Well, what'd you know? There is an ancient city down there. But it's deep. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She makes a tunnel through the ground, beginning to lead to the catacombs. Sokka is seen thinking of a plan. \n",
      "SOKKA: We should split up. Aang, you go with Iroh to look for Katara and the angry jerk, [Remembers Iroh is there and places his left hand on Iroh's right shoulder.] no offense. \n",
      "IROH: [Shrugging.] None taken. \n",
      "SOKKA: And I'll go with Toph to warn the Earth King of Azula's coup. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang and Iroh are seen walking through the tunnel down to the Catacombs. Iroh is bending a small fire for light, and Aang is earthbending the way down. \n",
      "AANG: So, Toph thinks you give pretty good advice, and great tea! \n",
      "IROH: The key to both is proper aging. What's on your mind? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang earthbends again before replying. \n",
      "AANG: Well, I met with this guru who was supposed to help me master the Avatar State and control this great power, but to do it, I had to let go of someone I love. [He and Iroh stop.] And I just couldn't. \n",
      "IROH: Perfection and power are overrated. I think you were very wise to choose happiness and love. \n",
      "AANG: [Earthbends again.] What happens if we can't save anyone and beat Azula? Without the Avatar State, what if I'm not powerful enough? \n",
      "IROH: I don't know the answer. Sometimes, life is like this dark tunnel. You can't always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving, [Aang earthbends the rocks away one last time. Iroh's fire blows out. He smiles.] you will come to a better place. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Camera pans over a large area of the Catacombs. Scene changes to Toph and Sokka climbing the stairs, with Momo flying behind them. \n",
      "SOKKA: There's General How! \n",

      "MAI: Sorry to disappoint you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She shoots some of her daggers at Toph, who uses an earth shield to stop them, and kicks the shield to Mai, who jumps over it. Toph brings up another pillar, knocking her. Ty Lee comes up in front of Sokka, laughing. She starts trying to jab him, but he evades all of them. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph, Sokka, Kuei, and Bosco are all taken to prison. Long Feng walks into the room with some Dai Li agents behind him. \n",
      "LONG.FENG: Now comes the part where I double cross you. Dai Li, arrest the Fire Nation princess! [None of the Dai Li agents move, to Long Feng's disappointment.] I said arrest her! What is wrong with you?! \n",
      "AZULA: It's because they haven't made up their minds. They're waiting to see how this is going to end. \n",
      "LONG.FENG: What are you talking about? \n",
      "AZULA: I can see your whole history in your eyes. You were born with nothing, so you've had to struggle, and connive, and claw your way to power. But true power, the divine right to rule, is something you're born with. The fact is, they don't know which one of us is going to be sitting on that throne, and which one is going to be bowing down. [Long Feng looks worried.] But I know, and you know. [She sits down on the throne and crosses her legs.] Well? \n",
      "LONG.FENG: [Walks up and bows to her.] You've beaten me at my own game. \n",
      "AZULA: Don't flatter yourself! You were never even a player. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to Zuko and Katara in the Crystal Catacombs. \n",
      "KATARA: [Apologetic.] I'm sorry I yelled at you before. \n",
      "ZUKO: It doesn't matter. \n",
      "KATARA: It's just that for so long now, whenever I would imagine the face of the enemy, it was your face. \n",
      "ZUKO: My face? I see. [He touches his scar.] \n",
      "KATARA: No, no, that's-that's not what I mean. [Approaches Zuko.] \n",
      "ZUKO: It's okay. I used to think this scar marked me. The mark of the banished prince, cursed to chase the Avatar forever. But lately, I've realized I'm free to determine my own destiny, even if I'll never be free of my mark. \n",
      "KATARA: Maybe you could be free of it. \n",
      "ZUKO: What? \n",
      "KATARA: I have healing abilities. \n",
      "ZUKO: It's a scar, it can't be healed. \n",
      "KATARA: [Holds up a vial.] This is water from the Spirit Oasis at the North Pole. It has special properties, so I've been saving it for something important. [Moves in front of Zuko.] I don't know if it would work, but ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara puts one hand on Zuko's scar, only to be interrupted by Aang and Iroh. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang! \n",

      "KATARA: Aang, I knew you would come. [She hugs Aang again.] \n",
      "ZUKO: Uncle, I don't understand. What are you doing with the Avatar? [Points to Aang.] \n",
      "AANG: Saving you, that's what. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko takes one step in Aang's direction, but Iroh stops him. \n",
      "IROH: Zuko, it's time we talked. [To Aang and Katara.] Go help you other friends. We'll catch up with you. [They walk away, Katara looks back at Zuko before moving on.] \n",
      "ZUKO: Why, Uncle? \n",
      "IROH: You're not the man you used to be, Zuko. You are stronger and wiser and freer than you have ever been. And now you have come to the crossroads of your destiny. It's time for you to choose. It's time for you to choose good. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko yells as crystals grow to encase Iroh. He assumes a fighting position to prepare for the intruders. A different shot shows Azula along with two Dai Li agents sliding down from the sides of the chamber. \n",
      "AZULA: I expected this kind of treachery from Uncle. [Cut to Iroh, still trapped in crystals. Cut to a side shot, where Zuko protects his uncle.] But Zuko, Prince Zuko, you're a lot of things, but you're not a traitor, are you? \n",
      "ZUKO: Release him immediately. \n",
      "AZULA: It's not too late for you, Zuko. You can still redeem yourself. \n",
      "IROH: [To Zuko.] The kind of redemption she offers is not for you. \n",
      "AZULA: Why don't you let him decide, Uncle? [To Zuko.] I need you, Zuko. I've plotted every move of this day, [Makes a fist.] this glorious day in Fire Nation history, and the only way we win is together. At the end of this day, you will have your honor back. You will have Father's love. You will have everything you want. \n",
      "IROH: Zuko, I am begging you. Look into your heart and see what it is that you truly want. \n",
      "AZULA: You are free to choose. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She gestures at the two Dai Li agents to leave, who earthbend themselves out. The camera cuts to Zuko multiple times as he contemplates his choice as Azula leaves to follow Aang and Katara. Cut to Aang and Katara running through the Crystal Catacombs. \n",
      "KATARA: We've got to find Sokka and Toph. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A bolt of blue lightning attacks them from behind. Aang stops it using earthbending. The camera zooms back toward Azula, the source of the lightning. Katara uses waterbending to stop another lightning attack. The mist from the vaporized water allows Azula to jump onto a crystal and firebend two blasts of blue fire. Together, Aang and Katara use waterbending to stop the blasts. Azula finishes her jump by landing on a rock pillar. Aang uses earthbending on the pillar, and Azula gasps once she notices the pillar crumbling. She jumps off and lands between Katara and Aang. She points at both of them, preparing to attack.\n",
      "A fire blast stops her from attacking, and they look to see the source of the fire blast to be Zuko. Zuko looks from Azula to Katara and Aang, choosing who to attack. Aang gasps once he realizes Zuko will attack him and Aang uses airbending to jump away from the blast. Azula starts dueling with Katara, and Zuko throws multiple fire blasts at Aang. The scene changes to Kuei, Sokka, and Toph in a prison cell. Sokka looks out the door's barred window. \n",

      "SOKKA: Nope, all clear. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph cracks her knuckles and places her hands against the cell door, preparing to metalbend it. Cut to outside the prison cell in the where the door crumples and gets thrown away from the doorway. \n",

      "KUEI: I'm not leaving without Bosco! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka grabs the Earth King's hand and follows the rest of the group. Cut back to Zuko and Aang fighting. Aang airbends the air currents around him to make a human-shaped gust of air at Zuko, knocking him down. Aang attacks Zuko with more airbending, but Zuko maneuvers around the attacks and gets back up on his feet. He fires more blasts at Aang who is clinging on to a rock pillar. Aang jumps onto a clump of crystals to avoid the attack. Furious, Zuko summons a greater blast of fire. Aang earthbends some crystals to protect him, but the crystals shatter, sending Aang flying to another clump of crystals. Zuko uses fire whips to attack Aang once again, but Aang jumps to another patch of crystals and Zuko keeps attacking.\n",
      "Cut to Azula running away from Katara, who sends a wave of water that cuts her hair. Cut back to Zuko, who is still using his fire whips to attack Aang, who is now jumping along the cave's ceiling. Aang kicks down a stalactite and follows it, using earthbending to increase its impact and sending Zuko flying. The scene focuses on Azula and Katara. Katara encases herself in water and uses it to stop Azula's firebending attacks. One water tentacle captures Azula's hand and another one captures her foot. Zuko frees his sister using firebending to break the tentacles. Azula looks toward the crater Aang had created with the stalactite. Aang crawls out, exhausted. Azula runs toward Aang. Cut to Zuko and Katara fighting. Katara still has water whips on her hands and Zuko starts using his fire whips. \n",
      "KATARA: I thought you had changed. [She grunts.] \n",
      "ZUKO: I have changed. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko fires another blast. Cut to Azula and Aang standing opposite each other. A closer shot of Azula and Aang as they prepare to fight. Azula uses firebending to charge at Aang. Aang earthbends crystals around him into a crystal encased armor and charges at Azula. Azula stops, and uses her firebending to break Aang's crystal armor and send him flying back into an old building. Cut to Mai, Ty Lee, and Bosco in the Earth King's throne room. \n",
      "TY.LEE: [To Bosco.] Come on, it's easy. You just walk on your front paws instead of your rear ones. [She demonstrates.] Like this. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Suddenly, the floor traps Ty Lee's hands and her feet when they touch the ground. Bosco starts clapping. The view changes to reveal Kuei, Toph, and Sokka. \n",
      "TOPH: That is a nice trick. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka takes out his boomerang and Toph earthbends a large block of the ground in preparation to fight against Mai. The camera zooms toward Mai. \n",

      "KUEI: [Runs to Bosco.] Bosco! \n",

Aang jumps from the old building and earth surfs toward Zuko and Azula to stop them from attacking Katara. A Dai Li agent breaks Aang's surf, knocking him down. More Dai Li agents gather behind Zuko and Azula. Katara starts regaining her focus and Dai Li agents surround her. Katara uses the octopus form to defend herself. Aang stands up and surveys the scene. \n",
      "AANG: There's too many. [He looks a Katara.] \n",
      "PATHIK: [From Aang's memory.] The only way is to let her go. \n",
      "AANG: I'm sorry, Katara. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Closing his eyes, he turns away from Azula and Zuko and earthbends a crystal shelter tent. Aang starts meditating. Inside Aang's mind, a giant version of himself in the Avatar State, the Avatar Spirit, holds an airbending sphere with a normal-sized version of himself in the Avatar State. Back in the crystal shelter, Aang enters the Avatar State and the crystal shelter starts glowing, alerting those outside. Inside the shelter, Aang opens his glowing eyes and breaks the crystal above him. The camera shows Katara looking up to Aang, now rising in to the air, with hope. But before Aang can let Katara go and control the Avatar State, a bolt of lightning strikes him in the back. Cut to Azula's eyeball watching Aang getting struck, before it zooms out to show her in a lightning summoning position with her fingers smoking. The Avatar Spirit lets go of Aang and falls out of the plane of existence. As Aang falls down, Katara, tears now falling down her face, creates a wave to catch Aang. The wave knocks down the Dai Li agents. She looks down at Aang and back up with tears in her eyes. Zuko and Azula prepare to attack Aang and Katara, but a blast of fire stops them. Iroh jumps down from the wall of the cave and shields Aang and Katara from Zuko and Azula. \n",
      "IROH: You've got to get out of here! I'll hold them off as long as I can! [Fires some blasts at Zuko and Azula.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara walks away slowly with Aang's body to a waterfall, and she uses waterbending to lift her and Aang up its path. Iroh holds off the Dai Li agents until after Aang and Katara leave. He submits to the Dai Li, who use earthbending to encase him in crystals. Zuko looks at Iroh and Iroh closes his eyes and turns away. Cut to Bosco, Kuei, Toph, Sokka, Aang, and Katara riding on Appa. Appa moans sadly. Cut to a closer shot of Katara placing Aang's body on Appa. Katara opens the vial around her neck and uses water healing on Aang's wounded back. The glowing from the spirit water stops, and Katara starts crying. Aang's tattoos glow for a second and Aang gasps. Katara looks at Aang, who smiles a little, and she holds him closer. Cut to the Earth King's throne room with Azula sitting down at the throne with Zuko at her left. \n",
      "AZULA: We've done it, Zuko. It's taken a hundred years, but the Fire Nation has conquered Ba Sing Se. \n",
      "ZUKO: I betrayed Uncle. \n",
      "AZULA: No, he betrayed you. [She stands up from the throne.] Zuko, when you return home, Father will welcome you as a war hero. \n",
      "ZUKO: But I don't have the Avatar. What if Father doesn't restore my honor? \n",
      "AZULA: He doesn't need to, Zuko. [She puts a hand on Zuko's shoulder.] Today, you restored your own honor. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens on board a Fire Nation ship where Aang finally regains consciousness. The camera zooms out on his face as he opens his eyes and rises from his bed, visibly shaken and in pain. \n",
      "AANG: What happened? [Sees the Fire Nation designs and flag and immediately assumes he has been captured.] Oh no! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He leaves his room, carefully creaking open the door and peering outside for any sign of Fire Nation soldiers. Using his glider as a crutch, Aang stumbles across the hall, occasionally leaning on the wall for support due to being weak. He stops at a turn in the hallway upon hearing two guards, who are actually Pipsqueak and The Duke, talking to each other. \n",
      "PIPSQUEAK: You hear something? [Aang retreats behind the wall, where he dons a determined look and quickly steps out to send a weak air blast at them, which only ruffles their clothes, and moves past the hallway.] He's awake! [The two begin chasing Aang, who struggles to escape.] Stop! Wait! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang manages to reach the deck of the ship, however, he stumbles on the stairway and drops his staff. It slides over to where Hakoda and Bato, disguised as Fire Nation soldiers, are petting Momo. \n",
      "AANG: [Confused.] Momo? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo runs toward Aang, jumps on his shoulder and licks his face. Toph and Katara, standing near the edge of the ship, hear the events. \n",
      "TOPH: Twinkle Toes! That's got to be you! \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, you're awake! [The two race over to him.] \n",

      "AANG: Sokka? [Breathes heavily, appears to be passing out.] \n",
      "TOPH: Uh-oh, somebody catch him, he's going to- \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The screen becomes black as Aang collapses to the floor, Katara running short of catching him. The shot cuts to the entire group, including Appa, surrounding Aang who is now in Katara's arms. Meanwhile, on another ship, Zuko is heading toward the Fire Nation. Mai joins him. \n",
      "MAI: Aren't you cold? \n",
      "ZUKO: I've got a lot on my mind. It's been so long, over three years since I was home. I wonder what's changed. I wonder how I've changed. \n",
      "MAI: [Yawns.] I just asked if you were cold, I didn't ask for your whole life story. [Giggles and holds his face in her hands.] Stop worrying. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two kiss. Mai exits, and Zuko stays there with an expression of relief on his face. We return to the ship where Team Avatar is on. Aang is awake once again. He sits in front of Katara, also sitting, surrounded by Toph and Sokka. Appa rests behind them. Aang receives a robe to cover him. \n",
      "AANG: Why are we on a Fire Nation ship? Why is everyone dressed this way? And why am I the only one who's completely out of it? [Katara and Aang are left alone.] \n",
      "KATARA: You need to take it easy, okay? You got hurt pretty bad. [Smiling at him.] I like your hair. \n",
      "AANG: I have hair? [Feels it.] How long was I out? \n",
      "KATARA: A few weeks. \n",
      "HAKODA: Everything okay? \n",
      "KATARA: [Looking away, annoyed. Annoyed tone.] We're fine, Dad. \n",
      "HAKODA: [To Aang.] I'm Hakoda, Katara and Sokka's father. [Aang moves to shake his outstretched hand.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Placing her hands on Aang's shoulders stopping him.] He knows who you are. I just called you \"Dad\", didn't I? \n",
      "HAKODA: I guess you're right. \n",
      "AANG: [Removing Katara's hand he shakes Hakoda's hand.] Nice to officially meet you, Chief Hakoda. \n",
      "HAKODA: It's an honor to meet you. \n",
      "KATARA: Great, great, so now you guys have finally met. So would you mind giving us a little privacy? \n",
      "HAKODA: Of course. [Walks away.] \n",
      "AANG: Are you mad at your dad or something? [Katara looks at Hakoda leave with an expression of annoyance on her face.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Confused look.] What, not at all. Why would you say that? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang shrugs and murmurs as if to say \"I don't know.\" but gasps in pain. \n",
      "KATARA: Maybe we should go upstairs. [Helping Aang up.] You need a healing session. \n",

      "AANG: Wow, you're definitely in the right area there. \n",
      "KATARA: I can feel a lot of energy twisted up around there. [Begins to remove the water.] Let me just see if I can- \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang again flashes back to the battle, to the moment where he was attacked, before moving on to the scene where Katara is looking over him, crying. After that, he snaps back to reality. \n",
      "AANG: I went down! I didn't just get hurt, did I? It was worse than that. I was gone! But you brought me back. \n",
      "KATARA: I just used the spirit water from the North Pole. I don't know what I did exactly. \n",
      "AANG: [Turning to look at her.] You saved me. \n",

      "LI.AND.LO: And the Avatar fell! And the Earth Kingdom fell! \n",
      "LI: Azula's agents quickly overtook the entire city. They went to Ba Sing Se's great walls ... \n",
      "LI.AND.LO: And brought them down! \n",
      "LI: The armies of the Fire Nation surged through the walls and swarmed over Ba Sing Se, securing our victory. \n",

      "LI.AND.LO: Now the heroes have returned home! \n",
      "LO: Your princess, Azula ... [Crowd cheers.] \n",

      "LI.AND.LO: Zuko! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko approaches with a worried expression. Crowd cheers. We now go back to Team Avatar's ship. Sokka sits on a crate with a map with the others surrounding him as he narrates past events. \n",
      "SOKKA: After what happened at Ba Sing Se, we had to get you to safety. We flew back to Chameleon Bay where we found my father and the other Water Tribe men. [Flashback preparing to leave by taking off his Earth King robes revealing traveling robes beneath.] The Earth King decided he wanted to travel the world in disguise, so he set off alone. [Bosco is shown taking off his own attire and hat before Kuei jumps on Bosco and they set off.] Well, not completely alone. [Cut back to Sokka continuing the story.] Soon, the bay was overrun by Fire Nation ships. Rather than fight them all, we captured a single ship and made it our disguise. Since then we've been traveling west. We crossed through the Serpent's Pass a few days ago. We've seen a few Fire Nation ships, but none have bothered us. \n",
      "AANG: So what now? \n",
      "HAKODA: We've been working on a modified version of the invasion plan. \n",
      "KATARA: It's Sokka's invasion plan. \n",
      "HAKODA: Yes, Sokka's plan. We won't be able to mount a massive invasion without the Earth King's armies, but the solar eclipse will still leave the Fire Nation vulnerable. \n",
      "SOKKA: So we're planning a smaller invasion. Just a ragtag team of our friends and allies from around the Earth Kingdom. We already ran into Pipsqueak and The Duke. \n",
      "PIPSQUEAK: [Eating noodles with The Duke on his shoulder.] Good to see you again, Aang! \n",
      "SOKKA: And the best part is, the eclipse isn't even our biggest advantage! [Whispers.] We have a secret ... you! \n",

      "GUARD: Sir ... Admiral Chan has been on leave for two months at Ember Island. \n",
      "FIRE.NAVY.OFFICER: What? Why doesn't anyone ever tell me anything? Something's not right; they should have known that. I think this is a captured ship. [Whispering.] Just stay quiet until we're safely across the ramp. Then we'll sink this ship. \n",

      "AZULA: Who cares? The Avatar is dead ... [Zuko looks away.] unless you think he somehow miraculously survived. \n",

In frustration he bangs his head against his staff. The other ship fires a harpoon, piercing a hole in Team Avatar's ship's bottom.

      "AANG: I just can't stand by and do nothing! [Runs out.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Following.] Aang, no! [Grabs the staff.] You're still hurt, and you have to stay secret! Just let us handle this. \n",
      "AANG: Fine. [Grabs his staff and walks away.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Two fireballs hit the ship causing a fire. Katara quickly extinguishes it with waterbending. \n",
      "TOPH: How are we doing? \n",
      "SOKKA: Things couldn't get much worse. [A serpent rises from the water near their ship.] The universe just loves proving me wrong, doesn't it? \n",
      "TOPH: You make it too easy! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The serpent is hit by a fireball from the other ship. In anger, it wraps itself around the other ship, allowing Team Avatar's ship to escape. \n",
      "SOKKA: Thank you, the universe! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Team Avatar's ship arrives a port in a town. Aang is alone in his room, until the rest of the gang enter. \n",
      "TOPH: Hey, Aang! We're going into town to find some dinner. \n",
      "AANG: [Clutching his stomach.] Well, I am pretty hungry. Maybe dinner's a good idea. \n",
      "SOKKA: Here, [Offering a Fire Nation bandana.] tie this around your head. It will cover your arrow. \n",
      "AANG: I'm not going out if I can't wear my arrow proudly! [He lies back down.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Aang, come on. Be practical. \n",
      "KATARA: [Placing a hand on Sokka's shoulder.] You guys go ahead without us. We'll catch up to you. [Toph and Sokka exit. Katara sits on Aang's bed, placing a hand on his shoulder.] I think I understand why being a secret bothers you so much. You don't want people to think you failed. \n",
      "AANG: You're right, I don't. But the problem is, I did fail! \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, that's not true. \n",
      "AANG: [Getting up.] It is true. I was in Ba Sing Se. I was there! But I lost. And now the Earth Kingdom is fallen for good. \n",
      "KATARA: It's not for good. [Getting up too.] Remember, there's still a plan. The invasion! \n",
      "AANG: And I hate the invasion plan, too! [Rips down the Fire Nation flag covering his staff.] I don't want you or anyone else risking your lives to fix my mistakes! I've always known that I would have to face the Fire Lord. But now I know I need to do it alone. \n",
      "KATARA: [Moving to comfort him.] Aang ... \n",
      "AANG: Katara, please! Just go ... please. \n",
      "KATARA: [Exiting.] Is there anything you need? \n",
      "AANG: I need to redeem myself. I need my honor back. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back at the Fire Nation Capital, Zuko returns to the royal palace and prepares to face his father, Ozai. He breathes deeply and enters. We briefly see Ozai before cutting back to Team Avatar's ship. Katara returns to Aang's room. \n",
      "KATARA: I brought you some food! [Notices Aang has gone missing.] Oh no ... [Drops the food tray and runs.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Aang, flying on his glider. Back at the Royal Palace, Zuko bows before Ozai. \n",
      "OZAI: You've been away for a long time. I see the weight of your travels has changed you. You have redeemed yourself, my son. [Approaches Zuko; the camera pans up to view Ozai's full face for the first time.] Welcome home. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang struggles to remain in flight against his injuries. Back on the ship, Katara runs toward Bato and Hakoda. She is in tears. \n",
      "BATO: I'll leave you two alone. [Exits.] \n",
      "HAKODA: What's wrong, Katara? \n",
      "KATARA: He left. \n",
      "HAKODA: What? \n",
      "KATARA: Aang. He just took his glider and disappeared. He has this ridiculous notion that he has to save the world alone, that it's all his responsibility. \n",
      "HAKODA: Maybe that's his way of being brave. \n",
      "KATARA: It's not brave, it's selfish and stupid! We could be helping him and I know the world needs him, but doesn't he know how much we need him, too? How can he just leave us behind? \n",
      "HAKODA: You're talking about me too, aren't you? \n",
      "KATARA: How could you leave us, Dad? [She attempts to wipe away the tears.] I mean, I know we had Gran-Gran, and she loved us, but we were just so lost without you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Hakoda moves to comfort her as she turns away. \n",
      "HAKODA: I'm so sorry, Katara. \n",
      "KATARA: [Embraces Hakoda.] I understand why you left. I really do, and I know that you had to go, so why do I still feel this way? I'm so sad and angry and hurt! \n",
      "HAKODA: I love you more than anything. You and your brother are my entire world. I thought about you every day when I was gone and every night when I went to sleep, I would lie awake missing you so much it would ache. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene switches to the Royal Palace. \n",
      "OZAI: I am proud of you, Prince Zuko. I am proud because you and your sister conquered Ba Sing Se. I am proud because when your loyalty was tested by your treacherous uncle, you did the right thing and captured the traitor. And I am proudest of all of your most legendary accomplishment: you slayed the Avatar. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Shocked.] What did you hear? \n",
      "OZAI: Azula told me everything. She said she was amazed and impressed at your power and ferocity at the moment of truth. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang continues his flight, struggling. He comes upon a Fire Nation blockade. \n",
      "AANG: A blockade. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He takes a deep breath and swims under it. Upon emerging, he finds a tree bark and rides it like a surfboard through the water. A storm turns the seas very choppy. He falls off and into the water and his staff flies away. We return to the palace. Azula is asleep, when Zuko enters her room. \n",
      "ZUKO: Why'd you do it? \n",
      "AZULA: You're going to have to be a little more specific. \n",
      "ZUKO: Why did you tell Father that I was the one who killed the Avatar? \n",
      "AZULA: Can't this wait until the morning? \n",
      "ZUKO: It. Can't. \n",
      "AZULA: [Sighs and opens her eyes.] Fine. You seemed so worried about how Father would treat you because you hadn't captured the Avatar. I figured if I gave you the credit, you'd have nothing to worry about. \n",
      "ZUKO: But why? \n",
      "AZULA: [Getting out of bed.] Call it a generous gesture. I wanted to thank you for your help and I was happy to share the glory. \n",
      "ZUKO: You're lying. \n",
      "AZULA: [Walking past Zuko.] If you say so ... \n",
      "ZUKO: You have another motive for doing this, I just haven't figured out what it is. \n",
      "AZULA: Please Zuko, what ulterior motive could I have? What could I possibly gain by letting you get all the glory for defeating the Avatar? [Approaching close to Zuko she places a hand on his shoulder.] Unless, somehow, the Avatar was actually alive. All that glory would suddenly turn to shame and foolishness. But you said it yourself, that was impossible. [Zuko begins to leave.] Sleep well, Zuzu. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back in the sea, Aang struggles to stay above water or reach his glider. After letting out a scream, a wave overcomes him and he falls into the water. He re-emerges after a brief time. \n",
      "AANG: I'm not gonna make it. I failed. [Within the lightning strikes, the spirit of Roku appears before Aang.] Roku? \n",
      "ROKU: You haven't failed, Aang. \n",
      "AANG: But everyone thinks I'm dead again. They think I've abandoned them, and I'm losing this war. I'm letting the whole world down. \n",
      "ROKU: If anyone is to blame for the state of the world, it is me. I should have seen this war coming and prevented it. You inherited my problems and my mistakes. But I believe you are destined to redeem me and save the world. \n",
      "AANG: I don't know. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Moonlight shines on on Aang as Yue's spirit appears above. \n",
      "YUE: You already saved the world. And you'll save the world again, but you can't give up. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The storm ends. The spirit of Roku disappears, while Yue's spirit descends toward Aang. \n",
      "AANG: You're right. I won't give up. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He creates a wave and surfs it with the tree bark. Yue's spirit watches him leave and ascends back to moon. Aang is washed up at the base of a volcano, on the same crescent island where Roku's temple once was. Later, Momo finds him and licks his face, waking him up. Katara, Sokka, and Toph find him, reaching him via Appa. Katara runs to hug him, her worried look changing to happiness. \n",
      "KATARA: You're okay! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They all, including Momo and Appa, come together for a group hug. \n",
      "AANG: I have so much to do. \n",
      "KATARA: I know, but you'll have our help. \n",
      "TOPH: You didn't think you could get out of training just by coming to the Fire Nation, did you? \n",
      "AANG: What about the invasion? \n",
      "SOKKA: We'll join up with my dad and the invasion force the day of the eclipse. \n",
      "TOPH: [Notices Aang's damaged staff has washed ashore.] Hey! What's ... oh, it's your glider. \n",
      "AANG: It's okay. If someone saw it, it would give away my identity. It's better for now that no one knows I'm alive. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Flies up and sticks it in the volcano's lava trails, causing it to catch fire as they depart. Scene fades to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens with a shot of the incline leading to the Royal Caldera city, as the camera pans above to an aerial shot of the city. Shot cuts to the Fire Nation Royal Palace, before cutting to Zuko's bedroom, to show Zuko tossing and turning in his bed, unable to sleep. He opens his eyes and gets up, donning a cloak. Cut to the rim of the volcano, as he walks through a path. Cut to the Capital City Prison as Zuko walks toward it. Cut to an overhead shot of him stopping and looking above. Cut to a guard walking around a balcony, who spots him. \n",
      "GUARD: Who's there?! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko, without speaking a word, turns around and walks away. The guard, seeing Zuko leave, resumes his patrol. Scene changes to some islands at day time, as a mysterious cloud goes toward one of the islands at an abnormal speed. Cut to the cloud \"descending\" on one of the islands. \n",
      "AANG: [From inside the cloud.] I think I see a cave below. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Commanding.] Sh! Keep quiet! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang airbends the cloud surrounding Appa as the flying bison lands. Sokka jumps to the ground from Appa and reconnoiters, before crossing his arms and looking toward Team Avatar. \n",
      "SOKKA: Great job with the cloud camo, but next time, let's disguise ourselves as the kind of cloud that knows how to keep its mouth shut. [He reconnoiters again.] \n",
      "TOPH: [Cut to the Toph, Katara, and Aang standing in front of Sokka, who is reconnoitering. Sarcastically.] Yeah, we wouldn't want a bird to hear us chatting up there and turn us in. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Turning back toward the other three.] Hey, we're in enemy territory. [He points above as camera zooms back to show four toucan puffins standing on a rock behind him.] Those are enemy birds. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: One toucan puffin jumps onto Sokka's head and screeches. Cut to the other three as they laugh, and walk toward the cave, with Sokka following behind. Suddenly, he jumps above them and comes \"diving\" down. He looks suspicious, as shot cuts to an aerial shot of him running into the cave, followed by the rest of the group. \n",
      "SOKKA: Well, this is it. [Cut to Sokka standing in front of the other three.] This is how we'll be living until the invasion begins. [His head drops each time he says the word, \"cave\".] Hiding in cave after cave after cave after cave ... \n",
      "KATARA: [Cut to Katara, standing near Aang, from behind Sokka.] Sokka, we don't need to become cave people. What we need is some new clothes. \n",
      "AANG: Yeah, blending in is better than hiding out. [Cut to Aang and Katara.] If we get Fire Nation disguises, [Smiling.] we would be just as safe as we would be hiding in a cave. \n",
      "TOPH: [Cut to Toph, who is sitting down with her legs slightly folded.] Plus, they have real food out there. Does anyone want to sit in the dirt and eat cave hoppers? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph punches the cave wall, causing cave hoppers to jump out, Momo grabs one and eats it. He turns around and spits out a cave hopper limb. \n",
      "SOKKA: Looks like we got outvoted, sport. Let's get some new clothes. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to outside a Fire Nation home near a waterfall. Next to the home, clothes hang out to dry on clotheslines over natural steam vents. Katara, Aang, Sokka, and Toph hide behind a rock wall. \n",
      "AANG: [Whispering.] I don't know about this. [Cut to a view of Team Avatar from the clothes.] These clothes belong to somebody. \n",
      "KATARA: I call the silk robe! [Jumps out from behind the rock wall and grabs two outfits.] \n",
      "AANG: But if it's essential to our survival ... then I call the suit! [Jumps over the wall.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a view of the hanging clothes from inside a house through doorway where a man sleeps. Aang and Toph run across, grabbing clothes. Sokka stands still, examining shirts on the clothesline and grabs the third one. \n",
      "AANG: [Puts on a headband.] Ta-dah! Normal kid. \n",
      "TOPH: Hm ... I should probably wear shoes. But then I won't be able to see as well. [Sits down.] Sorry, shoes. [Pulls on the shoe, launching the sole at Sokka's face, leaving a red mark.] Finally, a stylish shoe for the blind earthbender. \n",
      "KATARA: [Walks partially on camera.] How do I look? [The camera pans from Katara's dress to her whole outfit.] \n",
      "AANG: [Blushing, scratching his head.] Uh ... your mom's necklace. \n",
      "KATARA: Oh, [Touches necklace.] oh, yeah. I guess it's pretty obviously Water Tribe, isn't it? [Takes off the necklace and holds it in her hand.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: In the city, Katara puts some money on a head-wear display. She puts on a Fire Nation necklace, Toph puts on a crown, and Sokka wears a top-knot. Aang pats down Momo's ears and hides him in his shirt. \n",
      "AANG: I used to visit my friend Kuzon here a hundred years ago. So, everyone just follow my lead and stay cool. Or, as they say in the Fire Nation, stay flamin'. [Walks around the building corner. To a man eating meat on a stick.] Greetings, my good hotman. \n",
      "FIRE.NATION.MAN: [Confused.] Uh, hi. [Sokka shrugs at him as he passes.] I guess ... \n",
      "AANG: [Looking at a meat display.] Oh, we're going to a meat place? \n",
      "SOKKA: Come on, Aang, everyone here eats meat. Even the meat. [Points at a hippo cow eating a piece of meat swarming with flies.] \n",
      "AANG: You guys go ahead. I'll just get some lettuce out of the garbage. [Aang and Katara wave each at each other as the rest enter. Turns around to greet random people on the street.] Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Three soldiers approach Aang. \n",
      "MALE.SOLDIER: It's over. We caught you. \n",
      "AANG: [Guiltily.] Who, me? \n",
      "MALE.SOLDIER: It couldn't be more obvious that you don't belong here. [Cut to Aang looking very nervous.] Next time you play hooky, you might wanna take off your school uniform. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang laughs nervously and the soldier grabs Aang. Cut to the two guards push Aang into a classroom. The camera pans across the room, stopping at the teacher, Ms. Kwan. \n",
      "KWAN: Oh. Is this a new mind ready for molding? \n",
      "AANG: That's right. [Knocking on his head.] Let the molding begin. [The two guards turn away to leave.] \n",
      "KWAN: Wait a minute. [The two guards turn back.] You're not from the Fire Nation. [Walks around Aang.] Clearly you're from the colonies. \n",
      "AANG: Yeah, the colonies, of course. The Fire Nation colonies in the Earth Kingdom. [The two guards walk away.] \n",
      "KWAN: Your etiquette is terrible. In the homeland, we bow to our elders. [Walks in front of her desk.] Like so. [Bows.] \n",
      "AANG: Sorry, ma'am. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Bows to her. She taps his hands to correct him. A girl sitting in the front row shows the correct way to bow. Aang bows the proper way this time. \n",
      "KWAN: And we don't wear head coverings indoors. \n",
      "AANG: Um ... I have a scar. It's really embarrassing. \n",
      "KWAN: Very well. What is your name? Or should we just call you \"Mannerless Colony Slob\"? \n",
      "AANG: [Chuckles.] Just \"slob\" is fine. Or, uh, Kuzon. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The school bell rings and the students walk out of school. Momo peeks out of Aang's school uniform. \n",
      "AANG: We made it through the day Momo, and it was pretty fun. \n",
      "ON.JI: [From behind Aang.] Don't let the headmaster catch you with that monkey. [The camera shifts to show her.] \n",
      "AANG: [Turns around, trying to act innocent.] What monkey? \n",
      "ON.JI: Don't worry, I'm not a tattletale. My name's On Ji. I like your headband, by the way. \n",
      "HIDE: [Walks past Aang, slightly bumping him away and puts a hand around On Ji's shoulders.] On Ji, you don't have to baby-sit the new kid. \n",
      "AANG: Wow. [Bows.] You must be one of those popular kids I've been hearing about. \n",
      "HIDE: That's right. Now listen, friend. I know you're from the colonies, so I'll say this slowly. [Leans close to Aang, talking slowly.] On Ji is my girlfriend. [Pokes Aang's chest.] Don't forget it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo tries to get out of Aang's shirt and Aang pushes him back in. Aang pushes Momo back as Hide signifies to Aang that he is watching him and begins to leave. \n",
      "AANG: [Waving goodbye to On Ji and Hide.] It was nice meeting you. \n",
      "SHOJI: [Approaches Aang.] I don't believe it, he didn't beat you up. Not even a little. \n",
      "AANG: I guess I'm just lucky. \n",
      "SHOJI: We were on our way to play hide and explode. You wanna come? \n",
      "AANG: I'd love to. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Shoji, his friends, and Aang all run off to play the game. \n",
      "Cut to Team Avatar's cave. Aang slides down the hill and enters the cave. \n",
      "KATARA: [Concernedly.] Where have you been? We've been worried sick. \n",
      "AANG: [Undoing his headband.] I got invited to play with some kids after school. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Springs up to his feet in shock.] After what?! \n",
      "AANG: I enrolled in a Fire Nation school, and I'm going back tomorrow. \n",
      "SOKKA: [With an exasperated facial expression.] Enrolled in what?! [Falls backward in disbelief.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to an outside-view of the Capital City Prison. Cut to inside, where Zuko walks through the halls and the guard is alerted to his presence. \n",
      "GUARD: [Readies his spear, with it pointed directly at Zuko.] You again? Stop where you are! [Zuko raises his head, looking at the guard.] Prince Zuko ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko grabs the guard by his collar and slams him against the wall. \n",
      "ZUKO: I'm going in for a visit. You're going to stand guard here, and no one is going to know about this. [Zuko releases the guard, enters Iroh's cell, and approaches him.] Uncle, it's me. [Iroh, sitting on the floor, turns away from Zuko with a scowl on his face.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts back to show the team inside the cave sitting around a fire. \n",
      "SOKKA: Aang, I'm trying to be mature and not immediately shoot down your idea, but it sounds ... really terrible. \n",
      "TOPH: Yeah, we got our outfits. What do you need to go to school for? \n",
      "AANG: Every minute I'm in that classroom, I'm learning new things about the Fire Nation. I already have a picture of Fire Lord Ozai. [Holds up the picture.] And here's one that I made out of noodles! [Holds up his picture of Ozai.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Impressive, I admit, but I still think it's too dangerous. \n",
      "AANG: I guess we'll never find out about the secret river then. It goes right to the Fire Lord's palace. We were supposed to learn about it in class tomorrow. \n",
      "SOKKA: Hmm, I am a fan of secret rivers ... fine, let's stay a few more days. \n",
      "AANG: Flamey-o, hotman! [Runs off.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [To Katara.] Flamey-o? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara shrugs and murmurs as if to say \"I don't know.\" Cut to the prison. Zuko is standing inside Iroh's cell. \n",
      "ZUKO: You brought this on yourself you know. We could have returned together. You could have been a hero! [Iroh shifts but does not look at him.] You have no right to judge me, Uncle. I did what I had to do in Ba Sing Se, and you're a fool for not joining me. [Iroh continues ignoring him.] You're not going to say anything? [Kicks up a small stool and destroys it with firebending.] You're a crazy old man! You're crazy! And if you weren't in jail, you'd be sleeping in a gutter! [Zuko leaves, slamming the door behind him as Iroh's head drops slightly and he closes his eyes.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to show the classroom with the class assembled inside. Kwan walks in, and the class collectively rises to bow. \n",
      "KWAN: Good morning class. Recite the Fire Nation oath. [Sits down at her desk.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The class turns to face a large painting of Ozai. \n",
      "CLASS: [Turns to a large painting of Ozai at the back of the class.] My life I give to my country, with my hands I fight for Fire Lord Ozai and our forefathers before him. \n",
      "AANG: [Glances around the room as the class recites the oath.] Fire Lord ... forefathers ... \n",
      "CLASS: With my mind I seek ways to better my country, and with my feet may our March of Civilization continue. \n",
      "AANG: Firebenders ... Fire Lord ... wah, bah, blah, blah. [The class snickers at him as they sit down as the teacher looks on with a stern expression.] \n",
      "KWAN: Since it's obviously hilarious to mock our national oath, we'll begin with a pop quiz on our great March of Civilization. [The class groans and picks up their pens.] Question one: What year did Fire Lord Sozin battle the Air Nation army? [Aang raises his hand.] Kuzon? \n",
      "AANG: Is that a trick question? The Air Nomads didn't have a formal military. Sozin defeated them by ambush. [The entire class stares at him, dumbfounded.] \n",
      "KWAN: Well, I don't know how you could possibly know more than our national history book. Unless you were there a hundred years ago. \n",
      "AANG: I'll just write down my best guess. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera fades to show the music teacher standing at a podium with the rest of the class before him, playing instruments. Aang plays loudly in very discordant notes while moving dancing while sitting. \n",
      "MUSIC.TEACHER: Kuzon? \n",
      "AANG: [Stopping.] I know, I'm a terrible tsungi hornist. \n",
      "MUSIC.TEACHER: No, child. That hullabaloo going on with your feet. Is that a nervous disorder? \n",
      "AANG: I was just dancing. You do dances here in the homeland, right? \n",
      "SHOJI: Not really, no. \n",
      "MUSIC.TEACHER: Dancing is not conducive to a proper learning environment. Young people must have rigid discipline and order. \n",
      "AANG: But what about expressing yourself? \n",
      "MUSIC.TEACHER: I know sometimes we're so ruled by our love for our nation that we can't control our own bodies. [He puts his hand to his face at what he is saying before continuing on.] If you must, you may march in place quietly next time the urge hits you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He settles back down to the podium and the class resumes playing. Aang plays a few notes. marching in place, and stops, looking very dismayed at this. Cut to the school yard. Aang is walking through it, and all the other students stop and stare at him, murmuring among themselves. \n",
      "ON.JI: [Waves at Aang.] Uh, hi, Kuzon. I really liked that crazy dance you were doing. \n",
      "AANG: Thanks On Ji. I could show it to you again if you like. Ah! [He jumps as a blast of fire hits the ground at his feet.] \n",
      "HIDE: What'd you say, colony trash? You're gonna show her something? \n",
      "AANG: [Nervously.] Just some dance movements. \n",
      "HIDE: Nobody shows my On Ji anything, especially movements! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Hide attempts to strike Aang, but Aang easily steps out of the way. The other students gather around to watch. Hide continues trying to punch at Aang, but he continuously evades with ease, much to Hide's frustration. Aang gets behind Hide's back and moves to the side to match Hide's movements. Aang knocks back Hide by butting him. Hide tries to strike Aang two more times, but Aang slides behind Hide through his legs. Hide tries punching Aang two more times and falls down as Aang side steps and trips him. The Headmaster arrives, and Hide sniffles as he gets up to his knees. He is seen with tears in his eyes as the Headmaster talks. \n",
      "HEADMASTER: [Angrily.] Picking fights on your second day? We need to have a conference to discuss your punishment. Bring your parents to my office after school. \n",
      "AANG: [Worriedly.] Parents? But- \n",
      "HEADMASTER: Don't be late! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Headmaster walks off and Hide smirks behind his back. Cut to a picture of Ozai, and the camera pans to show the Headmaster sitting at his office. \n",
      "HEADMASTER: Thank you for coming, Mr. and Mrs ... [Shot changes to show Sokka and Katara in disguise with Aang sitting between them.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Fire. Wang Fire. [Pointing to Katara.] This is my wife, Sapphire. \n",
      "KATARA: Sapphire Fire. Nice to meet you. \n",
      "HEADMASTER: Mr. and Mrs ... Fire, your son has been enrolled here for two days and he's already causing problems. He's argued with his history teacher, disrupted music class, and roughed up my star pupil. \n",
      "KATARA: My goodness! That doesn't sound like our Kuzon. \n",
      "HEADMASTER: That's what any mother would say, Ma'am. Nonetheless, you're forewarned; if he acts up one more time, I'll have him sent to reform school- [Stands up.] by which I mean the coal mines. Are we clear? \n",
      "SOKKA: Don't you worry, Mr. Headmaster. I'll straighten this boy out somethin' fierce! [Turns to Aang.] Young man, as soon as we get home you're gonna get the punishment of a lifetime! [Aang and Katara are visibly alarmed.] \n",
      "HEADMASTER: That's what I like to hear. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They turn to leave, and the scene cuts to show Zuko and Mai sitting on a cliff side together, watching the sunset. \n",
      "MAI: Orange is such an awful color. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Snickers.] You're so beautiful when you hate the world. \n",
      "MAI: I don't hate you. \n",
      "ZUKO: I don't hate you too. [They kiss, but are interrupted by Azula.] \n",
      "AZULA: Ahem. [They turn to look at her, clearly annoyed.] Zuko, could I have a word with you? \n",
      "ZUKO: Can't you see we're busy? [They kiss again.] \n",
      "AZULA: Oh Mai, Ty Lee need your help untangling her braid. \n",
      "MAI: [Stands up.] Sounds pretty serious. [Leaves, but throws an angry glance at Azula behind her back.] \n",
      "AZULA: So, I've heard you've been to visit your uncle fatso in the prison tower. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Standing angrily.] That guard told you. \n",
      "AZULA: No. You did. Just now. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Sits back down.] Okay, you caught me. What is it that you want Azula? \n",
      "AZULA: Actually, nothing. Believe it or not, I'm looking out for you. If people find out you've been to see Uncle, they'll think you're plotting with him. Just be careful, Dum-Dum. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to the cave where the Team is gathered. Momo attempts to pounce on birds, but he misses and they scatter. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Frontal shot.] That settles it! No more school for you, young man! [Strokes his beard.] \n",
      "AANG: I'm not ready to leave yet. I'm having fun for once, just being a normal kid. You don't know what it's like, Sokka. You get to be normal all the time. \n",
      "TOPH: Ha ha! [Sokka glares at her.] \n",
      "AANG: Listen guys, those kids at school are the future of the Fire Nation. If we want to change this place for the better, we need to show them a little taste of freedom. \n",
      "SOKKA: What could you possibly do for a country of depraved little fire monsters? \n",
      "AANG: I'm gonna throw them, [Starts dancing.] a secret dance party! [Everybody stares at Aang.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [In Wang Fire voice.] Go to your room! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the cave with candles on the sides. Toph earthbends a stage. Aang puts on his headband. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Placing a candle.] I can't believe we're having a dance party. It seems so ... silly. \n",
      "AANG: Don't think of it as a dance party, but as a cultural event celebrating the art of fancy footwork! [Dances.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a shot outside we see many pairs of feet as the guests arrive. Cut back to Toph. \n",
      "TOPH: [Feeling their approach.] They're coming! Everyone stop bending. \n",
      "AANG: [To Appa.] Sorry buddy, you should probably wait out back. [Appa grumbles as Aang herds him into the back.] I know, you got fancier feet than anybody. And six of 'em! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to several kids playing instruments on the earth platforms as the guests filter into the room. \n",
      "AANG: [Jumps in front of the stage.] Ladies and gentlemen, the Flamey-O's! Yeah, this ought to get everybody moving. [He looks around at the kids standing shyly at the edge of the cave.] \n",
      "SHOJI: Now what do we do? \n",
      "AANG: This is when you start dancing. \n",
      "MALE.STUDENT.#1: I don't think my parents want me dancing in a cave ... \n",
      "MALE.STUDENT.#2: [Runs in front of the camera.] Yeah! What if someone finds out?! [Looks around nervously before exiting left.] \n",
      "AANG: Oh boy. Listen guys, dancing isn't something you think about. It's a form of self-expression that no one can ever take away from you. \n",
      "SHOJI: Maybe it was different in the colonies, Kuzon, but we don't do that here. \n",
      "AANG: Sure you do, you have for generations! It just so happens that I know several classic Fire Nation dances. A hundred years ago, this was known as the 'Phoenix Flight'. [The students ooh and aah as Aang runs low to the ground.] And, this was the 'Camelephant Strut'. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang jumps from side to side and does a rolls close to two nearby girls as they giggle. Aang finishes the dance with a back flip, landing on one foot. The boys stare in awe at Aang. Cut to Toph and Katara, who drink out of ice cups. \n",
      "TOPH: [To Katara.] Who knew Twinkle Toes could dance? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara smiles. Cut to Zuko back into Iroh's cell. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Sliding food into Iroh's cell as Iroh keeps his back to him.] I brought you some komodo chicken. I know you don't care for it, but I figure it beats prison food. I admit it, I have everything I always wanted, but it's not as all how I thought it would be. The truth is, I need your advice. [Grips the bars.] I think the Avatar is still alive, I know he's out there, I'm losing my mind. [Desperately.] Please, Uncle, I'm so confused I need your help. [Angrily.] Forget it, I'll solve it myself! Waste away in here for all I care! [He glances back before leaving, and a tear slides down Iroh's face.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut back to the cave, where Aang is still dancing, spinning through the air. Aang offers his hand to On Ji, who blushes and accepts. He pulls her to the middle of the room. \n",
      "AANG: And this is how they do it in the ballrooms of Ba Sing Se. [He starts tapping his feet from side to side and On Ji joins him.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Watching as Aang dances with On Ji.] Wow, they look pretty good together. \n",
      "KATARA: [Barely hiding her envy as she looks away.] Eh, if that's what you like ... [She looks back surreptitiously.] \n",
      "AANG: Yeah, that's it! That's the sound of happy feet. [The rest of the kids start dancing with them.] All right, go with that! Everybody freestyle! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: One student dances crazily. Another student, standing amid a group of non-dancers, starts moving his arms and Shoji sways his head with the rhythm. Aang runs over to Katara and holds his hand out to her, inviting her to dance. \n",
      "KATARA: [Looks away nervously.] I don't know, Aang. These shoes aren't really right for dancing, and I-I'm not sure that I know how to- \n",
      "AANG: [Smiling.] Take my hand. \n",
      "KATARA: [Smiles back'.] Okay. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He pulls her out into the room and whispers into her ear, and everybody stops to stare at them as the two extend their arms to each other and begin circling each other and performing dance moves. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, everyone's watching. \n",
      "AANG: Don't worry about them. It's just you and me right now. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara blushes as they began to move around each other in an elaborate dance. The dance incorporates different moves including kicks and flips. At one point they come close together as if they are about to kiss, both just smile and continue on. Aang finishes the dance by catching Katara as she leans over his arm. Cut to a close-up view of them smiling at each other as they pant and sweat. The camera cuts to show the Headmaster and several soldiers coming to the cave. \n",
      "HEADMASTER: It is a dancing party. [Turns to Hide standing behind him.] You did the right thing by telling me, Hide. \n",
      "HIDE: [Bows.] Anytime, Headmaster sir. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera cuts back to the dancing kids. \n",
      "MALE.STUDENT.#1: [Waving a hand in the air.] This is incredible! It's like my inhibitions just disappear! [He sees the Headmaster come into the cave, and immediately stops dancing and attempts to shrink into his robes.] Okay, they're back again. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang continues to dance past as everyone else stops until the Headmaster talks. \n",
      "HEADMASTER: [Pointing.] He's the one we want! The boy with the headband! \n",
      "AANG: Uh-oh. [Aang starts running away through the crowd as the soldiers chase him. One soldier sees a boy with a headband, and grabs him.] \n",
      "MALE.SOLDIER.#1: Gotcha! [The boy turns, but the guard is confused upon seeing a different boy there.] \n",
      "SHOJI: Looking for me? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the Headmaster and Hide. \n",
      "HEADMASTER: That's not the one. He's here somewhere. Don't let him leave the cave! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Headmaster points toward the back of the cave, Hide imitating him. Cut to two soldiers who continue searching. One soldier sees another kid with a headband, and turns her around. He is again confused upon seeing her face. \n",
      "ON.JI: Yes? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Another soldier sees two more children standing next to each other with headbands and turns them both around. \n",
      "MALE.STUDENT.#2: [Picking his nose.] Hi there. \n",
      "MALE.STUDENT.#1: How're we doing? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Headmaster sees who he thinks is Aang in the crowd, and goes after him himself. Shoving people out of the way, he scoops up the boy in the crowd. \n",
      "FEMALE.STUDENT.#1: Looking for someone? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Headmaster looks around in horror as he sees all the children are now wearing headbands. \n",
      "ON.JI: Who are you looking for? \n",
      "FEMALE.STUDENT.#1: Do you need something? \n",
      "STUDENT: Over here. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The students completely surround the soldiers and the Headmaster as Aang escapes through the back of the cave. Shoji winks at Aang, who bows in return. Aang leaves and earthbends the back of the cave shut, at which Shoji drops his jaw in astonishment. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the Headmaster surrounded by guards where two of them have started dancing. \n",
      "HEADMASTER: [To one of the soldiers, who starts dancing.] Stop that! [To another soldier, who is tapping her foot.] Stop that! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to outside the cave where the team flies away on Appa. \n",
      "KATARA: We're safe Sokka, you can take off the mustache now. \n",
      "SOKKA: [He is seen with his Wang Fire mustache on and begins stroking it.] Oh, no I can't. It's permanently glued to my skin. \n",
      "TOPH: [To Aang.] Way to go, dancy pants. I think you really did help those kids, you taught them to be free. \n",
      "AANG: I don't know, it was just a dance party, that's all. \n",
      "KATARA: Well, that was some dance party Aang. [She kisses him on the cheek, and Aang blushes.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Clapping lightly.] Flamey-o sir, flamey-o. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Zuko walking alone in a dark alley. He lowers his hood as a huge man with a metal leg approaches him. \n",
      "ZUKO: You're sure you weren't followed? I've heard about you. They say you're good at what you do, and even better at keeping secrets. The Avatar is alive. I want you to find him, and end him. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The man's face is shown. The camera zooms in on a strange third eye tattooed on his forehead. Fade to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens with Appa, the gang in his saddle, slogging his way down the course of the sludge-infested river Jang Hui in the Fire Nation. Aang and Momo are frolicking in the putrescent water. \n",
      "AANG: Momo! [Dives into the water.] Oh Momo! [Dives again and Momo flies to Aang.] Hahahahaha! You found me, buddy! [Looks down at the water in distaste and airbends up to Appa's saddle, where he stands dripping in sludge.] Hey guys, I think this river's polluted. [Airbends mud off himself, splattering the rest of Team Avatar with mud, which causes them to cry out in disgust.] \n",
      "TOPH: [Tastes mud on her mouth, and spits.] Pah! Plegh! [Aang airbends again, blowing the rest of the mud back into the river and messing up their hair.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Well that explains why I can't catch a fish around here, because normally my fishing skills are off the hook! [Holds up a fishing hook.] Get it? Like a fishing hook? [Grinning.] \n",
      "TOPH: [Countering.] Too bad your skills aren't on the hook. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph, Aang, and Katara laugh as Sokka makes a disgruntled face. \n",
      "KATARA: It looks like we'll need to go somewhere else to get food, [Unrolls a long scroll in front of her.] assuming that'll fit into Sokka's master schedule. \n",
      "SOKKA: Hmmm ... It's doable. But that means only two potty breaks today. \n",
      "AANG: Hey, maybe we can get food there! [Points at a village in the middle of the river.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera zooms to the village and fades to Appa as Aang hides him under a mat of grass. \n",
      "AANG: Now you look just like a little hill with horns! Bye, buddy! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa groans as Momo briefly reveals himself under some more grass nearby. Scene changes to the Jang Hui River, while Toph, Katara, Aang, and Sokka approach the river. \n",
      "TOPH: I don't feel anything. Where is the village? \n",
      "SOKKA: It's in the middle of the river! [Pointing at the village.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Camera pans down to show a man standing on a ferry. \n",
      "DOCK: Sure is! My name's Dock. Mind if I ask who you are? \n",
      "KATARA: We're um ... from the Earth Kingdom colonies. \n",
      "DOCK: Wow ... Colonials. Hop on, I give you ride in the town. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to the river, while Dock paddles the boat across. \n",
      "KATARA: Why do you guys live on the river? [Looking at the village.] \n",
      "DOCK: [Turns his paddle to the right side, pointing at the Fire Nation factory.] Because we're a fishing town. At least that's how it was before the factory moved in. [Closer shot of the Fire Nation factory and pans down.] Army makes their metal there. Moved in a few years ago and started gunking up our river. [Shot changes back to the ferry. Aang and Katara glance sadly at each other.] Now our little village is struggling to survive. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera pans downs to the villagers, showing their conditions of the starving and poor villagers. Team Avatar gets off the ferry boat. \n",
      "AANG: Thanks for the ride! [Waves his hand to Dock, who waves back.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Cut to three villagers sitting on a porch.] Look at this place. [Cut to two other villagers, an old man and a young boy.] It's so sad. [Cut back to Katara looking down.] We have to do something to help. \n",
      "SOKKA: No, we can't waste our time here. We have a bigger mission that we need to stay focused on. These people are on their own. \n",
      "KATARA: [Chases Sokka and grabs his shoulder.] These people are starving! But you'd turn your back on them? [Puts her hands on her hips.] How can you be so cold and heartless? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Shot changes to show their argument from the river as a barrel bobs up and down.] I'm not turning my back, I'm just being realistic. We can't go around helping every rinky-dink town we wander into. We'll be helping them all by taking out the Fire Lord. [Aang guides Toph toward the arguing siblings.] \n",
      "TOPH: [Covering Sokka's mouth with her hand.] Hey, loud mouths! Maybe we should be a little quieter when we talk about \"taking out the Fire Lord.\" \n",
      "SOKKA: Come on, Katara, be reasonable about this. You know our mission has to come first. \n",
      "KATARA: [Reluctantly.] I guess so. [Looks annoyed.] \n",
      "AANG: Let's just get what we need and go. [Smiling to Katara, who smiles back.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to an aerial view of the village. The shot changes to show the counter of an outdoor market stall. As Team Avatar walks up to it, they notice a man who looks like Dock, but wearing a different hat, bowed behind the counter. \n",
      "SOKKA: Hey, Dock. You work here too? \n",
      "XU: I'm not Dock. I'm Xu! Dock's my brother. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Team Avatar looks confused. \n",
      "AANG: But we just saw you. You're even wearing the same clothes. [Close-up of his hat.] The only difference is your hat. \n",
      "XU: [Camera zooms out to Xu talking.] Dock works on the docks. That's why we call him, \"Dock\", and I work in the shop, that's why they call me, \"Xu\"! \n",
      "AANG: I don't get it. \n",
      "XU: Me neither. [Jumps down behind the counter and pulls out a crate filled with rancid gray seafood.] What I can getcha? [Katara, Aang, and Sokka look disgusted.] Hey, I'll give you a special deal. If you buy three fish, I'll give you a clam for free. [Sokka pushes a clam, and mucus splashes out from it.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang and Katara both recoil, muttering in disgust. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Picks up three fish. Carefully.] We'll just take the fish. [Xu takes the fish.] Mind telling your brother we need a ride back to shore? [Xu jumps down behind the counter and jumps up wearing Dock's hat.] \n",
      "DOCK: Hey, colonials! My brother says you need a lift. [Jumps over the counter, and walks to the dock.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Team Avatar follows Dock to the dock. A little boy stops Katara. \n",
      "LITTLE.BOY: Can you spare some food? \n",
      "KATARA: [Touched.] I wish I could help more. [Gives the boy a fish, and the boy bows to her and leaves to give the fish to his sick mother.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to nighttime, as the camera shows an aerial view of Team Avatar's camp. Shot changes to show a barrel of polluted water. Aang lifts the water with waterbending and Toph separates the pollutants from the water with earthbending. Aang passes the water to Katara, who boils it in a crock. \n",
      "SOKKA: Our detour into town today has completely thrown off our schedule. It's gonna take some serious finagling to get us back on track. \n",
      "TOPH: [Sarcastically.] Finagle away, oh schedule master. \n",
      "SOKKA: Well, for starters, it looks like we'll need to wake up forty-three minutes earlier every day. \n",
      "KATARA: Forty-three minutes? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Pointing to various spots on his schedule.] Look, we only have a few weeks to get to the Fire Lord in time for the invasion and the eclipse, which, by the way, only lasts for eight minutes. And we just lost a whole day. So if we want to make up the time and stay on schedule, we have to wake up early! \n",
      "TOPH: Well I'm not waking up early. \n",
      "SOKKA: Or we could just cut out all of our eating breaks. \n",
      "AANG: What? \n",
      "KATARA: No way! \n",
      "TOPH: Forget it! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Gets a sly look on his face.] I got it, how's this from now on, we'll take food breaks and potty breaks at the same time. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara, Toph, and Aang express their disgust at this idea with Aang doing a spit take. \n",
      "SOKKA: Hey, it might be gross, but it's efficient. Either way, we have to leave here first thing tomorrow morning. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Close-up of Katara's face, who looks distraught at Sokka's words. Cut to an aerial view of the village the following morning and cut to the campsite. Appa lies on his side, groaning, while Katara ministers to him. \n",
      "AANG: What's the matter Katara? \n",
      "KATARA: I think Appa's sick. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Panicking.] What? Appa's sick? That's awful! \n",
      "TOPH: Wow, Sokka, I didn't realize you cared so much. \n",
      "SOKKA: Of course I care. I might as well just throw our schedule away now. [Pulls out his schedule. He stops and looks at the group. Cut to a shot of the rest of the gang giving him the evil eye, and he quickly changes his tone, rushing solicitously to Appa's side.] And I'm concerned because my big, furry friend doesn't feel well. \n",
      "TOPH: He must have gotten sick from being in the polluted water. \n",
      "AANG: He doesn't look sick. You okay, buddy? [Appa groans and Aang pulls out Appa's purple tongue.] His tongue is purple! That can't be good. Katara, can you heal him? \n",
      "KATARA: It looks like he needs some medicine. Maybe we can find the right herbs in town. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo arrives and attempts to lick Appa's tongue before being pulled off by Aang. Cut to the village, which is bustling and lively. One villager pole vaults from one house to another. \n",
      "TOPH: Is it just me, or does this place seem different? \n",
      "AANG: Yeah, are the people ... happier? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The little boy from the previous day runs by, bouncing a ball, and Katara smiles to herself. The kids walk up to Xu/Dock's market. \n",
      "SOKKA: Hey, Xu, what's going on with everyone today? \n",
      "XU: [Drinks from a ladle.] Ah, something amazing happened last night. Food was delivered to our village by a mysterious and wonderful person ... the Painted Lady. \n",
      "KATARA: The Painted who now? \n",
      "XU: The Painted Lady. [He places a miniature statuette of the spirit down on the counter.] She's part of our town's lore. They say she's a river spirit who watches over our town in times of need. I always thought she was just a legend. Until now. \n",
      "SOKKA: See, we don't need to help these people, they already have someone to help them. All we need is medicine for our sick friend. \n",
      "XU: Medicine? Sorry, all the medicine we have goes to the factory. That's why there's so many sick people in our village. \n",
      "KATARA: Looks like we need to stay another night so Appa can rest. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sighs.] I guess you're right. You got any more food to sell? \n",
      "XU: [Goes under the counter and emerges holding a fish in each hand.] Would you like the one-headed fish, or the two-headed fish? [He turns the fish on the left sideways to show the second head.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Ponders.] Two-headed! [The rest of the group lowers their heads and small sweat drops appear.] What? You get more for your money that way! [Holds up the polluted fish.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The rest of the group get even bigger exaggerated sweat drops as they express their disgust and run away from Sokka who follows behind with the polluted fish. \n",
      "Fade to the village, late that night. A figure resembling the Painted Lady glides over the water on a carpet of fog and enters the village. She steps into a hut where several people are sleeping on the floor, and bends over each of them in turn, healing them with a blue glow. Her last patient is the mother of the little boy seen earlier, her son sleeping at her side. He wakes as the Painted Lady turns to go and silently follows her out the door. \n",
      "LITTLE.BOY: Thank you, Painted Lady. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The lady stops and nods her head before disappearing into the water. Cut to the village, the next day. Dock polishes his figurine with a rag as Sokka steps up to the counter. \n",
      "SOKKA: Hi, Dock. Is Xu around? \n",
      "DOCK/XU: Let me check ... [He runs around the shop and ducks beneath the counter to switch hats.] Hey there! Back again, are ya? \n",
      "TOPH: [Pushes Sokka away.] We need more food. [Slams the money on the counter.] Our friend is still sick and we can't leave until he's better. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Xu obligingly presents them with a platter of polluted clams. The camera pans in on the clams. Sokka comically slides in behind them and gives silent chuckle along with a comical annoyed symbol on his forehead. It appears he has an idea brewing. \n",
      "XU: Oh, well, that's too bad. Maybe if you guys are lucky, the Painted Lady will visit you in the night, and heal your friend. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Picks up the clams. Sarcastically.] And maybe she'll cook us a midnight snack, and we'll all have a sing-along. \n",
      "XU: [Not getting the sarcasm. Sokka looks annoyed now.] Yeah, may be! You know, last night she visited us again. Healed most of our sick folks. \n",
      "AANG: Is that why this place seems so festive? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A villagers raises a large statue of the Painted Lady in the town square, everyone cheers and applause. \n",
      "DOCK: Yep, it's all because of the Painted Lady. \n",
      "KATARA: Can you believe how much an entire village can be affected by one lady I mean ... spirit? \n",
      "SOKKA: Well, I hope she returns every night. Otherwise this place would go right back to the way it was. \n",
      "KATARA: [Gets annoyed.] Why would you say that? Look how much better off these people are. \n",
      "SOKKA: Yeah, now, but without her they wouldn't be able to fend for themselves. If she really wanted to help, she would use her spirit magic to blow up that factory. [He makes mocking gestures to indicate explosive spirit magic. He crosses his arms with a smile. Katara gets even more annoyed. The screen pans to the right to show Aang who has his arms crossed not impressed.] \n",
      "AANG: Spirit magic doesn't work that way, Sokka. It's more like ... [He waves his body with arms in the air making similar gestures to indicate spirit magic. Katara storms away from the two.] \n",
      "AANG.AND.SOKKA: [Sokka wraps and arm over Aang's shoulder and the two combined their little imitation but far more ridiculous.] Wooooooooo ... [Sokka chuckles.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Katara on the edge of a dock looking out toward the factory. Cut to the campsite, that night. Katara slips out of her sleeping bag and stuffs dried grass into it to disguise her absence. She dons a makeshift Painted Lady costume, wrapping a ragged gown around her. Katara bends the water to make a mirror so she can apply the markings. She puts on a wide conical hat similar to the Painted Lady's, but with a diaphanous white veil covering her face. She glides away toward the village, but not quietly enough; she wakes Momo, and he wakes Aang by jumping on him. \n",
      "AANG: What's the matter, buddy? [Katara leaves Team Avatar.] It's her! [Excited, waves his hand to Katara and puts on his headband.] Hello, Painted Lady Spirit! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara shocked, quickly flees from Aang. Meanwhile, Aang uses his airbending to accelerate his run. The camera moves to a hill as Katara climbs up and continues on as Aang easily keeps up. \n",
      "AANG: [Jumps up the hill.] Excuse me, I don't mean to bother you, but my friend's sick and we're on kind of a tight schedule. [Continues to follow her down the hill as she crosses the river.] Wait! But I'm a great bridge between your world and mine! [Aang freezes some water to form stepping stones to cross the river.] I know Hei Bai! We're close personal friends! [Katara moves faster, and Aang jumps on a wooden bridge. Katara runs out of the river onto the docks and notices Aang's reflection in the water. She looks up and sees Aang running across a roof.] Heeey! [He suddenly hits a pole, Katara flinches and feels sorry for him but continues on across the river to the other side. She stops to look out at the village thinking she is safe but Aang drops in front of her.] My name's Aang. I'm the Avatar. [Lifts his headband and points at his arrow.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Using a disguised voice.] Well, hello Avatar. I wish I could talk, but I am very busy. \n",
      "AANG: Yeah, me too. I hate that. [Looks at Katara's face from behind the veil.] You know, you're really pretty spirit. I don't meet too many spirits, but the ones I do meet, not very attractive. [Looks at Katara suspiciously. Tries to look under the hat.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Giggles nervously.] Thank you, but- \n",
      "AANG: You seem familiar too. \n",
      "KATARA: A lot of people say that. \n",
      "AANG: [Suspicious.] No, you really seem familiar. \n",
      "KATARA: Look, I really should get going. [Covers her face and runs, but Aang uses his airbending and blasts her hat up into the air, exposing her.] \n",
      "AANG: Katara? \n",
      "KATARA: [Guiltily.] Hi, Aang. \n",
      "AANG: [Shocked.] You're the Painted Lady? [Pointing at Katara.] But how? \n",
      "KATARA: I wasn't her at first, I was just trying to help the village. [Takes her hat off.] But since everyone thought that's who I was anyway, I guess I just kinda became her. [Drops her hat on the ground.] \n",
      "AANG: So you've been sneaking out at night? Wait, is Appa even sick? \n",
      "KATARA: He might be sick of the purple berries I've been feeding him, but other than that he's fine! \n",
      "AANG: I can't believe you lied to everyone, so you could help these people. \n",
      "KATARA: I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't have ... \n",
      "AANG: [Happily.] No, I think it's great! You're like a secret hero! \n",
      "KATARA: Well, if you wanna help, there's one more thing I have to do. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang gives her a curious look. Cut to the Fire Nation factory. Aang and Katara run along the river's edge toward it. Aang looks at the polluted water. \n",
      "AANG: You wanna destroy this factory? \n",
      "KATARA: Yes. Sokka was just kidding, but he was right. Getting rid of this factory is the only way to help these people permanently. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang and Katara enter and move to different sides of the factory. Katara uses waterbending to cut the metal hooks that hang barrels of a magma. Aang, with protective gloves on, overturns bigger hanging barrels, smiling at his work. Aang uses earthbending to break apart the pipe system in the factory. Katara bends a huge wave of water through the windows and floods the factory. The scene cuts to outside as the factory explodes from within and muck stops flowing from the pipes. Cut to Aang and Katara walking back to their campsite. Aang laughs and makes explosion noises. \n",
      "KATARA: Shhh! [Quietly.] We don't wanna wake Sokka. [She turns and sees that Sokka and Toph are awake.] Hi, Sokka, we were just out on a morning walk! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Angrily and disappointed.] Oh, really? A morning walk? [Dumps the hay out of Katara's sleeping bag.] I know you're the Painted Lady, I know you've been sneaking out at night, and I know you've been lying about Appa and been feeding him [Sticks out his own tongue.] purpleising tongue berries! [Toph sticks out her tongue and shows that it is purple and holds up a bag of berries which Momo starts eating.] Katara, what you did put our whole mission in jeopardy. We're leaving right now! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara walks past Sokka sadly. Sokka confronts Aang as he follows. \n",
      "SOKKA: And how long did you know about this? \n",
      "AANG: [Defensively.] Hey, I just found out this morning! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang sprints away with airbending. The scene changes to the Fire Nation factory where a man can be seen coming out of the smoke and looking angrily toward the town. Cut to Team Avatar packing, but they pause when they hear buzzing. The factory workers are shown headed for the town on jet skis. Cut to the gang on a cliff looking down at the river below. \n",
      "TOPH: [Approaching and kneeling down with the others.] What's going on? \n",
      "AANG: Fire Nation soldiers are heading toward the village! \n",
      "SOKKA: [To Katara.] What did you do? \n",
      "KATARA: I kind of destroyed their factory. \n",
      "SOKKA: You what? \n",
      "KATARA: [Defensively.] It was your idea! \n",
      "SOKKA: I was joking! I also said to use spirit magic and made funny noises! [Slaps his forehead.] Did you even think this through? The army is gonna blame the villagers! They're headed there right now to get revenge! \n",
      "KATARA: Well, what was I supposed to do? \n",
      "SOKKA: Leave! Do nothing! \n",
      "KATARA: [Angrily.] No, I will never, ever turn my back on people who need me! [Gets up.] I'm going down to that village, and I am gonna do whatever I can. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As Katara walks away, Sokka stops her by putting his hand on her shoulder. \n",
      "SOKKA: Wait! I'm coming, too. \n",
      "KATARA: I thought you didn't want to help. \n",
      "SOKKA: You need me, and I will never turn my back on you. \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka, you really do have a heart. [The two hug.] \n",
      "AANG: [Wiping away tears.] He really does have a heart, doesn't he? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang turns to Toph for confirmation. Toph, however, elbows him and he falls off camera with a thump. Cut to the Fire Nation soldiers on jet skis. Cut to Team Avatar looking at the village. Cut to Mung and his soldiers standing on the dock. \n",
      "MUNG: I thought we could live as neighbors, in peace. But I guess I was wrong. You steal our food, our medicine ... and then you destroy our factory. \n",
      "DOCK/XU: [Pops out of the crowd wearing Dock hat.] We didn't do any of that. [Pops out in a different place wearing his Xu hat.] Yeah, the Painted Lady brought us food. She's the one that healed our sick, not your medicine. \n",
      "MUNG: [Holding a statuette.] Oh, right, the mysterious Painted Lady did it. And I suppose she drew the army emblem on your containers, too. [Throws the statuette at the container, smashing it. The crowd gasps.] This is a town of thieves and liars! [Firebends a blast at a house. Mockingly.] Where's your Painted Lady now? We're going to cure the world of this wretched village. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The soldiers begin demolishing the town. A jet ski, with two soldiers, goes past a dock as a soldier sends a hook and chain toward it. The chain wraps around a log holding up a house and it breaks as the jet ski drives away. The house crumbles into the water. Cut to two soldiers who light a large flammable ball perched on a buoy in the river, but a mysterious gust of wind blows out the fire, twice. \n",
      "MUNG: Light it again! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They follow Mung's command, and it is blown out again. Eerie flute music begins floating over the water. \n",
      "FEMALE.FIRE.NATION.SOLDIER: Look at that! Where's it coming from? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a heavy fog rapidly pouring in. \n",
      "MALE.FIRE.NATION.SOLDIER: I don't know. Something strange is going on. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: An ominous growling noise echoes over the river. \n",
      "LITTLE.BOY: It's the Painted Lady. [Grins slyly. Ominous tone.] She's coming. \n",
      "MUNG: There is no Painted Lady! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A repetitive thudding noise, as of giant footsteps, has begun. Pan over the river to the further bank where we see that the thudding is caused by Toph elevating and dropping a large boulder, while Appa provides the growling. Sokka mans the flute, producing eerie noises. \n",
      "FEMALE.FIRE.NATION.SOLDIER: What is that sound? \n",
      "MALE.FIRE.NATION.SOLDIER: Maybe it is her. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The fog parts dramatically to reveal Katara in full Painted Lady regalia. She pauses a moment and rushes toward the soldiers with a burst of waterbending. She alights on the dock and slowly approaches them. \n",
      "MUNG: Do something! [Pushes his soldiers forward. As they timidly draw near, they are rattled by a blast of airbending. Aang is shown hiding beneath the dock. The two soldiers run off. To the remaining soldiers.] Stand your ground! [Katara waterbends two jet skis into a nearby cliff. As she raises her hand to wreak further damage, the soldiers jump into the remaining jet skis and speed off, leaving Mung.] I'll take care of you myself. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He bends an arc of fire at Katara, we see it advance toward her in slow motion. Aang, still concealed beneath the dock, sends Katara flying into the sky on a column of air; the flame passes harmlessly beneath her. Aang rends the dock in two with a blast of wind, sending Mung flying into the river. As he flounders, Katara rises out of the polluted water before him and raises her arms threateningly. \n",
      "KATARA: Leave this village and never come back. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He swims desperately away from her. A stray jet ski passes by and he clambers into it; the ski buzzes off. Sokka and Toph row toward the village as the people applaud Katara as she returns to the dock. \n",
      "LITTLE.BOY: I knew you'd come. \n",
      "VILLAGER.#1: Thank you! \n",
      "VILLAGER.#2: Painted Lady, you're the best! \n",
      "DOCK: Me and my brothers really owe you a lot. [Looking at her and her faded Painted Lady marks.] Hey, wait a minute! I know you! You're not the Painted Lady, you're that colonial girl! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara places a hand on her face and realizes her make-up is smudged. \n",
      "LITTLE.BOY: Yeah, you're the lady that gave me a fish. \n",
      "DOCK: [Angrily.] You've been tricking us. You're a waterbender! \n",
      "VILLAGER.#3: She's a waterbender! \n",
      "VILLAGER.#4: How dare you act like our Painted Lady! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The crowd surges forward in anger. Sokka runs forward to intervene. \n",
      "SOKKA: Maybe she is a waterbender, but she was just trying to help you. Because of her, that factory won't be polluting your river, and the army is gone. You should be down on your knees thanking her! \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka, it's okay. [She steps forward and moves Sokka back. To the villagers.] I shouldn't have acted like someone I wasn't, and I shouldn't have tricked you. But I felt like I had to do something. It doesn't matter if the Painted Lady is real or not. Because your problems are real, and this river is real. You can't wait around for someone to help you. You have to help yourself. \n",
      "DOCK: She's right, but what should we do? \n",
      "TOPH: [Pops out from behind the little boy's mother and uses a lower voice.] Maybe we can clean the river! \n",
      "DOCK: Yeah, we can clean the river! [The crowd cheers.] Thank you. You know, you're not so bad for a waterbender. \n",
      "SOKKA: You wouldn't mind keeping that a secret, by the way, would you? \n",
      "DOCK: No problem. Keeping my mouth shut is a personal specialty. My brother Xu, on the other hand, ohh, he's a blabbermouth. [Sokka facepalms.] \n",
      "KATARA: So, Dock, are you gonna help us clean? \n",
      "DOCK: No, ma'am. I'm going to get my other brother, Bushi. He loves cleaning rivers. [Dock brazenly switches hats right in front of them.] All right, I'm Bushi! Let's get some river cleaning done! \n",
      "AANG: Aha, I knew it! I knew you were the same guy. You're the shop owner and the boat guy. \n",
      "DOCK: Oh, you must be talking about my brothers, Dock and Xu. \n",
      "AANG: [Annoyed.] No, I just saw you! You switched hats and called yourself a different name! \n",
      "DOCK: [Annoyed.] Oh, you know who does that? My brother, Dock. [Conspiratorial whisper.] He's crazy. [Goes off chuckling.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang fumes in annoyance. Cut to an aerial view of the village with boats in the surrounding river. The shot changes to the boats on the river as the villagers spread clean out the pollutants. Katara bends the water into a large vat while Aang and Toph separate the pollutants using earthbending and putting it in a large boat. Cut to an aerial view of the village as the day passes by and the river becomes cleaner. Cut to Team Avatar's campsite at night. Katara sits on an overlook of the river when suddenly clouds of fog appear and the Painted Lady emerges. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut further away showing the meteor shower above them. They see a big meteor heading for the ground and let out gasps of amazement. \n",

      "KATARA: [Jumps onto Appa's head, taking the reins.] There's a creek over here. I'll bend the water onto the fire. [Signals Appa to take off.] \n",

      "PIANDAO: [Takes the brush and positions it correctly in Sokka's hand. Cut to a wide shot of both.] When you write your name, you stamp the paper with your identity. You must learn to use your sword to stamp your identity on a battlefield. [Sokka holds his sleeve back. Cut to close-up of the ink as Sokka dips the brush in to it.

      "AZULA: Why? \n",

      "AZULA: You're pathetic. \n",
      "MAI: [View from behind Zuko.] I know one thing I care about. [Walks up to Zuko. Frontal view.] I care about you. [They kiss.] \n",
      "AZULA: [Claps. Camera zooms out to show her as Mai and Zuko turn.] Well, those were wonderful performances, everyone. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Frontal view.] I guess you wouldn't understand, would you, Azula? [He puts an arm around Mai.] Because you're just so perfect. \n",
      "AZULA: [Frontal view.] Well, yes, I guess you're right. I don't have sob stories like all of you. I could sit here and complain how our mom liked Zuko more than me, but I don't really care. [Gazes into the fire. Close-up view of the fire pit.] My own mother [Close-up.] thought I was a monster. [Close-up of Zuko and Mai. Close-up of Ty Lee. Side-view of campsite. After a momentary pause.] She was right, of course, but it still hurt. \n",
      "TY.LEE: What Lo and Li said came true. The beach did help us learn about ourselves. [She picks up a rock and rubs it, smiling. Close-up.] I feel all smoothed. I'll always remember this. \n",

      "ROKU: Aang, it's time you learn of my history with Fire Lord Sozin. [Cut to a close-up of Aang's face in his dream, before cutting back to Roku.] You need to understand how the war began, if you want to know how to end it. [Cut to an overhead shot of Roku's island.] Meet me on my home island on the day of the summer solstice. \n",

      "AANG: [Talking in his sleep.] Okay, Roku. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to Zuko, who is asleep as well, as sounds of footsteps wake him up, and he rushes to the hall to investigate. He opens the door, and sees a cloaked individual walk down the hall and disappear. Zuko begins to go after the individual, but notices a scroll lying on the floor. A surprised Zuko picks up the scroll and reads it. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Reading the scroll.] You need to know the story of your great-grandfather's demise. It will reveal your own destiny. [He closes the scroll, and stares down the hallway.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Shot cuts to a view from the opposite end of the hallway. Zuko is still standing outside his bedroom. Scene changes to a blue, cloud filled sky. A very large cloud moves quickly forward. Cut to the inside of the cloud, as Aang, standing on Appa's, bends the elements around the bison to create a cloud, to camouflage. Katara and Sokka look over Appa's saddle for a better look. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to an overhead of the Royal Caldera City. Cut to a hall, full of paintings of previous Fire Lords. Zuko stands before one of the portraits, as Azula passes by Zuko. \n",
      "AZULA: It's never too early for a sitting with the court painter, Zuko. Make sure he gets your good side. \n",
      "ZUKO: Wait, I need to ask you something. [Azula stops walking.] What do you remember about our great-grandfather's history? \n",
      "AZULA: [She sighs.] Oh, Zuko, it's so strange how your mind works. [Cut to an overhead shot of the hall, as Azula tells Zuko about Sozin's history.] Fire Lord Sozin began the war, of course. [Cut to Fire Lord Sozin's portrait, as it pans from the bottom to the top.] He spent his early years secretly preparing for it. He was as patient as he was clever. He famously waited for the comet, later renamed Sozin's Comet, and used its power to launch his full-scale invasion of the world. [Cut back to Zuko and Azula.] In the end, he died a very old and successful man. \n",
      "ZUKO: But how did he die? \n",
      "AZULA: [Turning toward Zuko.] Didn't you pay any attention in school, Zuko? He died peacefully, in his sleep. [Cut to a shot of the full room, as Azula walks away.] He was ancient. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko stares, frustrated. Scene changes back to Roku's island. Team Avatar is sitting on the tip of a hardened wave of lava. Cut to Aang from the back, who is facing the ocean, and is meditating. Cut to him from the front, as his arrows glow, and he is shown sitting on a mountain top, surrounded by clouds, in the Spirit World. Fang, who is carrying Roku, flies near him, as he stands up, and Roku smiles at Aang. The scene cuts to Zuko in his room, lying on his back on his bed. He rolls over on his side and stares at the scroll. He picks it up and reads it to himself again. \n",
      "ZUKO: What does it mean? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Annoyed, he tosses the scroll aside, as it lands on a lantern. The light from the lantern shines through the parchment, and it reveals a secret message on the scroll. Zuko gasps and grabs the scroll from atop the lantern, and reads the secret message aloud. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Reading.] The Fire Sages keep the secret history in the Dragonbone Catacombs. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a close-up of Zuko's eyes, as he finishes reading the secret message. Zuko quickly turns to leave. Cut to a dark temple. A Fire Sage walks through a courtyard, and stops over a large medallion fashioned in the shape of a flower in the middle of the courtyard. He crouches low, and delivers a blast of fire into the center of the medallion. It begins to open a hidden passage, under the courtyard of the temple. The Sage goes into the passage through the steps. Zuko hides and waits behind a pillar. When no one is around, Zuko goes to the secret passage, and bends a blast of fire into the medallion. The passage opens, and a spiral staircase is revealed along with a very large secret chamber. Zuko travels through the chamber and down a hall lined with bones of dragons, all lined up along the walls of the hall. He comes to an ornate door with a metal sculpture of Fire Lord Sozin on it. The chest of the sculpture has a Fire Nation emblem. Zuko places his left hand over the emblem, and bends a fire blast. The fire fills the door, and comes out from the statue's eyes, nose and mouth. Zuko enters the room, pulls his cloak from his head, and raises his lantern to look around the dark chamber, and sees that the room is filled with artifacts and various vessels. A large statue of a dragon sits in the middle of the room. Under the dragon's head, Zuko finds Fire Lord Sozin's history. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Reading aloud.] The final testimony of Fire Lord Sozin. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As Zuko picks the scroll, the scene changes to Roku lending Aang a hand to climb on Fang. \n",
      "ROKU: Come, Aang. \n",
      "AANG: [He climbs on Fang, who flies off.] Where're we going? \n",
      "ROKU: To visit my past. [He smiles at Aang, as Aang grins widely.] Our shared past. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to the room, where Zuko is reading from the scroll. \n",
      "SOZIN: [Narrating his history.] As I feel my own life dimming, I can't help but think of a time when everything was so much brighter. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to a lush Fire Nation courtyard in a flashback. Two young firebenders are dueling. The young men, Prince Sozin and Roku, exchange fire blasts. \n",
      "SOZIN: I remember my friend. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: While they duel, Sozin notices that Roku's feet are close to a tree root. Sozin smiles, and using this to his advantage, he steps up his attack to drive Roku back, causing Roku to trip over the root and fall back. As Roku falls, Sozin grabs Roku by the shirt to keep him from falling. While he holds him, he raises his hand as if to fire blast, but instead he lets Roku fall to the ground. \n",
      "SOZIN: Looks like I win again, Roku. [Extends a hand to help Roku to his feet.] \n",
      "ROKU: Are you kidding? [Takes Sozin's hands and gets up.] The tree root did all the work. [After getting up, he pats Sozin on his shoulders.] Nice one, Sozin. \n",
      "AANG: [Surprised.] You were friends with Fire Lord Sozin‌? \n",
      "ROKU: Back then, he was just Prince Sozin. [Cut to a close-up of Roku's face.] And he was my best friend. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As Roku and Sozin leave the courtyard, a young Fire Nation lady goes by. As she walks past the friends, Roku stares at her and blushes, which Sozin notices. \n",
      "SOZIN: [Nudging Roku.] Say something to her. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Roku walks after the young lady. He raises his hand and attempts to greet the lady, who also slightly blushes, but is overcome by embarrassment. He sighs, puts his hands on his head, and falls down. Sozin sits down next to him and sprinkles blades of grass on Roku's face. Shot cuts to the older Roku and Aang, watching Roku's history. \n",
      "ROKU: Love is hard when you are young. \n",
      "AANG: You don't have to tell me. \n",
      "ROKU: [Putting his hand over Aang's shoulder.] Don't worry, it gets better. [He turns back and walks, along with Aang.] Now, come with me. [Cut to a celebration on a courtyard.] We have a party to attend. \n",
      "AANG: Wait, whose party is it? \n",
      "ROKU: [Cut to the young Roku and Prince Sozin.] Sozin and I shared many things, including a birthday. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Roku and Prince Sozin walk down from the stairs. As they walk down the stairs, the camera focuses on two young women in the crowd, one of whom is the lady whom Roku has a crush on, Ta Min. She looks at Roku, before looking down and blushes. Her friend leans over her shoulder and giggles. Roku notices the lady and blushes, while he continues down the stairs. Distracted, Roku falls down the stairs, but Sozin quickly grabs Roku by the hand. Roku composes himself and blushes again from embarrassment, as Sozin laughs at his friend. The crowd suddenly grows quiet, as a group of Fire Sages enter the courtyard. They walk toward Prince Sozin and Roku, as Sozin hurries down the stairs to meet them. \n",
      "SOZIN: Did something happen to my father? \n",
      "FIRE.SAGE: No, Prince Sozin. We are not here for you. [Shot cuts to the Fire Sage talking.] We're here to announce the identity of the next Avatar. [The crowd whispers, as the shot cut to Roku and Sozin, both in shock. Cut again to a close-up of the Sages. The Sages bow to the new Avatar.] It is our honor to serve you, Avatar Roku. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a close-up of Roku, standing with his jaw dropped, bewildered. The camera shows the crowd on the ground, all bowing. Sozin, who is still in shock himself, looks around at the crowd, and quickly turns to kneel before Roku. Scene changes to Zuko sitting in the chamber, reading Sozin's history. \n",
      "SOZIN: Soon the day came when my friend Roku had to leave the Fire Nation and face his destiny as the Avatar. [Cut to a close-up of Zuko's face, as he reads.] He needed to travel the world so he could master the other elements. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to a close-up of a young Roku from the side, sitting in his room, with a dejected look on his face, as Prince Sozin stands near the doorway. \n",
      "SOZIN: Hey, why aren't you packed yet, all-powerful Avatar? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Roku does not respond to his friend's question, and continues to stare down. Sozin looks down sympathetically. Suddenly, he smiles. \n",
      "SOZIN: [Sozin leaps in the room, attempting to demonstrate examples of all the bending disciplines.] Come on, show me how it's done using all four kinds of bending. \n",
      "ROKU: I started packing, but then the Fire Sages told me I won't need any worldly possessions anymore. \n",
      "SOZIN: Oh. [He sits down near Roku.] \n",
      "ROKU: It happened so fast. Everything's gonna be different now. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a shot of the two friends from the side, as Sozin removes his Crown Prince headpiece and gives it to Roku. \n",
      "SOZIN: Here, hope you're at least allowed to have this. [Shot cuts to a close-up of the headpiece.] \n",
      "ROKU: But this is a royal artifact. [Cut to a shot of the friends from behind.] It's supposed to be worn by the Crown Prince. \n",
      "SOZIN: I want you to have it. \n",

Aang moves to a squat and begins to groan, before smiling with relief. Cut back to the siblings, with Katara looking more disturbed than before. \n",
      "KATARA: Do they have bathrooms in the Spirit World? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Raises his forefinger.] As a matter of fact, they do not. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Shot cuts to show the Patola Mountains with the Southern Air Temple in the distance. Fang flies through the mountain range. \n",
      "ROKU: It was the place where I was trained to master airbending. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a line of young Air Nomad monks. The camera pans right to show Avatar Roku at the end of the line. Roku is airbending his long black hair at another young monk's face, who, irritated, bends it back at Roku. Roku responds by nudging the monk with his shoulder. \n",

      "AANG: No way! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to an aerial shot of the airbenders on a grassy ledge. An older Air Nomad leads the students, and launches off the side of the ledge. The students line up by twos to follow their teacher. Cut to Gyatso and Roku soaring through the air on their gliders. \n",

      "GYATSO: [Laughing.] Check this out! [He flips himself over and stands on top of his glider. Cut to Aang and Roku.] \n",
      "AANG: He's air surfing! I can't believe I never thought of that. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut back to Gyatso, as he loses his balance on the glider, but as he falls, Roku catches him on the back of his glider. Roku is unable to control the glider, and the both go down toward the other young monks, who are now back on the grassy ledge.

      "AANG: [Smiling and surprised.] That's amazing! I can't believe you were friends with Monk Gyatso just like I was! \n",

      "ROKU: After my years mastering airbending, I traveled to the Northern Water Tribe. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Roku's waterbending master, who bends a large water drill from the ocean waters behind him. It thrusts forward, knocking Roku, and a part of the plateau, into the water. \n",

      "ROKU: ... And a lifelong friend. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As Sud comes to the finishing point, quickly brings his landmass to a halt. He thrusts his fists into the air, cheering for himself. The look on his face changes quickly to shock when he realizes that Roku not only beat him to the top, but he also had enough time to seat himself and pour them both tea. Cut back to Sud as he smiles at his pupil. Cut to a side shot of Roku and Sud. They both drink from their teacups. Scene changes to a close-up of Roku's head dress and slowly pans down to show his face in an extreme close-up. \n",

      "ROKU: [Putting his arm over Sozin's shoulder.] Sozin, it is my wedding! Have a cookie, dance with someone, lighten up! \n",
      "SOZIN: [Smiling slightly.] I know, I know, but just hear me out. [Roku bows in agreement. Cut to a shadowed side-shot of the balcony as they walk.] Right from the start, I was destined to be Fire Lord. And although we didn't always know it, you were destined to be the Avatar. [Cut to a close-up side-shot of the two. Roku stops as Sozin continues on.] It's an amazing stroke of fate we know each other so well, isn't it? Together, we could do ... anything. \n",
      "ROKU: [The camera pans toward Roku. Now serious.] Yeah, we could. \n",
      "SOZIN: [Cut to a shot of the Fire Nation from the balcony.] Our nation is enjoying an unprecedented time of peace and wealth. Our people are happy, and we're so fortunate in so many ways. \n",
      "ROKU: [Concerned.] Where are you going with this? \n",
      "SOZIN: I've been thinking, we should share this prosperity with the rest of the world. [Cut to a shocked Roku with the camera closing in on him.] In our hands is the most successful empire in history. [Back to a close-up of Sozin.] It's time we expanded it. \n",
      "ROKU: No! The four nations are meant to be just that: four. \n",
      "SOZIN: [Cut to Sozin.] Roku, you haven't even stopped to consider the possibilities. \n",
      "ROKU: [Cut to a close-up side-shot of Roku.] There are no possibilities. This is the last I want to hear [Closes his eyes.] about this. [He walks away from the balcony, with an angry expression on his face.] \n",
      "ROKU: [His spirit speaks to Aang.] That was my first real test as the Avatar. Unfortunately, it was many years before I learned [Cut to a extreme close-up of Sozin.] that Sozin [Sozin narrows his eyes. Fade to a back-shot of Fang flying with Roku.] had gone ahead with his plan, despite my warning. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to Roku flying over a body of water on Fang, as he approaches land.

      "SOZIN: [Cut to Sozin, as Roku walks up to him.] How dare you, a citizen of the Fire Nation, address your Fire Lord this way. [Cut to a close-up of Sozin's face from the side.] Your loyalty is to our nation first. Anything less makes you a traitor. \n",
      "ROKU: Don't do this, Sozin. Don't challenge me. It will only end badly. It's over. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As Roku turns back and starts to leave, Sozin, full of rage, jumps from his throne and delivers an immensely powerful fire stream. As the flames go out, Roku is nowhere to be seen. Sozin widens his eyes in suprise, expression becoming blank as he looks around. Suddenly, Roku bursts from the ground behind Sozin, revealing that he has burrowed into the ground with earthbending to defend from Sozin's attack. Before Sozin can turn back, Roku delivers a powerful air blast at the Fire Lord, which causes him to slam on the gates of the room. As Sozin falls down, Roku immediately earthbends a pillar of earth that lifts Sozin into the air and pins him by the back of his robes to the ceiling.

Roku airbends an air spout, and raises himself to Sozin. \n",
      "ROKU: I'm sparing you, Sozin. [Cut to a frontal shot of Roku.] I'm letting you go in the name of our past friendship. But I warn you. [Cut to a extreme close up of Roku.] Even a single step out of line will result in your permanent end. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sozin stares at Roku, his face still full of anger. Suddenly, his expression drops, and he hangs his head in defeat. Roku turns, and rides the cyclone quickly away from Sozin. Scene changes to an aerial shot of Roku's island at night. \n",
      "ROKU: Sozin and I didn't speak or see each other for twenty-five years after our battle. [Cut to Roku's house.] I spent most of my spare time here, at my home. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to an overhead shot of an elderly Roku and Ta Min sleeping, as a loud noise awakes Roku and he leaps out from the bed, and looks through the window. Cut to a shot of the window, as large fireballs falling from the sky, and crashing into the island. Roku and his wife flee the room, but as they do so, Roku's headpiece falls to the floor, and is left behind. Roku emerges from the house to find the air filled with smoke and ash. Coughing, Roku and his wife shield their faces. A worried Roku looks at the erupting volcano in the island. \n",
      "ROKU: Let's go! [He catches his wife's hand, and airbends smoke and ash in their way, creating a path, as both run through the path he created.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to the town, as the townspeople run through the streets to escape the waves of smoke and ash that now pour through the streets. Cut to Roku's home, as Fang flies up from behind the house. He narrowly escapes as an ash flow completely buries the house. Cut to a wide shot of Roku, with his face covered, leading his wife and many townspeople to safety. Ash continues to fall as we see a swell of lava ooze from the mouth of the volcano. Cut to a close-up of Roku still running. He looks to his wife, as shot cuts to her running. He lets go of her hand, and motions her to go on without him. With her arm still outstretched, she looks at him, and runs to safety. She continues to look back, desperately hoping Roku will grab her hand. Ta Min runs off with many of the townspeople. Roku turns to face the advancing smoke, and airbends a huge dome of protection around himself. Cut to the townspeople in boats, as they see the air dome. Cut to the worried faces of the people, including Ta Min. Scene changes to the volcano erupting in the island from the Fire Nation palace, as camera zooms back to show an elderly Fire Lord Sozin watching from his balcony. \n",
      "SOZIN: Roku's island was a hundred miles away. But I could still feel it rumbling and see the black plume of smoke. I had never seen anything like this catastrophe. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Sozin's face, before cutting to an aerial shot of the volcano. Large columns of black smoke billow from the summit, as lightning strikes above the volcano and the earth rumbles from the disaster. Cut to a close-up of a landslide quickly approaching the town, destroying it completely. Roku earthbends a gigantic wall, and rides the wall to meet the falling earth, and stop it. As he succeeds in stopping it, the volcano ejects a massive wave of lava. The flow breeches the wall of earth, causing Roku to flee to the bottom of the summit. He cuts into the earth using his earthbending, creating a channel to divert the lava into the surrounding ocean, away from the town. Cut to an aerial shot of the island, as the channel fills with lava, and empties into the ocean. Cut to Roku and Aang watching the destruction from a distance. \n",
      "AANG: This is amazing, Roku! You're battling a volcano, and you're winning. \n",
      "ROKU: Unfortunately, my success didn't last long, Aang. There was no way I could do it all. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Shot cuts to Roku looking up the top of the volcano. As the camera pans up and focuses on the mouth of the volcano, it violently expels another giant wave of lava. Roku runs toward the volcano, and leaps. Roku blows a powerful blast of air from his mouth at the lava, which cools and hardens, as Roku lands on it. Suddenly, a blast of poisonous gas spouts to his right, he turns and covers his face. He turns to the jet, airbending it away. Suddenly lava appears on his right, which he airbends, and quickly another jet of gases blasts to his left, and he quickly airbends it as well. \n",
      "ROKU: [To Aang.] Battling the elements was hard enough. I had to do it while I could barely breathe. The poisonous, volcanic gases were overwhelming. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to an overhead shot of the sky directly over the eruption. Lightning crashes around the crater as Fang comes, flying. The summit emits another lava fountain. Fang pulls back, narrowly escaping the blast, and roars. \n",
      "ROKU: [Airbends a jet of gases.] It's all right Fang! [Coughs.] Get out of here! I'm fine! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Roku turns his body from side to side, and enters the Avatar State. With a powerful blow from his fist, Roku earthbends a tremor through the volcano, breaking out the back side of the crater, which lessens the lava flow. As the lava flows down, the second volcano erupts, as Roku, no longer in the Avatar State, hopelessly drops his head. Cut to a view of Roku from behind, as Sozin, on a blue dragon, appears. \n",
      "SOZIN: Need a hand, old friend? \n",
      "ROKU: [A surprised Roku turns back.] Sozin? \n",
      "SOZIN: There's not a moment to waste. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to an aerial view of the two volcanoes. Sozin and Roku ride on the Fire Lord's dragon's back to the second volcano. Cut to Roku bending the fire fountain down into the crater. Cut to Sozin balanced on the mouth of the vent, as he cools the lava by absorbing the heat, passing it through himself, and redirects out through his other hand. The scene pans out to show the silhouettes of the two friends, controlling the disaster. Cut to the townspeople in the boats, as they see the volcanoes erupting. Cut to a shot of Ta Min, with an anxious expression on her face. The scene cuts back to Roku and Sozin on the edge of the crater. Lightning blasts above Sozin, as the earth beneath him becomes unstable. He begins to fall back off the side of the volcano, but Roku quickly earthbends an earth shelf to catch Sozin. Stable again, Sozin looks to Roku for a moment. Suddenly, the earth violently shakes and another surge of ash and rock shoot from the crater, and the two turn to run. \n",
      "ROKU: Don't breathe the toxic gas. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As the two run, a jet of toxic gas shoots up directly next to Sozin. Roku quickly airbends it away to protect Sozin. Suddenly gas erupts directly into Roku's face, causing him to be disoriented. \n",
      "ROKU: [Shaking, Cut to Roku's point of view. He lifts his hands to look at them, as they blur out of focus.] It's too much. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Overwhelmed by the poisons, Roku falls to his knees. He looks up toward Sozin, and holds out his hand for help. \n",
      "ROKU: Please. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Roku's point of view again. \n",
      "SOZIN: Without you, all my plans are suddenly possible. [Cut to Roku.] I have a vision for the future, Roku. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sozin's dragon appears. As Roku kneels, Sozin mounts the dragon and flies away. Cut to Roku, on the side of the volcano. He is surrounded by toxic gas, and behind him a surge of rock and ash flows swiftly toward him. Cut to a shot of the black clouds billowing from the island, as Sozin's dragon emerges from the plumes. The camera zooms to an extreme close-up of Sozin's eye. Shot cuts to Roku, from the back, still on his knees. He is coughing, and is unable to get to his feet. Fang appears from the right, and flies above him. Cut to a close-up of Roku from the side, as he looks up toward his dragon. Cut to an aerial view of the debris, rapidly approaching Avatar Roku. With the rock avalanche just moments away from swallowing Roku, Fang flies down, and wraps himself around Roku. The wave of ash and rubble cover the two completely, killing both of them. Fade to a bright light, as the camera pans to show an arched window frame. A baby's cries can be heard. The camera pans down to show a smiling born infant. \n",
      "AANG: Who's ... wait, that's me, isn't it? [Cut to a long shot of three Air Nomads. A nun holds up the baby to the light while two people, presumably the infant's parents, stand in the shadows.] \n",
      "ROKU: Make sense of our past, Aang. [Cut to Roku and Aang.] And you will bring peace, and restore balance in the world. [He slowly disappears.] \n",
      "AANG: Roku? Roku! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang walks out of the flashback into whiteness as the scene changes to Zuko reading in the Dragonbone Catacombs. \n",
      "SOZIN: With Roku gone, and the great comet returning, the timing was perfect to change the world. [Cut to Sozin, standing on a balcony, from the behind, looking at his soldiers and the Fire Navy ships.] I knew the next Avatar would be born an Air Nomad. So I wiped out the Air Temples. [Scene changes to a burning temple. The camera slowly fades into an extreme close-up of Sozin's face.] But somehow, the new Avatar eluded me. [Scene changes to Fire Navy ships searching in the polar regions.] I wasted the remainder of my life searching in vain. [Cut to underside of the ship.] I know he's hiding out there somewhere. [Camera pans below to show the iceberg Aang was trapped in.] The Fire Nation's greatest threat ... the last airbender. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to a close-up of the scroll Zuko is reading. \n",
      "ZUKO: That can't be it! Where's the rest of it? [He searches the scroll to find more information.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko puts the scroll down and stands up, as the camera pans out. Scene changes to the Fire Nation prison, where Iroh is imprisoned. Cut to Zuko from the behind, slamming the door to the cell behind him as he enters. Cut to Iroh sitting with his head down. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Angrily.] You sent this, didn't you? I found the secret history, which by the way should be renamed history most people already know! The note said that I needed to know about my great-grandfather's death, but he was still alive in the end. \n",
      "IROH: [Looking up at Zuko.] No, he wasn't. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Confused.] What are you talking about? \n",
      "IROH: You have more than one great-grandfather, Prince Zuko. Sozin was your father's grandfather. [Cut to a bewildered Zuko.] Your mother's grandfather was Avatar Roku. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Shocked.] Why are you telling me this? \n",
      "IROH: Because understanding the struggle between your two great-grandfathers can help you better understand the battle within yourself. [Zuko sits down, with his head facing down.] Evil and good are always at war inside you, Zuko. It is your nature, your legacy. But, there is a bright side. [Zuko looks up.] What happened generations ago can be resolved now, by you. Because of your legacy, you alone can cleanse the sins of our family and the Fire Nation. Born in you, along with all the strife, is the power to restore balance to the world. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a bundle inside of a brick wall. Iroh removes a brick and reaches for the bundle. Cut to Iroh slowly unwrapping the bundle, revealing the once-lost headdress, while he walks toward Zuko. \n",
      "IROH: This is a royal artifact. It's supposed to be worn [Zuko stands.] by the Crown Prince. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko takes the headdress from Iroh's hand, and holds the artifact, as the shot cuts to Zuko from the behind, standing outside of Iroh's cell. Iroh stands quietly, looking at his nephew. Cut to a shot of the hardened lava wave the gang had been sitting on. Cut to a shot of Sokka, Katara, and Toph all facing Aang as the camera pans down. \n",
      "KATARA: You mean, after all Roku and Sozin went through together, even after Roku showed him mercy, Sozin betrayed him like that‌? \n",
      "TOPH: [Cut to Toph.] It's like these people are born bad. \n",
      "AANG: [Cut to Aang from the side, with Sokka standing near him.] No, that's wrong. I don't think that was the point of what Roku showed me at all. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Shrugging.] Then what was the point? \n",
      "AANG: [Cut to Katara, Toph and Sokka from the behind, as Aang speaks.] Roku was just as much Fire Nation as Sozin was, right? If anything, their story proves anyone's capable of great good and great evil. [Cut to an aerial shot of the hardened lava wave.] Everyone, even the Fire Lord and the Fire Nation have to be treated like they're worth giving a chance. [Shot cuts to a close-up of Aang's face.] And I also think it was about friendships. \n",
      "TOPH: [Camera pans to Toph, and cuts to a close-up of her face.] Do you really think friendships can last more than one lifetime? \n",
      "AANG: [Catching Toph's hand.] I don't see why not. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara catches Toph's other hand. \n",
      "SOKKA: Well, scientifically speaking, there's no way to prove that ... \n",
      "KATARA: [Annoyed.] Oh, Sokka, just hold hands. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka stops talking, and without moving, he thrusts out his hand to hold Katara's. Shot cuts to an aerial shot of Team Avatar, holding hands, and looking out toward the ocean. Fade to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens in Fire Fountain City, where a giant statue of Fire Lord Ozai roaring is shown with flames coming from the fists and out of the mouth. The camera moves down to Toph, who is seen running from someone, but turns around and is caught with a net and falls to the ground. She angrily looks in front of her at someone. \n",
      "TOPH: [Angrily.] How could you do this to me? You betrayed me! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera cuts to a shot of Katara, who is glaring back at Toph. \n",
      "KATARA: [Crosses her arms.] You brought this on yourself. I had no choice. [Turns away from Toph with her arms folded.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph is dragged away in the net, all the while glaring back at Katara. The screen fades to three days earlier. Toph and Katara are seen facing each other, each taking a fighting stance, the latter controlling two streams of water in her hands. Aang appears on the screen, tying his headband over his eyes like a blindfold. \n",
      "AANG: Okay. I'm ready for some training. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He turns to face the girls and takes two steps forward in a stance similar to Toph's. Upon impact with the second step, he picks up vibrations from the ground with seismic sense. He quickly dodges three earth pillars that appear out of the ground near him. He hears a water attack coming from Katara and redirects it at her. He quickly launches a boulder at Toph who catches it and stops it. \n",
      "TOPH: Good job, Twinkle Toes. Visualize, then attack. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She launches the boulder back at Aang, who burrows into a hole with earthbending. The boulder instead hits Katara square in the chest, knocking her down. She stands back up and brushes dust off of her. \n",
      "KATARA: Maybe you should take your own advice, Toph! \n",
      "TOPH: What's the matter? Can't handle a little dirt, Madame Fussy-Britches? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara's eyebrow twitches and she glares at Toph with her vein shown on her head before she angrily creates a wave and sends it at Toph, who gets splashed by it and becomes annoyed. \n",
      "KATARA: Oh, sorry. Did I splash you, Mud-Slug? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara creates an ice ramp, and Toph creates an earth ramp, both proceeding to head straight for each other. They crash and both of the girls go flying. \n",
      "AANG: Are we taking a break? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Meanwhile, Sokka is seen hiding behind Aang with an evil smile. He quickly gets up and charges at Aang. The background changes to a rushing one. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Screaming.] Sneak Attack! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang, casually and still looking away from Sokka, creates an earth wall, which stops Sokka dead in his tracks. He lowers the wall, which causes Sokka to fall down. \n",
      "AANG: [While raising his blindfold and turning to face Sokka.] Sokka, sneak attacks don't work if you yell it out loud. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara and Toph are seen wrestling in a puddle of mud. \n",
      "TOPH: Hungry for a mud pie? [Kicks mud in Katara's face.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Wiping mud off of her face.] I'll give you a mud pie! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara waterbends a stream of mud at Toph, knocking her down. She quickly gets up and earthbends a pillar underneath Katara, which sends her flying toward a wall. She starts running toward Katara, but stops at the last second when they hear Aang. \n",
      "AANG: Uh guys, I thought we were supposed to be training me. \n",
      "KATARA: [Takes a few steps forward, covered in mud; calmly.] Very well, pupil. I believe we've had enough training for today. [Turns and walks away.] \n",
      "TOPH: While Katara cleans up, [Earthbends the mud off of herself and runs toward Aang and Sokka.] let's go have some fun! \n",
      "AANG: Yeah! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Simultaneously with Aang.] Yes! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang, Sokka and Toph head to Fire Fountain City. Sokka is carrying his sword horizontally across his shoulders. He looks up and sees messenger hawks flying in and out of a large coop. \n",
      "SOKKA: Look at all those messenger hawks! You know, I've been thinking about getting one for myself. That way, I wouldn't have to talk to anyone. I could just send them messages. \n",
      "TOPH: I gotta say, I like the idea of not talking to you. [Sokka glares at her.] \n",
      "AANG: [While holding up a silver piece.] So, guys. What are we gonna get with our last silver piece? \n",
      "TOPH: [Stops walking.] We can get more money. [They both look back at her.] Right there. [Points to an area beneath them. Aang and Sokka move back to look where she is pointing.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: In the area is a table with two men sitting across from each other, with people around them watching the action. The table has three shells on it, all upside down. The first man places some money on the table and the second man, a scam artist, lifts the shells to reveal that the middle one has a rock underneath it. He places the shells back down as they were and starts moving them around. \n",
      "TOPH: This is where you seeing people are at a disadvantage. Everyone guesses wrong because the dealer moves the rock at the last minute. But I can feel it with my earthbending. [As she says this, the scam artist continues to move the shells around as the gambler tries to focus on the shell with the rock, and right before stopping, the scam artist quickly and inconspicuously earthbends the rock from underneath one of the shells into his sleeve.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scam artist stops moving the shells and arranges them how they originally were: Horizontally right in front of him. The gambler points at the shell in the middle, which the scam artist lifts to reveal nothing underneath. The gambler stands up and walks away crying. A few more people move and the dealer notices Toph, and that she is blind. \n",
      "DEALER: [To Toph.] You there. Wanna play a friendly game? \n",
      "TOPH: How can I possibly play? [Waves her hand in front of her face.] I'm blind. \n",
      "DEALER: You don't have to see to be lucky. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph sits in front of the table and feels around it, pretending to be helpless. She places their last silver piece on the table. The scam artist shows the rock under the shell in the middle and starts moving them around. This time, he tosses one rock from his sleeves into each of the two empty shells. Toph senses this and smiles slyly. When he stops, Toph points to the one on her left, which has a rock underneath, winning about two silver pieces. \n",
      "AANG: Flamey-O, Toph. \n",
      "DEALER: Wow. Fancy guessing. You are amazing at this. [Plays with a few silver pieces in his hands.] Would you like to make the game a little more interesting? \n",
      "TOPH: [Curiously.] More interesting? How? \n",
      "DEALER: [Points at Sokka's sword.] Well, let's say you toss in your friend's fine sword there, [Grabs a big bag of money.] then I'll put up twenty silver pieces against it, and that's more interesting. \n",
      "TOPH: [Grabs Sokka's sword.] I'll do it for forty silver pieces. [Sokka stares at them with his mouth wide open.] \n",
      "DEALER: Forty silver pieces it is. [Drops some more money into the bag and starts moving the shells, faster this time.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scam artist moves the first two rocks into his sleeves, which Toph senses as she smiles slyly again. He attempts to do the same with the third rock, but Toph inconspicuously clutches her fist, causing the rock to move back underneath the shell, which the scam artist does not notice. When he stops, she smiles and points at the shell in the middle. \n",
      "DEALER: [Moves his hand over to the shell, about to lift it.] Sorry, little lady, but- [Lifts up the shell and sees the rock, which shocks and confuses him.] Huh? [Stares closely at the rock.] \n",
      "TOPH: I won! [She grabs the bag of money, and Sokka grabs his sword as they run off.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Toph, Aang, and Sokka heading back to camp, laughing and carrying baskets full of goods. Katara is seen cooking something in a pot as they all drop their baskets onto the ground and Katara looks at the baskets with curiosity. \n",
      "KATARA: Where did you guys get the money to buy all this stuff? \n",
      "AANG: Toph got us money. [Grabs an apple and takes a bite out of it as he sits down.] She scammed one of those guys in town who moves the shells around all sneaky-like. [He mimics the scam artist moving the shells with his hand. Katara's expression shows disapproval.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sits down too.] She used earthbending to win the game! Classic! \n",
      "KATARA: Ah, so she cheated. \n",
      "TOPH: [Starts to bite her apple, but stops to defend herself.] Hey! I only cheated because he was cheating! [Smiles.] I cheated a cheater. [Closes her eyes in confidence.] What's wrong with that? \n",
      "KATARA: I'm just saying this isn't something we should make a habit of doing. \n",
      "TOPH: Why? Because it's fun? And you hate fun? \n",
      "KATARA: I don't hate fun! [Places Momo on her head like a hat while grinning unconvincingly.] See? Fun! [Momo slips off her head, screeches at her, and runs away.] \n",
      "AANG: [Stands up.] Katara, [Slightly lifts his headband to reveal his airbender tattoo and bows.] I'll personally make you an Avatar Promise that we won't make a habit of doing these scams. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera switches to the city, where Aang goes from bowing to doing tricks with the money in his hands and runs off. A few citizens are seen playing a dice like game. The two winners see Toph holding a bag of money and call her over. She tosses the two die. One lands on three, which is the highest number, and the other is about to go from three to zero. Cut to Toph, who twitches her head to the left slightly without any of the others seeing, causing the die to move back to the three, meaning she wins much to the winners' dismay and Sokka's and Aang's joy.\n",
      "Cut to an area where a carnival is being hosted, where a big man tries a test-your-strength game, in which you need to use a hammer to launch a ball up to ring the bell, but can only make it about halfway. Toph jiggles a bag of money and walks over. Aang and Sokka watch from behind as she hands the man in charge of the game the money and places her hands on the hammer. She struggles to move it over her head and behind her, which makes all in the crowd snicker and laugh. Toph smiles again as she uses earthbending to launch the hammer's head from behind her to the lever with great force. The ball is launched so hard that it launches out of the game, destroying the top of it, which leaves everyone shocked. She casually grabs her winnings and leaves as the ball crashes into a tent behind, causing everyone to cringe at the sound, and looks back to see the damage.\n",
      "The camera next cuts to a street where a carriage is being pulled by a dragon moose. Cut to a side-shot of the inside of the carriage where a noble opens his cup of tea to his delight and waves the aroma to his face. Toph emerges from a dark alley and creates a small rock right in front of one of the wheels to stop the cart. She falls back, pretending to have been hit. The noble peeks outside the carriage window and sees Toph. He jumps out of the carriage and starts to run, but is stopped by what looks like a Fire Nation guard, who is really Sokka in his Wang Fire costume. He notices Toph being \"run over\" and crosses his arms angrily at the noble, who gets on his knees and begs Sokka. He places twelve small bags of money as bribery, one after another in Sokka's arms, and Sokka smiles and winks at him to assure him that Sokka will keep this secret. The camera cuts to back at camp. \n",
      "KATARA: Guys, I think these scams have gone far enough. If you keep doing them, something bad is gonna happen. \n",
      "TOPH: Could you for once stop being such a sourpuss and just lighten up? [Tosses some money to Katara.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Angrily.] Oh, I'm sorry! You think I should be more like you? Like some wild child? [Tosses the money back at Toph.] \n",
      "TOPH: Yeah! Maybe! Maybe then you'd see [Sokka grabs the money off the ground.] how great we have it! I mean, look at us! [Leans back on the rock behind her and crosses her arms behind her head.] We're traveling around the world! Making easy money! Having fun! With no parents to tell us what to do! \n",
      "KATARA: Ah. I see. You're acting like this because of your parents. \n",
      "TOPH: Whatever. \n",
      "KATARA: They were controlling over you, so you ran away, and now you act like your parents don't exist. You act like you hate them, but you don't. You just feel guilty. \n",
      "TOPH: I do hate them. \n",
      "KATARA: I don't think so. I think you miss them, but you just don't wanna deal with that, so instead you act like this crazy person. \n",
      "TOPH: [Stands up; angrily.] Look, I ran away to help Aang! \n",
      "KATARA: You know what? It doesn't matter. These scams put us all at risk, and we don't need that. [Points at her forehead.] We've already got some third-eyed freak after us. \n",
      "SOKKA: Speaking of that \"third-eyed freak\", I think I've come up with a name for him. What do you think of \"Sparky-Sparky-Boom Man\"? [Silence.] Just think about it. \n",
      "KATARA: [Angrily.] We have enough money! You need to stop this! \n",
      "TOPH: [Angrily.] I'll stop when I wanna stop and not when you tell me! [Uses earthbending to launch the bag of money behind her into her hand and walks away angrily. Katara shakes her head angrily as Toph sits and creates an earth tent.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Grabs his bag of money and his sword and stands up.] Speaking of money, I'm off to spend some. See you guys later. [Walks away.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: In town, Sokka just bought a messenger hawk, which he names Hawky. \n",
      "SOKKA: Hawky, welcome to Team Avatar. My name's Sokka, and I'm your new owner, and as such I should warn you that there's already a lemur in our group, so I don't wanna see any fighting. [Scratches Hawky on the stomach.] Good little messenger hawky. Who's got pretty feathers? [While walking away, he notices a wanted poster he had just past with Toph's picture on it. He gasps in horror and rips it off the wall. Hawky screeches.] You're right, Hawky. This is bad. [Suddenly, the bird poops while standing on Sokka's arm.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to back at camp. Katara and Aang are practicing waterbending, while Toph is counting her money. Sokka walks up to her. \n",
      "SOKKA: Toph, while I was in town, I found something that you're not gonna like. [Pulls out the wanted poster and shows it to her.] \n",
      "TOPH: Well it sounds like a sheet of paper, but I guess you're referring to what's on the sheet of paper. \n",
      "SOKKA: It's a wanted poster. Of you. They've nicknamed you the Runaway. \n",
      "TOPH: [Happily.] A wanted poster! That's so great! \"The Runaway.\" I love my new nickname. Is there a picture of me? Does it look good? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Looks a few times at both the wanted poster and Toph.] Well yeah, actually, it does look pretty good. [Gets back on topic.] But, Toph, you're missing the point. Maybe Katara was right. These scams are drawing too much attention to us. \n",
      "TOPH: Don't be such a worrywart like your sister. [Stands up and walks up to Sokka.] Think of it this way: Now you've got plenty of money to help with the invasion plan. [Holds up a bag of money and jiggles it in front of him.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Ponders for a moment.] Well, that is true. I had this idea of making armor for Appa. [Looks at Appa, who is napping, but opens one eye upon hearing this.] \n",
      "TOPH: [Takes some money out of the bag and hands the money to him.] Here's a little extra, so you can get yourself a nice map of the Fire Nation. You know what? [Gives the entire bag to him.] Make it an atlas. \n",
      "SOKKA: [While taking the bag.] I do like expensive atlases. \n",
      "TOPH: Of course you do. [Grabs the wanted poster and tucks it into her outfit.] And that's why this wanted poster is going to stay our little secret. [Walks away.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang and Katara walk up to Sokka, who tucks his new money into his outfit \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka, [Places her hand on her face; annoyed.] tell me you didn't buy a bird. \n",
      "SOKKA: Not just a bird, a messenger bird. Now we can send messages all over the world. Even to Gran Gran. \n",
      "AANG: [Excited.] Wow, how does it work? \n",
      "SOKKA: Hm. Uh, I never actually thought about that. Hawky, [Points away from himself.] Gran Gran, South Pole. [Hawky shakes himself.] I think he gets it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo appears on Aang's shoulder and screeches at Hawky. He jumps to Sokka and starts chasing Hawky around Sokka's head. \n",
      "SOKKA: Hawky! Make nice! Bad Hawky! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Later on at camp, Katara is mixing something in a cooking pot via waterbending. She waterbends some of it out of the pot and into Appa's mouth, which causes him to lick his lips, while Aang sits on a ledge in front of Appa and drinks something out of a cup. Toph and Sokka, the latter with Hawky on his shoulder, show up carrying big bags of money. \n",
      "KATARA: [Sarcastically.] Well. Look who decided to join us. [Stands up.] Where have you two been? Off scamming again? \n",
      "TOPH: Yes, we were. [Puts her bag down.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Slides to the right to behind Toph.] And I suppose you don't think what you're doing is dangerous at all? \n",
      "TOPH: No, I don't. \n",
      "KATARA: Really? \n",
      "TOPH: Yes. Really. \n",
      "KATARA: [Starts to pull something out.] Well then. What's this? [Shows Toph her wanted poster.] \n",
      "TOPH: [Annoyed.] I don't know! I mean, seriously! What is with you people? I'm blind! [Points at her eyes and pulls down her bottom eyelids to emphasize her words.] \n",
      "KATARA: It's a wanted poster of you! \"The Runaway!\" Is that what you're called now? Are you proud of this? \n",
      "TOPH: [Angrily.] Where did you get that!? \n",
      "KATARA: It doesn't matter where I got it. The fact is- \n",
      "TOPH: You went through my stuff! You had no right! \n",
      "KATARA: Your stuff was messy and I was just straightening up, and I happened to stumble across it! \n",
      "TOPH: That's a lie! [Points at her.] You're lying, Katara! \n",
      "KATARA: [Cut to a surprised Katara who glares at Toph. Pushes Toph's pointing hand out of her face.] Fine! It's a lie! But you've been so out of control lately, I knew something was up! I knew you were hiding something and you were! [Shows her the poster again, but Toph grabs it, tosses it and starts to walk past Katara.] Don't you walk away from me while I'm talking to you! \n",
      "TOPH: [Sarcastically.] Oh really, Mom? Or what are you gonna do? Send me to my room? \n",
      "KATARA: I wish I could! \n",
      "TOPH: Well you can't! Because you're not my mom, and you're not their mom! [Extends her arm at Aang and Sokka, who are sitting on a ledge.] \n",
      "KATARA: I never said I was! \n",
      "TOPH: No, but you certainly act like it! You think it's your job to boss everyone around, but it's not! You're just a regular kid like the rest of us! So stop acting like you can tell me what to do! I can do whatever I want! \n",
      "KATARA: I don't act that way! [Looks at Sokka, who jumps as she says his name.] Sokka, do I act motherly? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Puts his hands up defensively.] Hey. I'm staying out of this one. \n",
      "KATARA: [Looks at Aang.] What do you think, Aang? Do I act like a mom? \n",
      "AANG: [Rubs his eye.] Well. I, uh- \n",
      "KATARA: [Slightly annoyed.] Stop rubbing your eye and speak clearly when you talk! \n",
      "AANG: [He and Sokka sit straight.] Yes, ma'am. \n",
      "TOPH: I can't be around you right now! \n",
      "KATARA: Well, I can't be around you! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Both girls turn and walk away. Hawky, sitting on Sokka's shoulder, screeches. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Rests his head in his hands.] I know, Hawky. Why can't they just get along? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Later on at camp, Sokka and Aang are sitting together. Toph and Katara are sitting at separate edges of the cliff, their backs to one another. \n",
      "SOKKA: Hey, Aang. You wanna test out my messenger hawk with me? I've got an idea. \n",
      "AANG: Sure. [Leans his head closer to Sokka.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Talks into Aang's ear.] I'm going to send a note to Katara and say it's from Toph, who wants to apologize. Then everyone will be friends again. \n",
      "AANG: I gotta say, Sokka, you continue to impress me with your ideas. \n",
      "SOKKA: It's a gift. [Pulls out a pen and ink and a piece of paper and starts to write.] \"Dear Katara, sorry for everything. Your friend, Toph.\" \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka positions Hawky on his arm and places the note in Hawky's message holder. Hawky flies to Katara, who takes the note out, reads it, and angrily stands up. \n",
      "KATARA: I know this is from you, Sokka! Toph can't write! [Tears the note up into pieces.] Ugh! You're all driving me crazy! [Turns and walks away.] \n",
      "AANG: I can't believe we forgot Toph can't write. \n",
      "SOKKA: Yup. We're idiots. [Hawky flies back onto his arm.] \n",
      "AANG: I guess Plan B is we send a note to Toph pretending it's from Katara. \n",
      "SOKKA: I think we're gonna run into a similar problem. [Hawky screeches.] Sorry, Hawky. Looks like I'm gonna have to do this without your help. [Walks to Toph.] Come on. We need to talk. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph exhales, annoyed. The camera cuts to another area of the camp. Katara is bathing in a lake directly below a cliff. Sokka and Toph walk up to the edge of the cliff and sit down, not noticing Katara. \n",
      "TOPH: So lemme guess: You brought me out here to tell me that your sister's not as annoying as I make her out to be. \n",
      "SOKKA: Nah, she's pretty much a pain. [Katara, looking up at their feet from below and behind, glares and looks away.] She's always got to be right about everything and she gets all bossy and involved and in your business ... \n",
      "TOPH: Yeah. I don't know how you could deal with it. \n",
      "SOKKA: Actually, in a way, I rely on it. [Katara looks back up at them.] \n",
      "TOPH: I don't understand. \n",
      "SOKKA: When our mom died, that was the hardest time in my life. Our family was a mess, but Katara? She had so much strength. She stepped up and took on so much responsibility. She helped fill the void that was left by our mom. \n",
      "TOPH: I guess I never thought about that. \n",
      "SOKKA: I'm gonna tell you something crazy. I never told anyone this before, but honestly? I'm not sure I can remember what my mother looked like. It really seems like my whole life, Katara's been the one looking out for me. She's always been the one that's there. And now, when I try to remember my mom, Katara's is the only face I can picture. [Katara, touched by what Sokka says, is reduced to tears.] \n",
      "TOPH: The truth is sometimes Katara does act motherly, but that's not always a bad thing. She's compassionate and kind, and she actually cares about me. [Wipes away tears from her left eye.] You know, the real me. That's more than my own mom. [Katara, deeply touched by Toph's words, sinks slightly into the water. Toph punches Sokka in the arm.] Don't ever tell her I said any of this! \n",
      "SOKKA: Hey, my lips are sealed. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: At around nightfall, Katara is sitting next to Momo, who is napping with Katara rubbing the top of his head. Katara is looking down in front of her, saddened. She sees Sokka and Toph walking toward her and walks up to Toph. When they reach each other, Sokka keeps walking. \n",
      "KATARA: Hi, Toph. Um, I wanna- \n",
      "TOPH: [Holds up her hand in a \"stop\" fashion.] Katara, stop. You don't need to apologize. I was the one being stupid. These scams are out of control, and I'm done with them. \n",
      "KATARA: [Smiles.] Actually I wasn't going to apologize. I was gonna say ... I wanna pull a scam with you. [Aang and Sokka stare at her from behind, extremely shocked.] \n",
      "TOPH: [Also shocked.] What? You wanna pull a scam? \n",
      "KATARA: Not just any scam. The ultimate scam. [Sokka and Aang, still staring at her with shock, look at each other and faint, foaming from the mouth slightly. Katara puts her arm around Toph's shoulder, who gives a sly smile.] Whaddaya say, Toph? Just me and you. One last go. You in? \n",
      "TOPH: [Excited.] You know I'm in! Now what's this idea of yours? [They walk away and leave Aang and Sokka behind, who are now unconscious and foaming at the mouth.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to Katara and Toph going over the plan. Katara is looking at Toph's wanted poster. \n",
      "KATARA: The plan is simple: This wanted poster says you're worth a lot of money; Ten times more than you've made in all of your scams. So I'm gonna turn you in and collect the reward. Then you metalbend yourself out of jail, and we're on our way. [As she speaks, the screen fades to the beginning of the episode, where Toph is seen running from the authorities and is caught in a net.] \n",
      "TOPH: [Angrily.] How could you do this to me? You betrayed me! \n",
      "KATARA: [Crosses her arms.] You brought this on yourself. I had no choice. [Turns away from Toph.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph is dragged away in the net, all the while glaring back at Katara. Katara glances back slightly and gives a sly smile. She is joined by the chief of authorities. \n",
      "TOWN.AUTHORITY: You did the right thing by turning in the Runaway. \n",
      "KATARA: The right thing is its own reward. \n",
      "TOWN.AUTHORITY: Well, I'm happy to hear you say that. \n",
      "KATARA: [Pauses for a moment.] But, I still want the actual reward. \n",
      "TOWN.AUTHORITY: Of course. Right this way. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Meanwhile, a female guard drags Toph into a jail. She throws Toph from the net into a wooden cell and closes it. Toph feels the floor of her cell, but is shocked when she can't sense any earth in it. She gets up and looks outside the cell at the guard. \n",
      "TOPH: Hey! What kind of cell is this? \n",
      "FEMALE.GUARD: A wooden one. [She walks away as Toph becomes visibly worried.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: In an office, the town authority grabs a box underneath a desk and looks around in it. A door opens behind Katara, who is standing across the desk from the chief. The chief closes the box and points at Katara. \n",
      "TOWN.AUTHORITY: That's her! That's the girl you were looking for! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara turns and sees the assassin with the third eye tattooed on his head, aka \"Sparky-Sparky-Boom Man\", walk in, leaving her shocked and horrified. Meanwhile, at camp, Sokka and Aang are worried, the latter pacing back and forth. \n",
      "AANG: Do you think this scam of theirs should be taking this long? \n",
      "SOKKA: I was just wondering the same thing. We'd better check it out. [To Hawky and Momo.] You two behave. [Pointing at Appa.] Appa's in charge. [Appa lifts his head as the two animals start screeching at each other as soon as Sokka and Aang leave, but stop as soon as Appa roars at them.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera cuts to Toph's cell, which now holds Katara too. They both are sitting on the floor, downcast, when Toph suddenly realizes something. \n",
      "TOPH: Wait! It's a trap! \n",
      "KATARA: [Sarcastically.] Really? No kidding! Is that why we're sitting in a wooden cage right now? Gee, how'd you figure out it was a trap? \n",
      "TOPH: Not for us, Katara! We're the bait! He wants Aang! [Katara's eyes widen with realization.] \n",
      "KATARA: I can't believe I'm so stupid! See? This is exactly why I'm against these scams! I knew this would happen! \n",
      "TOPH: But, this was your idea. \n",
      "KATARA: I know. I wanted to show that I'm not so motherly. I wanted to show you that I can have fun too. \n",
      "TOPH: Katara, you are fun. If nothing else, you're at least fun to argue with. \n",
      "KATARA: I know your relationship with your parents is complicated. And I shouldn't have said what I said. \n",
      "TOPH: It's okay. I was really mad when you said that because ... well because, maybe it's true. [Starts to cry.] I try not to think about it, but when I left, I probably really hurt them. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara embraces Toph. Meanwhile, Sokka and Aang walk around town looking for Katara and Toph. The town is seemingly abandoned. \n",
      "SOKKA: Where do you think they might be? \n",
      "AANG: Where do you think anyone is? [The assassin is seen walking across a rooftop behind them. Aang hears him inhaling and becomes shocked when he turns and sees him.] Sokka, watch out! [He grabs Sokka as they dodge a blast from the assassin and take cover behind an Ozai statue.] It's Sparky-Sparky-Boom Man! \n",
      "SOKKA: You know, I'm starting to think that name doesn't quite fit. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The assassin jumps down from the roof and fires another blast at them. They barely dodge it, but get sent flying back by the blast, which shakes the ceiling of Toph and Katara's cell. Toph is trying to break out, while Katara is sitting down. \n",
      "KATARA: What are we gonna do? \n",
      "TOPH: I don't know. I wish we had some earth or water. We need bendables. \n",
      "KATARA: What about your meteor bracelet? You can make a saw. \n",
      "TOPH: I left it back at camp. [Sits down.] I was worried they would take it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara exhales deeply and wipes her forehead with the back of her hand. Her eyes widen with realization as she notices her hand is covered in sweat. She smiles and quickly stands up to start running in place. \n",
      "TOPH: [Confused.] Um, Katara? Are you okay? \n",
      "KATARA: Just fine. \n",
      "TOPH: [Still confused.] Well, what are you doing? \n",
      "KATARA: I'm making my own water. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara stops running and wipes her forehead again. This time, she uses waterbending to use the midair sweat as blades to cut through the wooden cage. Toph stands up upon noticing this. \n",
      "TOPH: [Amazed.] Katara! You're a genius! A sweaty, stinky genius! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara waterbends another blade of sweat, this time from under her arms. Cut to Aang and Sokka being chased by the assassin. The assassin fires a blast at them which they dodge but still get sent flying. Sokka crashes onto a wheelbarrow, which they hide behind. \n",
      "SOKKA: This guy is too good! He shoots fire from his brain! \n",
      "AANG: We should split up. He can't chase us both. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The assassin walks out of the smoke. Aang runs off from his left and Sokka from his right. The assassin fires a blast at the wheelbarrow and blows it up. Aang runs past him on a roof to his left. The assassin quickly turns and fires another blast, which sends Aang flying into the Ozai statue. He falls from the statue to the ground. He looks up and sees the assassin standing above him inhale, about to fire another blast at Aang, but his head is suddenly encased in ice. The assassin moves and Aang sees Katara, Sokka, and Toph standing behind the assassin. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, get up! [She helps him up and they run away.] \n",
      "TOPH: Let's get out of here! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The assassin breaks the ice with brute force. He launches another blast at Team Avatar, but Toph quickly launches a boulder at the blast, blowing the boulder up. A pebble from the boulder flies toward the assassin and hits him square in his third eye, which momentarily stuns and angers him. He tries to fire another blast, but with his chi is blocked, he ignites the air around him and gets sent back, head-first into a wall. When he stands up and shakes it off, Team Avatar is gone. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Still running.] Hey, I got it! The perfect name for that guy: \"Combustion Man!\" \n",
      "TOPH: Good job, Sokka. Now let's get outta here before Combustion Man catches us. \n",
      "SOKKA: See? It fits so well! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Later that night, the gang flies to another camp spot on Appa. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Yawns.] Well, I'm exhausted. Hawky, how about you, buddy? [Hawky makes a bird call.] Yeah. You're such a lazy little bird. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang and Sokka get off Appa. Katara is about to dismount Appa, but is stopped by Toph. \n",
      "TOPH: Katara? I need your help. \n",
      "KATARA: [Sits back down.] What is it, Toph? \n",
      "TOPH: [Pulls out a sheet of paper.] I need you to write some things down for me. I wanna send a letter to my parents. \n",
      "KATARA: [Smiling.] I'll be happy to help. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They place a letter inside Hawky's holder and send him off as he flies away. \n",
      "SOKKA: Hey, where'd Hawky go? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to credits. \n",
      "AVATAR.ROKU: [Narrating a preview.] Previously on Avatar ... \n",
      "KATARA: You're looking at the only waterbender in the whole South Pole. This ship has haunted my tribe when Gran-Gran was a little girl. It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks. \n",
      "YUE: The legend said the moon was the first waterbender. Our ancestor saw how it pushed and pulled the tides, and learned how to do it themselves. \n",
      "KATARA: I always noticed my waterbending is stronger at night. \n",
      "TOPH: What are you doing? \n",
      "KATARA: I'm making my own water! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens to a waxing gibbous moon glowing in the night sky. The scene cuts to a shot of a field of fire lilies, a mountain in the distance. Cuts to a forested area, where Team Avatar is camping out among the trees. The darkness of the night gives the landscape an ominous feeling. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Telling a ghost story.] Suddenly, they heard something down the hall in the dark. Oooh ... It came into the torchlight ... and they knew the blade of Wing Fung was haunted! [Draws sword, stands up and points it toward the fire; yells dramatically.] Ooh-aaah! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of the entire group sitting around the campfire. Aang is lying down, Katara is hunched over in a sitting position and Toph sits casually, all three looking unamused. \n",
      "AANG: [Unimpressed.] I think I like \"the man with a sword for a hand\" better. \n",
      "TOPH: Water Tribe slumber parties must stink. \n",
      "KATARA: No, wait! I've got one! And this is a true Southern Water Tribe story. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sitting down.] Is this one of those \"a friend of my cousin knew some guy that this happened to\" stories? \n",
      "KATARA: No, it happened to Mom. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Upon hearing this, Sokka stiffens. Cuts to Aang, who sits up to listen intently. \n",
      "KATARA: One winter when Mom was a girl, a snowstorm buried the whole village for weeks. A month later, Mom noticed she hadn't seen her friend Nini since the storm. So Mom and some others went to check on Nini's family. When they got there, no one was home. [Cuts to ground-level shot of the group sitting around the fire, the camera panning slightly to the right.] Just a fire flickering in the fireplace. While the men went out to search, Mom stayed in the house. When she was alone, she heard a voice. [In a scary voice.] \"It's so cold and I can't get warm!\" [Sokka stiffens in fear.] Mom turned and saw Nini standing by the fire. She was blue like she was frozen. Mom ran outside for help, but when everyone came back, Nini was gone. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang uses Momo's ears to cover his face in fear. The camera shifts to show Sokka hiding behind a gnarled tree stump. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Peering from behind a tree trunk.] Where'd she go? \n",
      "KATARA: No one knows. Nini's house stands empty to this day, but sometimes, people see smoke coming up from the chimney, like little Nini is still trying to get warm. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera zooms out to where the gang is all huddled by the fire. Suddenly, Toph straightens up and places her hands on the ground. \n",
      "TOPH: [Gasping.] Wait! Guys, did you hear that? [Aang, Katara, and Sokka clutch each other tightly, too stiff to move, with Toph standing alertly.] I hear people under the mountain. And they're screaming. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka, assuming Toph is joking, relaxes his grip. \n",
      "SOKKA: Pft! Nice try, Toph. \n",
      "TOPH: [Cuts to shot of the campsite viewed through the ominous looking tree branches.] No, I'm serious. I hear something. \n",
      "KATARA: You're probably just jumpy from the ghost stories ... \n",
      "TOPH: It just ... stopped. \n",
      "AANG: [Cuts back to him and Katara, still hugging, Sokka sitting close by.] All right, now I'm getting scared. \n",
      "HAMA: [Off-camera from behind group.] Hello, children. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Everyone screams in terror upon hearing the strange woman's voice and scrambles from the ground. An elderly woman emerges from the shadows. \n",
      "HAMA: Sorry to frighten you. My name is Hama. [Cuts to side-view of the campsite.] You children shouldn't be out in the forest by yourselves at night. [Cuts to ground-level shot of Hama standing over the fire.] I have an inn nearby. Why don't you come back there for some spiced tea and warm beds? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sheepishly, places arm behind head.] Yes, please. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Hama smiles and begins walking away. The scene changes to a village, her local inn lying atop a small hill. Cuts to inside the building, where tea is being poured into a teacup. Cuts to shot of the group sitting around the kitchen table. \n",
      "KATARA: Thanks for letting us stay here tonight. You have a lovely inn. \n",
      "HAMA: [Sets teapot down.] Aren't you sweet? [Walks over to her seat and sits down.] You know you should be careful. People have been disappearing in those woods you were camping in. \n",
      "SOKKA: What do you mean \"disappearing\"? \n",
      "HAMA: [Sets her teacup down.] When the moon turns full, people walk in and they don't come out. [Stand up and holds up her teapot; cheerfully smiling.] Who wants more tea? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of the group, who has by now fallen completely silent, the camera panning to the right to show all of them sitting around the table. \n",
      "HAMA: Don't worry, you'll all be completely safe here. [Clasps hands together and smiles.] Why don't I show you to your rooms and you can get a good night's rest? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to Sokka's room, where he is lying in bed with Momo asleep on the floor. Cuts to shot of him in bed as he rolls over. A creaking noise comes from outside, frightening him. He draws his sword quickly while Momo scampers under the covers. \n",
      "SOKKA: I know, Momo. [Places sword back inside holster and sets it down.] This place is creepy! [Lies back down on the pillow and pulls the covers over him.] I don't know if I'm gonna be able to fall asleep! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene switches over to later in the night, where Sokka is fast asleep in his bed, snoring and drooling on his pillow. As it fades to the morning, he is lying sideways, next to the bed, though still fast asleep. Cut to a close-up of his face as a shadow approaches him. He slowly awakens, rubbing his eye. \n",
      "HAMA: [Off-camera.] Wakey, wakey! [Cuts to shot of the innkeeper, standing brightly over him.] Time to go shopping! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara appears by her side, dressed and happily smiling. The camera shifts counter-clockwise, showing Sokka later in the day, dressed in his ordinary clothes, standing in the marketplace where Hama has just made her purchase. A friendly old man smiles and waves to her as she walks away. \n",
      "KATARA: That Mr. Yao seems to have a thing for you. Maybe we should go back and see if he'll give us some free komodo sausages? \n",
      "HAMA: [Seriously.] You would have me use my feminine charms to take advantage of that poor man? [Cheerfully.] I think you and I are going to get along swimmingly! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two walk off camera with Katara smiling at this remark. The scene switches over to two villagers having a conversation by a stand. \n",
      "VILLAGER: You won't have any ash bananas till next week? \n",
      "SHOP.OWNER: Well, I have to send the boy to Hing Wa Island to get them, and it's a two-day trip. \n",
      "VILLAGER: Oh, right. Tomorrow's the full moon. \n",
      "SHOP.OWNER: [In a lowered voice.] Exactly. I can't lose another delivery boy in the woods. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of Aang, Sokka, and Toph walking through the marketplace. Aang carrying a package slung over his shoulder, Sokka carrying a package attached to his sword, while Toph carries a large, round basket on her head. \n",
      "SOKKA: People disappearing in the woods, weird stuff happening during full moons? This just reeks of Spirit World shenanigans. \n",
      "AANG: I bet if we take a little walk around town, we'll find out what these people did to the environment to make the spirits mad. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Makes gesture with his hand.] And then you can sew up this little mystery lickety-split, Avatar style! \n",
      "AANG: [Proudly.] Helping people ... that's what I do. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to overhead shot of the group standing in the marketplace as he, Sokka and Toph approach Katara and Hama. \n",
      "HAMA: Why don't you take all those things back to the inn? I just have to run a couple more errands. I'll be back in a little while. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Walks up to her.] This is a mysterious little town you have here. \n",
      "HAMA: [Extremely close-up. Ominously.] Mysterious town for mysterious children. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She smiles creepily and saunters away, leaving Sokka feeling suspicious. The scene changes to a shot of Hama's inn, starting outside, before moving inside, where the gang is unpacking groceries. Sokka walks over to a counter and sets his basket down. \n",
      "SOKKA: That Hama seems a little strange. Like she knows something, or she's hiding something. \n",
      "KATARA: [Unpacking items.] That's ridiculous. She's a nice woman who took us in and gave us a place to stay. [Picks up cabbage.] She kinda reminds me of Gran-Gran. \n",
      "SOKKA: But what did she mean by that comment, \"mysterious children\"? \n",
      "KATARA: Gee, I don't know. Maybe because she found four strange kids camping in the woods at night? Isn't that a little mysterious? \n",
      "SOKKA: I'm gonna take a look around. [Walks away and up a flight of wooden stairs.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Appears along with the others at the bottom of the stairwell.] Sokka! Sokka, what are you doing? [Off-camera as Sokka peers around the inn.] You can't just snoop around someone's house. \n",
      "SOKKA: It'll be fine. \n",
      "AANG: [Off-camera while Sokka peers into a room.] She could be home any minute. \n",
      "KATARA: [Walking down hallway with the rest of the team.] Sokka, you're gonna get us all in trouble and this is just plain rude! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Tugging on a cupboard door.] I'm not finished yet. [Grunts, as he tries to pull it free.] Come on ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The cupboard suddenly opens, revealing several wooden puppets stowed inside. The dolls fall forward, held together only by their strings. Everyone gasps; Sokka withdraws his sword, backs up and points it straight at the puppets. \n",
      "AANG: Okay, that's pretty creepy. \n",
      "KATARA: [Walks over and closes the cupboard; a bit weirded out.] So she's got a hobby. There's nothing weird about that. [Angrily.] Sokka, you've looked enough. [Off-camera as Sokka ascends into the attic.] Hama will be back soon. \n",
      "SOKKA: Just an ordinary puppet-loving innkeeper, huh? Well then why does she have a locked door up here? \n",
      "KATARA: [Annoyed.] Probably to keep people like you from snooping through her stuff! \n",
      "SOKKA: We'll see. [Peers through the keyhole into the room. Cuts to shot of the attic from his perspective. Through the keyhole, a small room can be seen, with a chest lying on the ground in the middle. The camera zooms in on the chest.] It's empty, except for a little chest. \n",
      "TOPH: Maybe it's treasure! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka grows excited, his eyes growing wide, and uses his sword to pick the lock. \n",
      "KATARA: [Approaches him.] Sokka, what are you doing? You're breaking into a private room! \n",
      "SOKKA: I have to see what's in there. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The door unlocks and creaks open. The four step cautiously inside; Sokka puts away his sword and approaches the small chest. \n",
      "AANG: We shouldn't be doing this. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka picks up the chest and tries to pry it open, only to discover it is locked. \n",
      "SOKKA: Maybe there's a key here somewhere ... \n",
      "TOPH: Ooh! Hand it over! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She takes the chest, removes her meteor bracelet from her arm and earthbends it into the shape of a small key, which she sticks into the keyhole of the chest. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Eagerly.] Come on, come on! \n",
      "TOPH: [Annoyed; Katara appears from behind her, peering nervously over her shoulder.] This isn't as easy as it looks! \n",
      "AANG: [Nervously.] Guys, I don't know about this ... \n",
      "KATARA: This is crazy! I'm leaving! \n",
      "SOKKA: Suit yourself! Do it, Toph! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara turns to leave the moment Toph signals that she has successfully opened the chest, holding her thumb up. All four eagerly surround the box in a comical fashion, anticipating what they will find inside. \n",
      "HAMA: [Off-camera from behind them.] I'll tell you what's in the box. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: All, except Toph, scream and turn sharply to find Hama standing in the doorway. Cuts to shot of the group, still looking stunned, except Toph. Sokka guiltily hands her the box. Cuts to shot from inside the chest, as Hama lifts the lid and reaches her hand inside. Cuts to close-up of Sokka, his eyes wide in anxiousness, and a shot of Hama still in the process of lifting the object. Cuts to shot of the team standing together from her perspective. Her left arm appears on-screen, a blue whale tooth comb in her hand. Cuts to shot of her holding the comb, smiling. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Surprised.] An old comb? \n",
      "HAMA: It's my greatest treasure. It's the last thing I own from growing up in the Southern Water Tribe. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera zooms in on Katara and Sokka, who stare at her in astonishment. \n",
      "KATARA: [Stunned.] You're from the Southern Water Tribe? \n",
      "HAMA: [Sets down comb.] Just like you. \n",
      "KATARA: How did you know? \n",
      "HAMA: I heard you talking around your campfire. \n",
      "SOKKA: But why didn't you tell us? \n",
      "HAMA: I wanted to surprise you! I bought all this food today so I could fix you a big Water Tribe dinner. Of course, I can't get all the ingredients I need here, but ocean kumquats are a lot like sea prunes if you stew them long enough. \n",
      "AANG: [Sticking his tongue out in disgust.] Great ... \n",
      "KATARA: I knew I felt a bond with you right away. \n",
      "SOKKA: And I knew you were keeping a secret, so I guess we're both right. [Grimaces as Katara hits him in the arm.] But I'm sorry we were sneaking around. \n",
      "HAMA: Apology accepted. [Turns to the side and motions with her hand.] Now, let's get cooking! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to later that night, where Aang races from the inn to the barn located toward the back of the property. Cuts to overhead shot of inside the barn, where Appa and Momo lie. The doors creak open and Aang steps inside. Cuts to ground-level shot of him standing before the bison, tossing a cabbage-like vegetable into Appa's mouth. Momo dances in front of the bison's face and chitters, irritated. Appa opens his mouth and releases the cabbage, which Momo grabs. The lemur skitters away. Cuts to shot of Hama's kitchen table, as she sets down a bowl of soup. Cuts to shot of the entire room, the team and the innkeeper sitting around the table. Sokka is seen chewing on a food item, as Hama takes her seat at the head of the table. \n",
      "AANG: [Whispering to Toph.] I'd steer clear of the sea prunes. \n",
      "TOPH: I thought they were ocean kumquats. \n",
      "AANG: Close enough. \n",
      "HAMA: Who wants five flavor soup? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: All four raise their hands in acceptance. Hama situates her hands over the bowl and suddenly uses waterbending to summon a globule of soup and fill each of their bowls. Cuts to shot of the team looking at the spectacle in astonishment, the camera panning to the right. Four streams of soup land gracefully into each of their bowls. \n",
      "KATARA: [Delighted.] You're a waterbender! [Faces Hama in delight.] I've never met another waterbender from our tribe! \n",
      "HAMA: [Cuts to side-view of her; sadly.] That's because the Fire Nation wiped them all out. I was the last one ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of Sokka and Katara, Katara clasping her hands together, an expression of pity on her face. \n",
      "SOKKA: So how did you end up out here? \n",
      "HAMA: [Grimly.] I was stolen from my home. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene fades to a flashback of a much younger Hama peacefully sauntering through her Southern Water Tribe village. \n",
      "HAMA: [Voice-over.] It was over sixty years ago when the raids started. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She approaches her friend, Kanna, and they share a laugh before they notice ashen snow falling from the sky. The two race to the shores, where five Fire Nation ships are rapidly approaching the tribe. Five fireballs are launched from trebuchets and strike the village. Fire Nation soldiers swarm the area, battling the waterbenders, who desperately attempt to fend them off. \n",
      "HAMA: [Voice-over.] They came again and again, each time rounding up more of our waterbenders and taking them captive. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The battle scene fades to another scene, where Hama and several other waterbenders use waterbending to capsize a Fire Nation vessel. \n",
      "HAMA: [Voice-over.] We did our best to hold them off, but our numbers dwindled as the raids continued. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As she is narrating, Water Tribe civilians who aided in the suspension of the vessel are seen slowly fading, signaling their capture by the Fire Nation. The camera rotates around her and zooms out, revealing dozens of firebenders surrounding her. \n",
      "HAMA: [Voice-over.] Finally, I too was captured. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The younger Hama is seen being led by Fire Nation soldiers onto one of their naval vessels, having now been captured herself. \n",
      "HAMA: [Voice-over.] I was led away in chains. The last waterbender of the Southern Water Tribe. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A final scene shows her looking out onto her tribe's members, including her friend, Kanna, in tears as the bow creaks upward. The flashback ends. Now in present time, Katara is seen walking over to Hama and placing her arms around her shoulder comfortingly. \n",
      "HAMA: They put us in terrible prisons here in the Fire Nation. I was the only one who managed to escape. \n",
      "SOKKA: How did you get away? And why did you stay in the Fire Nation? \n",
      "HAMA: I'm sorry. It's too painful to talk about anymore. \n",
      "KATARA: We completely understand. We lost our mother in a raid. \n",
      "HAMA: [Sympathetically.] Oh, you poor things. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang and Sokka cast their heads down solemnly. \n",
      "KATARA: I can't tell you what it means to meet you. It's an honor. You're a hero. \n",
      "HAMA: I never thought I'd meet another Southern waterbender. I'd like to teach you what I know so you can carry on the Southern tradition when I'm gone. \n",
      "KATARA: Yes! Yes, of course! To learn about my heritage, it would mean everything to me. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She bows to her newfound friend, who smiles warmly. The scene changes to the next day, where Hama and Katara are strolling on the outskirts of Hama's village. \n",
      "HAMA: Growing up in the South Pole, waterbenders are totally at home surrounded by snow and ice and seas. But as you probably noticed on your travels, that isn't the case wherever you go. \n",
      "KATARA: I know! When we were stranded in the desert, I felt like there was almost nothing I could do. \n",
      "HAMA: [Stops walking.] That's why you have to learn to control water wherever it exists. \n",
      "KATARA: I've even used my own sweat for waterbending. \n",
      "HAMA: [Smiling.] That's very resourceful, Katara. You're thinking like a true master. But did you know you could even pull water out of thin air? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: In a quick movement of her right arm, Hama uses waterbending to manipulate the water vapor in the air, liquefying it and coating her fingertips. \n",
      "HAMA: You have got to keep an open mind, Katara. [The water around her fingertips freezes, creating ice claws.] There's water in places you never think about. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She proceeds to fire the small daggers at a nearby tree, while Katara looks on in amazement.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Aang, Sokka, and Toph are wandering about the landscape surrounding the village, trying to uncover any signs of disruption that would anger the spirits. \n",
      "AANG: This has got to be the nicest natural setting in the Fire Nation. I don't see anything that would make a spirit mad around here. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera focuses on Toph and Sokka. Toph is standing casually near where Sokka is deeply inhaling the aroma of a bundle of flowers. \n",
      "TOPH: Maybe the Moon Spirit just turned mean. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Angrily.] The Moon Spirit is a gentle, loving lady. She rules the sky with compassion and ... lunar goodness! \n",
      "AANG: [Catches sight of a villager walking past.] Excuse me, sir. Can you tell us anything about the spirit that's been stealing people? \n",
      "VILLAGER: Only one man ever saw it and lived and that's Old Man Ding. \n",
      "TOPH: Where does Old Man Ding live? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to a field of fire lilies, where Hama continues to tutor Katara in waterbending. \n",
      "KATARA: Wow, these flowers are beautiful. \n",
      "HAMA: They're called fire lilies. They only bloom a few weeks a year, but they're one of my favorite things about living here. And like all plants and all living things, they're filled with water. \n",
      "KATARA: I met a waterbender who lived in a swamp and could control the vines by bending the water inside. \n",
      "HAMA: You can take it even further. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: In a sharp, swiveling motion, she draws water from dozens of the surrounding fire lilies and slices a nearby rock clean through. \n",
      "KATARA: That was incredible! [Sees the wilted lilies.] It's a shame about the lilies, though. \n",
      "HAMA: They're just flowers. When you're a waterbender in a strange land, you do what you must to survive. Tonight I'll teach you the ultimate technique of waterbending. It can only be done during the full moon, when your bending is at its peak. \n",
      "KATARA: [Cautiously.] But isn't that dangerous? I thought people have been disappearing around here during the full moon. \n",
      "HAMA: Oh, Katara. Two master waterbenders beneath a full moon? [Begins walking away.] I don't think we have anything to worry about. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two exit the field. The scene fades to later that night, where Aang, Sokka, and Toph are approaching Old Man Ding, who is boarding up his windows. \n",
      "AANG: Old Man Ding? \n",
      "DING: Huh? [Accidentally hammers his thumb.] Ow, dang blame it! What? Can't you see I'm busy? Got a full moon rising. And why does everyone call me that? I'm not that old! [Attempts to lift a wooden plank off the ground, but fails to do so. Sighs.] Well, I'm young at heart. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang approaches and helps Ding lift the board. \n",
      "DING: Not ready to get snapped up by some moon monster yet at least. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Proceeds to nail the board to the window frame.] We wanted to ask you about that. \n",
      "AANG: Did you get a good look at the spirit that took you? \n",
      "DING: Didn't see no spirit, just felt something come over me, like I was possessed. Forced me to start walking toward the mountain. [Points to the mountain.] I tried to fight it, but I couldn't control my own limbs. It just about had me into a cave up there. [Imitates a walking puppet.] And I looked up at the moon for what I thought would be my last glimpse of light. [Cuts to shot of the trio, Sokka quivering in fear.] But then the sun started to rise and I got control of myself again! I just high-tailed it away from that mountain as quick as I could! \n",
      "SOKKA: Why would a spirit want to take people to a mountain? \n",
      "TOPH: Oh no! [Sokka and Aang assume defensive positions.] I did hear people screaming under the mountain. The missing villagers must still be there! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They all stare at the mountain. The scene changes to where Aang, Sokka, and Toph are racing through the dark forest in search of the imprisoned villagers. \n",
      "TOPH: [Feels the ground with her hand.] I can hear them. They're this way! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The trio proceeds to sprint toward the mountain. Meanwhile, Hama and Katara venture into the moonlit forest. \n",
      "HAMA: Can you feel the power the full moon brings? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She inhales deeply through her nose and stretches her arms outward, flexing her limbs which causes her veins to bulge out, while Katara looks on in disgust. \n",
      "HAMA: For generations it has blessed waterbenders with its glow, allowing us to do incredible things! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera depicts a shot of her standing beneath the full moon. \n",
      "HAMA: [Extreme close-up; in a sinister tone.] I've never felt more alive. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to Aang, Sokka, and Toph, who have arrived at the mountain and are standing before the mouth of the cave. \n",
      "TOPH: This is the place. \n",
      "SOKKA: I can't see anything down there. \n",
      "TOPH: [Grabs Sokka's hand.] That's why you have me. Let's go! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The three descend into the dark cave and approach a solid metal door, torches nearby. Using metalbending, Toph breaks it down, while the trio proceeds to make their way through the tunnel, Aang and Sokka lighting their path with the torches. They arrive to see several villagers chained to the walls of the cave. \n",
      "MALE.PRISONER.#1: We're saved! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph unfastens her meteor bracelet and begins to unlock the prisoners' shackles. \n",
      "AANG: I didn't know spirits made prisons like this. Who brought you here? \n",
      "FEMALE.PRISONER: It was no spirit. \n",
      "MALE.PRISONER.#2: It was a witch! \n",
      "SOKKA: A witch? What do you mean? \n",
      "FEMALE.PRISONER: [Speaking, as Toph unlocks her shackles.] She seems like a normal old woman, but she controls people like some dark puppetmaster! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Gritting.] Hama! \n",
      "MALE.PRISONER.#1: Yes, the innkeeper! \n",
      "SOKKA: I knew there was something creepy about her! \n",
      "AANG: We have to stop Hama! \n",
      "TOPH: I'll get these people out of here. You go! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang and Sokka flee from the scene, while Toph stays behind. The scene switches to the forest. A cat owl hoots and flies away. The camera focuses on Hama and Katara, their backs facing the camera, the wind blowing their hair slightly, looking toward the moon. \n",
      "HAMA: What I'm about to show you, [Cuts to close-up of Hama glaring menacingly.] I discovered in that wretched Fire Nation prison. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene fades to a flashback of a younger Hama imprisoned within a cage. She peers through the bars of her cell and looks down mournfully. The camera zooms out to the entire prison room. \n",
      "HAMA: [Voice-over.] The guards were always very careful to keep any water away from us. They piped in dry air and had us suspended away from the ground. Before giving us any water, they would bind our hands and feet so we couldn't bend. [A side-view is shown of Fire Nation guards giving water to a tied up prisoner.] Any sign of trouble was met with cruel retribution. [Cuts to shot of the full moon in the sky during present day.] And yet each month, I felt the full moon enriching me with its energy. [Cuts to shot of Hama.] There had to be something I could do to escape. [Scene fades to flashback of the prison.] Then I realized that where there is life, there is water. [A younger Hama is shown bending the water inside an elephant rat that had wandered its way into her cage.] The rats that scurried across the floor of my cage were nothing more than skins filled with liquid and I passed years developing the skill that would lead to my escape. [A close-up is shown of Hama smiling at her discovery. The scene fades back to present day. Ominously.] Bloodbending. [Cut to a scared Katara.] Controlling the water in another body, [Cut to ground shot of both Hama and Katara.] enforcing your own will over theirs. [The scene fades back to a flashback of young Hama controlling a horde of rats using bloodbending.] Once I had mastered the rats, I was ready for the men. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera switches over to show a Fire Nation guard strolling past the cages when a sudden feeling comes over him. Using bloodbending, Hama forces the guard to grab hold of his keys and unlock her cell, thus marking her escape. \n",
      "HAMA: [Voice-over.] And during the next full moon, I walked free for the first time in decades. [The guard attempts to get up, but Hama quickly forces him back down to the ground. She walks unsteadily away.] My cell unlocked by the very guards assigned to keep me in. [Scene changes back to present day; camera focuses on a close-up of Hama.] Once you perfect this technique, you can control anything or [Looks at Katara from the corner of her eyes sadistically.] anyone. \n",
      "KATARA: [Unsure.] But ... to reach inside someone and control them? [Casts unsure glance off to the side.] I don't know if I want that kind of power. \n",
      "HAMA: [Camera zooms out to the two standing in the forest.] The choice is not yours. The power exists. And it's your duty to use the gifts you've been given to win this war. [Closes up to Hama.] Katara, they tried to wipe us out, our entire culture, your mother! \n",
      "KATARA: [Close-up of her face.] I know. \n",
      "HAMA: [Camera changes back to Hama.] Then you should understand what I'm talking about! We're the last two waterbenders of the Southern Tribe. [Camera focuses on Katara; off-camera.] We have to fight these people whenever we can, wherever they are, with any means necessary! \n",
      "KATARA: [Widens eyes in realization.] It's you ... [Angrily.] You're the one who's been making people disappear during the full moons! \n",
      "HAMA: [Close-up of her face, as she tilts her head downward.] They threw me in prison to rot, along with my brothers and sisters! They deserve the same! You must carry on my work! \n",
      "KATARA: [Points to Hama, stretching out her left hand.] I won't! I won't use bloodbending and I won't allow you to keep terrorizing this town! [Her hand suddenly twists to one side. She tries desperately to stop it, but fails to do so.] \n",
      "HAMA: [Now using bloodbending to subdue to her.] You should've learned the technique before you turned against me! [Forces Katara into a strained position.] It's impossible to fight your way out of my grip! I control every muscle, every vein in your body! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: With swift motions of her hands and arms, Hama uses bloodbending to twist Katara around and throw her from side to side. She positions Katara directly before her and uses a downward motion of her hand to force her into a submissive state. \n",
      "KATARA: [Tearfully.] Stop! Please ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Hama laughs cruelly and keeps Katara subdued. The shot is showing the full moon slowly fades to a close-up of Katara's face as she is crying. Several moments pass as the young waterbender begins to break free from Hama's grip. Hama stares in shock as Katara inhales deeply and rises, now free from her grasp. \n",
      "KATARA: [Determined.] You're not the only one who draws power from the moon! [Assumes a fighting stance.] My bending is more powerful than yours, Hama. Your technique is useless on me! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A waterbending duel ensues between the two. Katara pulls a ring of water around her waist and sends the stream of water at Hama, who halts it and sends it back to Katara. In a swift spinning motion, Katara sends the stream toward Hama again, who draws water from nearby trees, deflects the attack and sends a highly pressurized water jet at her. Katara uses her hands to block the attack, disintegrating the water into droplets. Upon seeing Katara's bending prowess, Hama becomes shocked, allowing for her opponent to use waterbending to knock her to the ground. \n",
      "HAMA: [Shouts.] Aahhh! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka and Aang approach the scene as Hama rises to her knees. \n",
      "SOKKA: We know what you've been doing, Hama! \n",
      "AANG: Give up! [Takes a fighting stance.] You're outnumbered! \n",
      "HAMA: No! [Rising.] You've outnumbered yourselves. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She begins bloodbending Aang and Sokka, who yell in fear, and sends them in Katara's direction. Katara pushes them out of her way and draws water from the ground, sending a stream at Hama, who in turn draws water from a vine and uses a water wheel to deflect the attack. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Unwillingly draws his sword.] Katara, look out! [Forced to walk like a puppet, while waving the blade back and forth rapidly.] It's like my brain has a mind of its own! Stop it arm, stop it! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara pulls up a ring of water and pushes Sokka away. \n",
      "AANG: This feels weird! \n",
      "KATARA: [Using waterbending to freeze him to a nearby tree.] I'm sorry, Aang! \n",
      "AANG: It's okay! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She catches sight of Sokka, still under Hama's power, unwillingly prepared to strike her with his sword. She draws water from a vine and freezes his sword and hand to a tree as well. \n",
      "HAMA: [Sinisterly.] Don't hurt your friends, Katara! And don't let them hurt each other! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She uses bloodbending to break Aang and Sokka free from their ice encasement and send them colliding straight into one another with Sokka's sword pointing straight at Aang. \n",
      "KATARA: [Horrified.] No! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang and Sokka abruptly halt in their tracks and look at their hands in confusion. The camera focuses in on Hama, who has suddenly stiffened, and cuts to Katara, an unsure look on her face as she uses bloodbending to subdue the elder. Focusing first on Hama, who grunts in discomfort, the camera turns to show the imprisoned villagers and Toph approaching the scene before cutting to moments later when the elderly waterbender is arrested, handcuffs placed around her wrists. \n",
      "MALE.PRISONER.#1: You're going to be locked away forever. \n",
      "HAMA: My work is done. [Turns to Katara.] Congratulations, Katara. You're a bloodbender. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera focuses on Katara, who is clearly distressed and breaks down in tears. Hama is shown laughing evilly as she is dragged away by the villagers. The camera returns to focus on Katara, who is crying underneath the full moon as Aang, arm around her, and Sokka, hand on her back, attempt to comfort her. Fades to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Some koala sheep are sleeping, as Katara, Sokka, Aang, Toph, and Appa come out of the bushes. Sokka looks at a map, while everyone else looks around. Momo jumps over on Aang's shoulder, as Aang scratches his head. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Somewhat excitedly.] This is it! The official rendezvous point for the invasion force. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera pans to the left, showing a vast area of the place. \n",
      "TOPH: How did you pick this place? \n",
      "SOKKA: Before we split up, my dad and I found this island on the map. It's uninhabited, and the harbors surrounded by the cliffs seemed like the perfect secluded place. \n",
      "KATARA: Nice choice, Sokka. And we're here four days ahead of schedule. \n",
      "AANG: [Anxiously.] Wait! Four days? The invasion's in four days? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Yawns.] Whatever. That's like four days from now. Let's just calm down and- \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka falls asleep and begins snoring. \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka's got the right idea, Aang. We're here. We're ready. The best thing we can do now is get plenty of rest. [Lies down.] \n",
      "AANG: [Half-heartedly.] I guess. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Everyone else falls asleep. Aang lies down and, as he closes his eyes, the camera zooms in on his face.\n",
      "Scene briefly fades to black before changing to a large Fire Nation insignia, which is revealed to be a door when the camera zooms back. The door busts open, revealing a boy with large hair, a headband, and a yellow jump suit, with his face turned the other side. He enters the room with a series of dramatic gestures. It is revealed that this boy is Aang in strange attire. Aang quickly jumps on to a rock tower. Cut to wider shot of Aang standing on the rock tower, surrounded by floating broken pillars. \n",
      "AANG: [He makes some fast and dramatic ninja-like moves as he speaks.] Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord! I'm bringing you down. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to close-up of the Fire Lord, who is about to take a bite of a bundle of grapes with his eyes closed. Hearing Aang's words, he stops and opens his eyes to look down at his adversary. The camera pans out quickly to reveal he is actually a giant when compared to Aang and surrounded by a pit of fire. \n",
      "OZAI: Really? [Brings his face close to Aang.] How do you plan on doing that when you're not even wearing pants? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Aang's scared face, as he looks down to see that Ozai was telling the truth, and screams. \n",
      "AANG: Oh no! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang quickly covers himself with a white Air Nomad shield pulled out of thin air. The camera zooms out to a larger shot of Aang shaking with embarrassment. Suddenly, giant eyes begin to appear all around him. The eye's close and disappear. Cut to shot of the giant Fire Lord laughing, as Aang slowly backs out the door. The Fire Lord raises his arms to the ceiling, while surrounded by flames, laughing heartily. Aang wakes up and starts touching his pants. Momo is seen awake as well. \n",
      "AANG: It was just a dream, Momo. I still have my pants. [Stands up.] Well, I better keep training. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang walks over to a bush and starts kicking it. Momo gets bored of watching him, and soon falls back asleep. Scene changes to the Fire Nation Palace, where Zuko is getting dressed and ready, with help from his servants. \n",
      "SERVANT.#1: Fresh fruit, Prince Zuko? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko puts out his hand and shakes his head respectfully. \n",
      "SERVANT.#2: May I wash your feet, sir? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko respectfully puts his hand out and shakes his head again. \n",
      "SERVANT.#1: Head massage? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko shakes his head again. \n",
      "SERVANT.#2: Hot towel? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko looks at the towels for a moment and takes one. He is seen wiping his forehead before walking out of the room. The two servants bow behind him. Zuko walks out the palace gates, with Fire Nation citizens waiting for him. One woman becomes overly excited at seeing Zuko, and is taken away by the palace guards. \n",
      "SERVANT.#1: Prince Zuko, is something wrong? You didn't take the palanquin. \n",
      "ZUKO: I'm just going to Mai's house. It's not far. \n",
      "SERVANT.#1: It's not a prince's place to walk anywhere, sir. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko looks to the distance, walks over, and gets into the palanquin. The servants pick it up and walk over to Mai's house. Zuko looks out of the palanquin's curtains and sees Mai, who is standing by the doors to her house, who waves and walks away.\n",
      "The scene changes back to Aang, who is still training. He is now banging his fists against a tree, which wakes up Sokka, Toph, and Katara. Katara looks at Sokka, who just shrugs. She decides to go talk to Aang about this. \n",
      "KATARA: Hey. How long have you been up? \n",
      "AANG: A couple hours. I got a lot more skills to refine if I'm gonna fight Ozai. \n",
      "KATARA: [Aang stops, panting.] You know, there is such a thing as over-training. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang hits the tree one last time, which sends a vibration throughout his body and makes him fall down, with all of the leaves off the tree collapsing on him. Katara just gazes down at him, and Sokka, holding his map, and Toph, who is facing the other direction, look out from behind her. Aang comes out from under the leaves and walks around Katara in a fighting stance. \n",
      "AANG: You don't get it, do you? My form is bad, I'm sloppy, and I still don't know any firebending. Not even the basics. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang's left eye twitches a little bit after saying this. Katara brings Aang's hand down, with a forced smile on her face. Sokka is seen, lying down, still looking at the map. \n",
      "SOKKA: That's okay, Aang. The eclipse will block off firebending anyway. You don't need to know it. [Looking at Aang.] Plus, it's a stupid element. \n",
      "AANG: Okay, well I still have to work on everything else. I better spend the whole day training. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang bows quickly toward Sokka, followed by Katara, and rides off on an air scooter. Sokka moves the map up in front of his face to hide behind it. The view changes to the blue sky, which changes to a starry night. Aang is walking back from his training, now exhausted. Everyone else is asleep. Aang rubs his eyes and yawns before collapsing. \n",
      "AANG: [Wide shot of the group on the cliffside with the camera slowly zooming out.] Good night, Katara. Good night, Sokka. Good night, Toph. Good night, Appa. Good night, Momo. Good night, Appa and Mo- \n",
      "TOPH: [With chibi face in a speech bubble that appears above her; angrily.] Go to sleep already! [Clenches her teeth.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Aang, who flinched upon hearing Toph, but goes back into his normal position and closes his eyes. The camera pans up.\n",
      "The scene fades briefly to black again, before cutting to shot of Aang busting through the same large Fire Nation door from his previous dream. This time, he is wearing boats, white pants, a high collared yellow tunic that covers his mouth, white sleeves with blue arrows on them, and has his chest wrapped in a chain. He has sideburns, his hair is long and stands up straight, wears his headband, and has two small metal rings in the top of his right ear. As he stands in the opening where the doors once were, he snaps his fingers and smoke starts to pour into the entrance. Aang slides in and jumps over some small pillars to face Ozai, who is still a giant. \n",
      "AANG: [Frontal shot as he points outward.] Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord. [Scowls.] I'm bringing you down! [Looks down momentarily; confidently.] And this time, I brought pants. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Camera shows a view of some chains wrapping around Aang's clothing, including his pants. The shot turns to Ozai. \n",
      "OZAI: So it seems, but are you prepared for your ... mathematics test? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A giant abacus lands behind Aang. Camera turns to show Aang's worried face. \n",
      "AANG: Math test? Oh no! I forgot all about the math test! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Ozai is heard laughing in the background as Aang is screaming while being pulled backward and crushed by some beads on the abacus. He suddenly wakes up. \n",
      "AANG: I've gotta be ready. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang gets up and walks away. He is seen pacing around some sleeping koala sheep. Katara comes over to talk to him. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, it's the middle of the night. You need to go back to sleep. \n",
      "AANG: But I forgot my pants and my math test. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara sighs and grabs Aang's shoulder. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, sleep. Please. For me. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang looks at her, rubbing his eyes. He bows his head, and the two walk back. A koala sheep makes a sound. The scene changes to the Royal Palace, where Zuko and Mai are relaxing on a couch. \n",
      "ZUKO: Tell me, if you could have anything you want right now, what would it be? \n",
      "MAI: Hm ... A big fancy fruit tart, with rose petals on top. \n",
      "ZUKO: You know, being a prince and all, I might just be able to make that happen. \n",
      "MAI: [Chuckles.] That would be impressive. \n",
      "ZUKO: [To the servants.] Do you think you could find a fresh fruit tart for the lady, with rose petals on top? \n",
      "SERVANT: Excellent choice, sir. \n",
      "MAI: I guess there's some nice perks that come with being royalty. [Pushing him Zuko to lay down with her.] Though there's annoying stuff, too. Like that all-day war meeting coming up. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Sitting up, followed by Mai.] War meeting? What are you talking about? \n",
      "MAI: Azula mentioned something. I-I assumed you were going, too. \n",
      "ZUKO: I guess I wasn't invited. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two look away from each other. The scene changes back to the Black Cliffs, where Aang is still sleeping. \n",
      "OZAI: Wake up, Aang. Wake up, sleepy head! [Cut to an out of focus swaying shot of the Fire Lord standing over Aang.] Rise and shine! You overslept. [The Fire Lord bends in close and then even closer.] You missed the invasion. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Ozai begins to laugh, and is seen riding a giant, flying hippo cow, which breathes out fire at Aang, making him move from his spot. He watches as Ozai flies away, still laughing. Aang quickly wakes up, and goes to wake up Sokka. \n",
      "AANG: Sokka, get up! I needa know what day it is! \n",
      "SOKKA: What? Who's talking? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka grabs his sword and jumps up, but hits his head on a nearby rock and falls down. Toph and Katara are seen waking up. \n",
      "TOPH: Relax! It's still two days before the invasion! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang begins pulling on Sokka's legs, trying to get him up. \n",
      "AANG: Sokka, you've gotta get up drill your rock-climbing exercises. \n",
      "SOKKA: What? \n",
      "AANG: In one of my dreams, you were running from Fire Nation soldiers, trying to climb this cliff, [Camera turns to show an annoyed look on Sokka's face.] but you were too slow and they got you! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka stands up quickly and steps in front of Aang. \n",
      "SOKKA: But that was just a dream. I'm a great climber! \n",
      "AANG: [While pointing at the cliff nearby.] Then climb that cliff! Climb it fast! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Camera turns to show the size of the cliff. When it sets back on Sokka, he looks at Aang, pointing to the cliff. Aang nods fast, and Sokka reluctantly begins to climb it. \n",
      "SOKKA: Stupid Avatar! Stupid cliff! Stupid dream! I can climb fast! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang is seen looking up at Sokka with an anxious smile, before frowning at seeing how slowly he was going. Toph tries to get a drink of water. \n",
      "AANG: [Turning around to her.] Don't drink that! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka is seen behind Aang falling off the cliff after hearing Aang. Toph spits out the water onto Katara, who waterbends it off her. \n",
      "TOPH: Why? Is it poisoned? \n",
      "AANG: In my dream, we were right in the middle of the invasion, and you had to stop to use the bathroom! [He puts his hands between his legs and squeezes them together.] We died because of your tiny bladder. [He turns to Katara.] And you need to start wearing your hair up. In my dream, your hair got caught in a train, and-. \n",
      "KATARA: [Putting a hand on the side of his face.] Aang! I know you're just trying to help, but you really need to get a grip. You're unraveling. \n",
      "AANG: [He takes a deep breath before finally speaking.] You're right. I'm losing my mind. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka is still climbing the cliff, and almost reaches the top, but is seen sliding down. Cut to the sun in the sky. Cut to Aang's face, his eye twitching, as he paces around, stressed. Cut to his hands rotating between putting his thumb and finger together before alternating to the opposites on the other hand. \n",
      "AANG: It's like every time I think about how stressed I am, I just end up more stressed. I'm like a big growing snowball of nerves. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As he paces, Katara sits, concerned, petting Momo and watching Aang, while Sokka hammers away at a piece of armor for Appa. Toph lies resting against a sleeping Appa. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Turning to look at Aang.] Of course you are. That's 'cause you gotta fight the Fire Lord, the baddest man on the planet. And you better win or we're all done for. \n",
      "KATARA: [Approaching Sokka, annoyed.] Sokka! You're not helping! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Standing.] What? It's true. That's the deal. He knows it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara pushes down Sokka to sit, before looking over at Aang, who is nervously shaking. She walks over to him and touches his shoulders. \n",
      "KATARA: You know what, I've got just the thing! Get ready to be de-stressified! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to Aang and Katara in a mountain doing some yoga. Steaming water in the middle of the room. \n",
      "KATARA: These yoga stretches can really work wonders if you do them in extreme heat. Reach up. [Katara puts her hands above her head together, Aang follows along.] Reach for the sun. [They wave their hands and upper bodies side to side.] Feel your chi paths clearing. [Both bend over so their heads touch the ground, grabbing their legs.] Now close your eyes. How are you feeling? \n",
      "AANG: [Close-up of Aang sweating.] I feel ... really warm. \n",
      "KATARA: Good, good. Go on. \n",
      "AANG: Like there's this warm feeling all around me. This heat. [Becoming frantic again.] Like I'm in the Fire Lord's palace and he's shooting a bunch of fireballs at me! And the whole world is being engulfed in flames! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: An orange flame is seen circling around, covering the view, before disappearing. Aang gets out of his position and lands on his back, panting. \n",
      "KATARA: Maybe your stress is the kind you need to talk out. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to Sokka, in his Wang Fire outfit, and Aang lying on a koala sheep. \n",
      "SOKKA: [In his Wang Fire voice.] Why don't you get right down to business and tell me what's been bothering you. \n",
      "AANG: You know what's bothering me. I have to fight the Fire Lord in a few days. \n",
      "SOKKA: [He nods upon hearing Aang's explanation.] Tell me more about this \"Fire Lord\". Why are you so afraid of him? \n",
      "AANG: You said it yourself! He's the baddest man on the planet! I'm supposed to defeat him and save the world! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Nodding in agreement.] Life does feel that way sometimes, doesn't it? Like we're all trying to save the world from evil. \n",
      "AANG: Okay! But what can I do to feel better? \n",
      "SOKKA: [While handing Aang a koala sheep.] Want to try screaming into this pillow? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang does so. Once his face is out of the wool, the koala sheep makes a noise at him. After Sokka scratches his head, he does a thumbs-up while nodding. Aang shakes his head so Sokka nods faster, but Aang shakes his head faster. Scene changes to Azula at the royal spa, getting her hair done. Zuko comes in and walks up to her. \n",
      "AZULA: Hello, Zuzu. If you've come for a royal hair-combing, I'm afraid you'll have to wait. \n",
      "ZUKO: So I guess there's a big war meeting coming up, huh? And apparently I'm not welcome there. \n",
      "AZULA: What do you mean? Of course you're welcome there! \n",
      "ZUKO: Oh, yeah?! I guess that's why no one bothered to tell me about it! \n",
      "AZULA: Oh, Zuko. Don't be so dramatic. I'm certain Dad wants you there. You probably just weren't invited because it's so obvious you're supposed to be there. \n",
      "ZUKO: Well, were you invited? \n",
      "AZULA: Of course! I'm the princess. \n",
      "ZUKO: And I'm the prince! \n",
      "AZULA: Exactly, so stop acting like a paranoid child! Just go to the meeting. \n",
      "ZUKO: Forget it! I'm not going! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko turns around and walks away. The scene changes to Aang lying down on some pillars. \n",
      "TOPH: All right! What you need is a good old-fashioned back pounding to relieve your stress. \n",
      "AANG: [Looking up at her.] Pound away. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph begins stomping fiercely, causing the pillars to move up and down in various order. \n",
      "AANG: [The pillars causing him pain.] Ow! Toph ... I ... think ... this ... is ... bruising ... me! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph stops, and Aang begins sliding to the left, off the pillars. \n",
      "TOPH: Sorry. I forgot you had baby skin. [Aang grabs onto the edge of the pillars and gets up.] Well, there's one other thing we can try. [She stomps the ground, sending a distant boar-q-pine to her. She catches it and holds it out to Aang with a wide grin.] Acupuncture! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The boar-q-pine's quills stick out, and Aang runs away. Scene changes back to the Fire Nation Palace, where Zuko is looking out a window. Mai comes up to him. \n",
      "MAI: Zuko, it's just a dumb meeting. Who cares? \n",
      "ZUKO: I don't. \n",
      "MAI: Well, good. You shouldn't. I mean, why would you even want to go? Just think about how things went the last meeting you went to. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Sighs.] I know. \n",
      "MAI: You know what will make you feel better? [Zuko turns his head slightly.] Ordering some servants around. I might be hungry for a whole tray of fruit tarts. And maybe a little palanquin ride around town. Double time. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She turns Zuko's face to look at her, but he quickly looks away, making Mai let go of him. Scene changes back to the Black Cliffs. Aang is sitting up, holding his knees. \n",
      "AANG: Thanks for everything, guys. \n",
      "KATARA: So, do you feel less stressed? Ready for a good night's sleep? \n",
      "AANG: [He turns his head away.] Uh, I kinda think I sorta might slightly feel a little better. [He looks back at his friends.] Maybe. \n",
      "SOKKA: Then our work here is done. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka, Katara, and Toph stretch and yawn before lying down. Aang slowly lies down, and closes his eyes, leading to another dream. It begins with a thunderstorm, with Aang riding on Appa through it. They fly by a giant Momo, who tries hitting them down, and grabs them in his hand. It changes to an image of the Fire Nation Royal Palace, and Aang emerges in the water, and is pushed forward into the palace. He looks in all directions, waiting for something to happen. Toph is seen rotating around. Her bangs move to reveal that her eyes are blank. She falls down under the floor in front of Aang, who becomes scared. Sokka tries running away, but some wet earth closes around him. Katara is seen surrounded by fire. Aang tries to go save her, but his feet are frozen to the ground. Ice crawls up his body, and he reaches out, but he's completely frozen. The ground that he was on becomes completely ice. Ozai, as a fire monster, begins laughing and melts the ice, which makes Aang fall down. He is released from his form and falls into some water, where he sinks to the bottom and looks through the floor, seeing Zuko as if he was standing above. The comet is seen passing by behind Zuko. Aang is seen still holding his breath. The comet is shown rushing down. Momo is seen telling someone to be quiet. Aang is standing on grass and seeing bushes and mountains when the comet strikes the ground, and everything is scorched and on fire. He quickly wakes up, screaming and waking everyone else up. Appa becomes scared, and Momo slides off him. Everyone rushes over to him. \n",
      "KATARA: What happened, Aang? \n",
      "AANG: [Turns away on hands and knees.] It's the nightmares. They just get worse and worse. \n",
      "SOKKA: Looks like it's time for another ... [He turns around and puts his Wang Fire disguise on and voice.] therapy session. \n",
      "AANG: [Momentarily looking back.] No. That won't help. Nothing helps. There's only one thing I can do! I'm going to stay awake straight through to the invasion! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang starts shaking upon this, and everyone behind him is shocked, except for Toph, who just smiles. Sokka's Wang Fire disguise falls off him. The scene changes to the next day, where Katara is doing some exercises on the edge of the cliff. Aang is pacing nervously behind her, which makes her stop. \n",
      "AANG: Invasion. All aboard for the invasion. \n",
      "KATARA: [Approaching.] You don't look so good. You sure you can't just lie down for a little nap? \n",
      "AANG: I told you, I can't go back to sleep. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, staying up all night can't be good for you. \n",
      "AANG: [Walking toward the cliff edge. Katara turns and moves a bit to follow.] Actually, staying up all night has given me some time to think. And I've realized some big things, Katara. \n",
      "KATARA: What big things? \n",
      "AANG: I see everything so clearly now. What really matters. Why I'm really doing this. [He turns around to look at Katara.] I'm doing it to save the world. But more than that. I'm doing it for the people I love. [Side shot of Aang and Katara near each other.] I'm doing it for you, Katara. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, what are you saying? \n",
      "AANG: I'm saying, I love you! [He kisses her. After he pulls back, she embraces and kisses him back.] \n",
      "KATARA: [After kissing for a while she pulls back, whispering slightly.] What are we doing? \n",
      "AANG: What our hearts have been telling us to do for a long, long time. Baby, [He moves Katara down to the side.] you're my forever girl. [Aang puckers up his lips for another kiss.] \n",
      "KATARA: Aang! [Aang realizes he was just daydreaming, and realizes he is not holding Katara anymore.] I was just saying you should take a nap. \n",
      "AANG: [He quickly turns around to face Katara.] Oh, I guess I kinda drifted off into a daydream. \n",
      "KATARA: What was your dream about? \n",
      "AANG: [He pauses to think for a moment.] Uh, living underwater? \n",
      "KATARA: [Initially confused, she smiles back.] Sounds neat! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang nervously laughs. Katara walks away, and he lets out a sigh of relief. The scene changes back to Mai's house. Zuko is lying down on the arm of the couch, while Mai is making tea. Just as she is about to give him a cup, someone calls for him. \n",
      "SERVANT: Prince Zuko, [He bows before the prince.] everyone's waiting for you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Mai and Zuko walk over to the servant to see what he's talking about. \n",
      "ZUKO: What? \n",
      "SERVANT: The high admirals, the high generals, the war ministers, and the princess have all arrived. You're the only person missing. \n",
      "ZUKO: So, my dad wants me at the meeting? \n",
      "SERVANT: The Fire Lord said he would not start until you arrived, sir. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko smiles, and looks at Mai, who is also smiling. The scene changes back to the Black Cliffs, where Aang is hiding behind a bush in his Fire Nation uniform. He jumps out and rolls behind a rock, before stepping up from behind the rock. \n",
      "AANG: Put 'em up, Fire Lord! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang jumps out from behind the rock and starts shooting air blasts at the noodle picture of Fire Lord Ozai tied to a tree. One of the shots goes too far and hits Sokka, who is working on a golden arrow. \n",
      "SOKKA: Hey! I'm tryin' build Appa some armor here so he doesn't have to go into the invasion naked. He's your bison. \n",
      "AANG: [Standing in front of the \"Ozai\" tree in a fighting stance.] Ozai's defense is impeccable. I'll have to try a different approach. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang jumps up and shoots more air blasts, but they all miss. Aang lands on his feet and looks at the picture. Only a leaf falls. Aang runs up in front of the picture. \n",
      "AANG: You think you're untouchable, don't you, Mr. Fire Lord? \n",
      "MOMO: [Off-screen.] Boy, you are really starting to lose it, kid. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang quickly becomes surprised upon hearing the voice, and quickly turns around to face Momo. \n",
      "AANG: Momo, did you hear something? [Turns back.] \n",
      "MOMO: [Off-screen.] No, but I said something. [Aang becomes shocked and gets close to Momo.] You, my friend, are just a few plums short of a fruit pie. [Aang stares at Momo in disbelief, his jaw wide open. He quickly stands up, shakes his head, and covers his eyes. He peeks through them, at which point Momo begins chittering normally again. Aang walks up to him and pets him.] \n",
      "AANG: That's more like it. I'm so tired that for a second there, I imagined you were talking to me. [Momo tilts his head in confusion. Everyone is seen walking forward and watching Aang.] Oh, Momo, let me explain. [Aang begins chattering like Momo. Katara and Sokka share a look of confusion, as Toph merely stands there with a slightly annoyed look. Momo chitters back, in which Aang laughs before chittering again. Katara interrupts him.] \n",
      "KATARA: Aang? We're all starting to get a little worried about you. \n",
      "SOKKA: You've been awake too long. \n",
      "TOPH: And you're acting downright weird. \n",
      "APPA: You've got to take care of yourself. You can't go on like this. \n",
      "AANG: [Sighs.] Look, I appreciate what you guys are saying, but the stress and the nightmares. They were just too much. Staying awake is the best way for me to deal with it. \n",
      "MOMO: [Standing and pointing at Appa.] Yeah! Leave the kid alone! \n",
      "APPA: [Pointing back.] Hey, who asked you? [The two begin to fight.] \n",
      "AANG: You guys, come on. \n",
      "APPA: No! I am sick of this guy always mouthing me and telling me what to do! \n",
      "MOMO: Oh, you don't like it? Well, let's go right now! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang runs over to Sokka for help, not realizing that his friends don't see anything. \n",
      "AANG: Sokka, what do we do? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Confused.] About what? \n",
      "AANG: [Pointing.] About that! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka looks in the direction Aang was pointing. Momo is seen in a purple samurai outfit with the fur between his ears tied in a topknot. Appa is seen with orange and dark red armor and a helmet, with three swords. Momo takes out his one sword, and the two charge at each other. Momo parries Appa's three swords with his single one. Some koala sheep start cheering on the two. \n",
      "KOALA.SHEEP: [Cut to a group of koala sheep.] Appa! Appa! Appa! [Cut to another group.] Momo! Momo! Momo! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa takes out another sword, and twists in a twister toward Momo, who blocks the attacks. Aang walks forward and tries stopping them. \n",
      "AANG: Come on, guys. We're all on the same side. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Guru Pathik appears on a cloud with six arms, holding two cups of onion and banana juice, and playing a veena. \n",
      "PATHIK: [Singing.] Chakras, chakras, everybody loves chakras. Chakras, chakras, chakras sandwich tastes good. Yum! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo and Appa continue fighting. Momo keeps trying to strike Appa, but Appa keeps jumping away. \n",
      "KOALA.SHEEP: [Cut to some koala sheep.] Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang begins sweating. Rocks, in a snake like formation, begin to slide in and around Aang, before sliding away. The koala sheep continue cheering on Momo and Appa. The tree with Ozai's noodle picture begins dancing. A ring of rocks surrounds Aang, as do the koala sheep. Three lines of rocks are seen on each side of Aang, as Momo and Appa continue to fight. \n",
      "AANG: I just need to jump in a cold waterfall! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He screams and runs away from the scene. The scene changes to the Royal Palace, where Mai is waiting for Zuko after the meeting, who is exiting. \n",
      "MAI: So, how did it go? [They walk on together.] \n",
      "ZUKO: When I got to the meeting, everyone welcomed me. My father had saved me a seat. He wanted me next to him. I was literally at his right hand. \n",
      "MAI: Zuko, that's wonderful! You must be happy. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two stop at a picture of Ozai. Zuko gazes at it. \n",
      "ZUKO: During the meeting, I was the perfect prince. The son my father wanted. [Looks down, eyes closed.] But I wasn't me. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes back to the Black Cliffs. It is nighttime, and Aang is tired. A mist of fog surrounds koala sheep wool. Aang looks at it and begins touching it. \n",
      "AANG: Oh, look. Another hallucination. An imaginary bed made out of clouds. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Pan right to see Katara, Toph, and Sokka standing nearby, with a flock of sheared koala sheep. \n",
      "TOPH: Hey! It's real! We spent hours working on it. \n",
      "SOKKA: We made it for you. A good night's sleep will probably take the crazy away. We hope. \n",
      "AANG: Look! You guys keep telling me that I need to sleep, but I can't! The invasion's tomorrow! \n",
      "KATARA: [Concerned.] Aang ... \n",
      "AANG: No, Katara! There's still so much I haven't learned. I don't need sleep. What I need is practice. Quick, hit me! [He begins to wobble.] \n",
      "KATARA: I'm not going to hit you. \n",
      "TOPH: You want me to do it? [Sokka nudges her back.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Approaching Aang, placing a hand on his shoulder.] Listen, you've been training for this since the day we met. [Moves behind him, talking over his shoulder.] I've seen your progress. You're smart, brave, and strong enough. \n",
      "AANG: You really think so? [Katara nods.] \n",
      "SOKKA: We all do. You can do this. You're ready. \n",
      "TOPH: You're the man, Twinkle Toes! \n",
      "AANG: Thanks, guys. [He nods, yawns, and rubs his eyes. Katara aids him to the bed, where he lies down.] You know what? I think I am ready. [The other three watch as he falls asleep quickly. He falls into another dream, meeting with Ozai again.] Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord! \n",
      "OZAI: Really? You're gonna take me out? You're not even wearing pants! \n",
      "AANG: [Smiles smugly.] No, Fire Lord Ozai. You're not wearing any pants. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Ozai looks down and sees Aang is right. He quickly pulls over a shield with the Fire Nation emblem on it. \n",
      "OZAI: No! My royal parts are showing. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The view goes outside, where it is seen that the palace is up on a rock in the sky. The scene fades back to the Black Cliffs with Ozai screaming to Aang, who is seen smiling upon his success in the dream. Fade to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode starts in the Black Cliffs, with the scene cutting to a shot of three maps lying splayed out on the ground. Cut to Sokka who ponders over the maps intensely. He closes his eyes and rubs his forehead, seemingly confused. Two gloved hands suddenly appear, one holding a cup and the other moving Sokka's hand aside from his forehead to hand him the cup. The hand comes to rest on his shoulders comfortingly. Cut to zoomed out shot of Sokka sitting by a cliff-edge, the maps laid out before him. Katara is kneeling right beside him, having been the one to hand him the cup. Toph can be seen in the background, sitting idly on a rock. Aang suddenly appears on-screen, leaping into the air and landing beside Toph. \n",
      "AANG: [Momo jumps onto his shoulder; cheerfully.] Top of the morning, Momo! \n",
      "KATARA: [Rises and places hands on hips.] Sounds like you slept well. \n",
      "AANG: [Moves his hand aside in a sweeping motion.] Like a baby moose lion. [Assumes a fighting stance and raises fists; exuberantly.] I'm ready to face the Fire Lord. \n",
      "TOPH: So, what's your strategy for taking him down? [Smiling and raises her hands to her eyes, her fingers wiggling outward in a mimicry of the Avatar State.] Gonna get your glow on and [Punches the air with a determined expression on her face.] hit him with a little Avatar State action? \n",
      "AANG: [Looks down sorrowfully.] I can't. [Cut to side-view of him, the camera panning slightly to the left.] When Azula shot me with lightning, [Close his eyes briefly.] my seventh chakra was locked, cutting off my connection to all the cosmic energy in the universe. [Cut back to shot of him and Toph.] \n",
      "TOPH: You know what I just heard? [Holds up one hand and opens and closes it in a \"gibber-gabber\" expression.] Blah, blah, spiritual mumbo jumbo blah, blah, something about space. [Bored.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Cut to a wide shot of the ocean; thick fog is visible on the horizon.] Oh, no. [Cut to a shot of Katara, appearing concerned.] Sokka, do you think the fog will delay the invasion? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Stands up.] No. [Cut to close-up of the fog, five Water Tribe ships suddenly appearing from amid the mist.] That is the invasion! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to shot of Hakoda standing on the deck of one ship, peering through a telescope; Bato stands in the background. Hakoda lowers the telescope and smiles confidently. Scene fades to shot of the shoreline where Aang and Toph stand in the background by the water. They utilize earthbending to raise rock from beneath the water and form a dock. Cut to overhead shot of the Black Cliffs to show four Water Tribe ships already docked. The last Water Tribe ship is seen coming into port. Cut to closer shot of one ship by the dock, Hakoda standing nearby. Katara and Sokka run over to him. \n",
      "KATARA: You made it, Dad! [Cut to shot of Katara embracing her father happily.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Spirited.] Where you able to locate everyone I told you to find? \n",
      "HAKODA: I did. [Two members of the Foggy Swamp Tribe disembark. Doubtfully.] But I'm a little worried, Sokka. Some of these men aren't exactly the \"warrior type\". [Turns head slightly toward the two swamp dwellers.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to frontal shot of Tho and Due as they descend the wooden ramp from the ship. \n",
      "DUE: [Enthusiastically, swinging his arm.] Oooh-whee! [Cut to shot of the two men standing on the dock.] This place ain't nothing like a swamp. [Points accusingly to a rock in the water.] What you reckon that is, Tho? Some sort of Fire Nation exploding trap what eat ya? \n",
      "THO: [Impartial.] It's just a rock, Due. \n",
      "DUE: [Grins.] Well, I'll be. [Scratching his head.] \n",
      "HAKODA: Is it just me, or are those fellas a little loose in the leaf-hat? \n",
      "BATO: [Walks past, behind the chief and his family, stopping beside Sokka.] I just wish they would wear pants. \n",
      "HUU: [Cut to shot of Huu standing alone on the dock. Scratches his stomach.] Pants are an illusion, and so is death. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to shot of the Hakoda, Katara, and Bato appearing less than reassured; Sokka, on the other hand, grins widely. Scene fades to far shot of Katara, Aang, Toph, and several Foggy Swamp members clustered by the shore, talking among themselves. A pair of legs appears on screen, boasting Earth Kingdom clothing. A voice speaks. \n",
      "HARU: [Off-screen.] Hi, Katara. [Cut to close-up of the figure who reveals himself to be Haru; he smiles, now sporting a small mustache and goatee.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Cut to zoomed out shot of Haru.] Haru! [Runs over and embraces him.] It's so good to see you! \n",
      "AANG: [Appears on screen with Toph.] Toph, this is Haru. When we met him, his town was controlled by the Fire Nation. So he had to hide his earthbending. \n",
      "HARU: [With Katara resting a hand on his shoulder.] Katara inspired me and my father to take back our village. [Turns to Katara who blushes and looks away.] \n",
      "TYRO: [Tyro appears and lays his hands on Haru's and Katara's shoulders.] You helped us find our courage, Katara. [Katara turns to him.] Now we're here to help you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph suddenly senses someone on her left. She angrily turns and takes a fighting stance. \n",
      "TOPH: No way! Is that- \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She is lifted off the ground by two big arms. The camera shows that the arms actually belong to the Big Bad Hippo, a former competitor at Earth Rumble VI. He is joined by the Boulder, another former competitor. The Hippo hugs Toph. \n",
      "BIG.BAD.HIPPO: Hippo happy to see Blind Bandit! \n",
      "TOPH: [Angrily.] You guys here for a rematch? \n",
      "THE.BOULDER: Negatory. The Boulder and The Hippo no longer fight for others' entertainment. Now, we fight for our kingdom! \n",
      "TOPH: [Smiling.] Sweet. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera cuts to Sokka, while The Hippo puts Toph down. He turns to his dad. Suddenly, a bomb explodes on a boat, making Sokka, Hakoda, and Aang run toward it. The mechanist appears from below deck, coughing. Teo leaves the boat, followed immediately by his father, and Pipsqueak carrying The Duke on his shoulder. \n",
      "SOKKA: Was that a new invention? \n",
      "MECHANIST: [Teo licking his fingers clean.] Yes, but unfortunately the incendiary capabilities of peanut sauce prove to be a failure. \n",
      "SOKKA: [The others seems disgusted.] You're making peanut sauce bombs? \n",
      "PIPSQUEAK: They're destructive. \n",
      "THE.DUKE: And delicious. [They both lick the sauce that splashed all over their faces. Momo flies over to Pipsqueak and starts licking his face, much to his and The Duke's amusement.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Where you able to complete work on the plans I send you? \n",
      "MECHANIST: Yes, I was, and I think the Fire Nation will be quite surprised. \n",
      "TEO: Aang, my dad and I made this for you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Hands a staff to Aang. Aang taps it on the ground and it opens, revealing a brand new glider. \n",
      "AANG: A new glider! This is amazing! \n",
      "MECHANIST: And as a special feature, I added the snack compartment. [Rotates the handle, making the snacks come out.] \n",
      "AANG: Oh ... well, I'm sure that will come in handy. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to the Fire Nation prison where Iroh was sent to. \n",
      "WARDEN.POON: I bet you're tired of being in this cell old man. Well too bad. [Camera shows Iroh's face.] You're never stepping outside these walls again. \n",
      "MING: [Enters.] Breakfast. \n",
      "WARDEN.POON: [Stands.] Careful, Ming, don't get too close. His stench will knock you right out. [Leaves, laughing.] \n",
      "MING: [Looks at Poon contemptuously and approaches Iroh.] I snuck in some white jade tea. I know you like rare teas. \n",
      "IROH: [Ming places the tray of tea inside Iroh's cell.] Thank you, Ming. Ever since I was put in here, you have been very kind to me. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to show a very nervous Sokka standing on a podium with his father and Team Avatar \n",
      "HAKODA: Don't worry, you'll do great. \n",
      "SOKKA: Good morning everyone. Ahh! [Trips on stage.] Umm ... so, as you know, today, we're invading the Fire Nation! I mean I know you know that because otherwise why else would you be here? [Laughs nervously.] Uh anyway, [Dropping scrolls. Unraveling one on a board.] the Fire Lord's palace is here [Points at map, realizing it isn't the map, flips the chart several times until it is the map.]. Uh nope, uh wait, uh wait, uh wait, it's here, [Brief shot of Due scratching his head.] and uh, there's an eclipse today and Aang's gonna fight the Fire Lord and the firebenders won't have any fire to use so that's good for us! [Brief shot of Teo and the mechanist looking on.] And ... um ... I'm sorry let me start at the beginning [Stands up straight, and begins talking very fast.]. Katara and I discovered Aang frozen in an iceberg, now I didn't like Aang at first but grew to love him over time, then we went to the Southern Air Temple where Aang used to live and then we met Suki, [Water Tribe warrior yawns.] who's a Kyoshi warrior. She dressed me like a woman and then she kissed me, and then Aang's friend was a crazy old king and ... \n",
      "KATARA: [Cut to Katara speaking over Sokka as he continues talking.] Wow, when he says the beginning he means the beginning beginning. [Hakoda gets up and approaches Sokka.] \n",
      "SOKKA: ... And then Katara got Haru arrested and then now he's grown a mustache which if you look at him in the front row you can see it ... \n",
      "HAKODA: [Interrupting.] Thank you, Sokka. It's okay why don't you take a break? [Sokka leaves the stage to sit down, disappointed in himself. Hakoda addresses the crowd.] Let me just clarify a few points for everyone. [Shot of Haru stroking his chin. Everyone pays attention to Hakoda.] Today, is the day of black sun, and I want to thank you all for your self-sacrifice, and your courage. There are two steps to the invasion, a naval stage, and then a land stage. [Shot of Sokka looking down, sad, Katara, Momo and Aang looking at Hakoda and Toph.] To gain sea access to the Fire Nation capital, we need to get past our first major obstacle here, [Points at map.] The Great Gates of Azulon. Next, we hit the land, and we hit hard. We must fight past their battlements and secure the plaza tower. Once we do that, it's up to the Royal Palace. At that point, the eclipse will begin. \n",
      "THE.BOULDER: Excuse me. The Boulder is confused. Isn't the point to invade during the eclipse, when the firebenders are powerless? \n",
      "HAKODA: The eclipse only lasts eight minutes, not enough time for the whole invasion. And the Royal Palace is heavily guarded by firebenders. So that's where we'll need the eclipse's advantage the most. When this is finished, the Avatar will have defeated the Fire Lord. We will have control of the Fire Nation capital, and this war will be over! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The entire crowd cheers, and Sokka looks dismayed. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to show the team preparing for the upcoming battle. Katara is bending four streams of water into water skins, Toph is putting on her Blind Bandit battle armor, Hakoda is putting on a black Water Tribe helmet, Appa is shown fully dressed in his armor which Sokka made, and Aang is shaving his head to show his Air Nomad tattoos. He is joined by a koala sheep. The scene cuts again to the Fire Nation Palace. Zuko takes off his head piece and armor, revealing the clothes underneath it and letting his hair hang down. He sits and starts to write a letter. The camera cuts once again to show Sokka, still dismayed, standing on the cliff side and Aang flying up to him. \n",
      "AANG: We've been looking everywhere for you. The boats are ready to leave. \n",
      "SOKKA: I messed up, Aang. \n",
      "AANG: What? \n",
      "SOKKA: The invasion plan was my moment of truth and I completely flubbed it. I just fell apart. \n",
      "AANG: [Approaches, putting a hand on his shoulder.] Sokka, that speech wasn't your moment of truth. That was just public speaking, and nobody's really good at that. \n",
      "SOKKA: My dad is! He explained the plan perfectly and inspired everyone, like a real leader should. \n",
      "AANG: Look, your moment of truth isn't gonna be in front of some map; it's gonna be out there on the battlefield. \n",
      "SOKKA: You seem so confident about everything, how do you know we're gonna win? \n",
      "AANG: Because I already failed the world once at Ba Sing Se. I won't let myself fail again. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Camera cuts to show the fleet of ships traveling across the sea. Cut to a view through a Bato's telescope. \n",
      "HAKODA: There they are, the Great Gates of Azulon. \n",
      "KATARA: I don't see any gates. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Katara and Hakoda's boat. \n",
      "HAKODA: Katara, you and the swamp benders whip up a fog cover. \n",
      "THO: We'll sneak by them statues just like we sneak by that Fire Navy blockade! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to show Katara, Due, and other swamp benders waterbending a thick fog cover. \n",
      "HAKODA: Keep it up, we're almost through! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Suddenly a bell rings as a huge net rises out of the water and is set on fire. Sokka and the others are shocked to see patrol boats racing toward them \n",
      "HAKODA: Everyone below deck! [Everyone goes into the boats; to Sokka.] Let's hope your invention works. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Camera shows several Fire Nation soldiers climbing onto the boats. They are shown to search the boats thoroughly, but find no one. \n",
      "MALE.FIRE.NATION.SOLDIER: No one's on board, sir. \n",
      "FEMALE.FIRE.NATION.SOLDIER: Where'd they go? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Several submarines are shown traveling beneath the gates. Inside, waterbenders are moving the subs. Cut inside a sub as the mechanist is sitting at the front. Hakoda, Sokka, Pipsqueak, and Bato are standing behind him. \n",
      "HAKODA: [Placing a hand on Sokka's shoulder.] You've really outdone yourself this time, son. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Toph, who is sitting on the floor behind them with the Duke. She is getting seasick. \n",
      "TOPH: [Sarcastically.] Yeah, congratulations, Sokka. You managed to invent a worse way of travel than flying. [She holds her mouth, about to throw up.] \n",
      "THE.DUKE: [Takes off his helmet and offers it to Toph.] Helmet? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph accepts his offer and vomits into the helmet. The Duke just places his hand on Toph's back, trying to comfort her. \n",
      "SOKKA: Well, I just came up with the idea. The mechanist did all the work. \n",
      "MECHANIST: Now don't sell yourself short, my boy. [Cut briefly to Katara and Huu waterbending.] It was your idea to use waterbending to make the subs sink and float, brilliant! [Cuts back to the mechanist opening a scroll, revealing a very crude drawing of a submarine.] Though your original designs were a bit difficult to decipher. Unfortunately there is one problem I couldn't fix. [Cut to outside of submarine as the submarines swim past, along with Aang on Appa.] The subs have a limited air supply. Before we land on the beaches, we'll need to resurface. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to show Ming coming back into Iroh's cell. \n",
      "MING: Lunchtime, General Iroh. [Whispers and looks back.] And this time, I brought you an extra bowl of rice. \n",
      "IROH: Thank you, Ming. Your little gestures of kindness have made my days in prison bearable. [Thinks for a moment and smiles.] I think you should take the rest of the day off. \n",
      "MING: [Confused.] What? \n",

      "MING: No, I feel fine. \n",
      "IROH: [Brief close-up of his face.] Trust me. It is better that you are not here this afternoon. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Ming nods, indicating that she understands. She gets up and walks out. The scene cuts to show the fleet of submarines surfaced on the water. The Duke is dipping his helmet into the water, trying to wash out Toph's vomit. Everyone is stretching as Aang lands on the submarine from Appa. \n",
      "AANG: [To Toph, Sokka, and Katara, who approach him.] So, this is it huh? \n",
      "SOKKA: Are you ready for the Fire Nation to know the Avatar is alive? \n",
      "AANG: I'm ready. [Sokka and Aang shake hands and the group hugs.] \n",
      "TOPH: I hope you kick some serious Fire Lord butt, Twinkle Toes. \n",
      "HAKODA: Everyone listen up. [Team Avatar comes out of the hug.] The next time we resurface, it'll be on the beaches. So stay alert, and fight smart. Now break times over, back in the subs. [Sokka, Toph, and Momo leave Katara and Aang standing alone together.] \n",
      "AANG: [Turning to see Katara.] Katara, I ... \n",
      "KATARA: [Speaking at the same time.] Aang, I ... \n",
      "AANG: You go first. \n",
      "KATARA: We've been through so many things together, and I've seen you grow up so much. You're not that little goofy kid I found in the iceberg anymore. [Aang blushes.] I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm really proud of you. \n",
      "AANG: Everything's gonna be different after today, isn't it. \n",
      "KATARA: Yes, it is. \n",
      "AANG: What if ... what if I don't come back? \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, don't say that, of course you'll- [Katara is cut off as Aang kisses her. After the kiss, Katara blushes and stares sadly after Aang as he confidently snaps his glider and flies away.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Katara, what are you doing? It's time to submerge. \n",
      "KATARA: What? Right, I'm on it. [Jumps onto Appa and waterbends a sphere of water around his head before submerging.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to show Zuko walking into Mai's room. He looks at a painting of them and becomes downcast. \n",
      "ZUKO: I'm sorry Mai. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He leaves a note on her bed and leaves. The scene cuts to show Aang flying over land. His stomach growls, and he rotates the handle of his glider to release food. \n",
      "AANG: What do you know? It did come in handy. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to show the submarine fleet approaching land. The other end of a periscope emerges above water, looking around. Cut to inside the sub, Hakoda manning the periscope. Realizing where they are he turns around to address the earthbenders. \n",
      "HAKODA: Everyone in position. Earthbenders, into your tanks. This is gonna be a rough ride. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph and other earthbenders climb down a ladder in the sub and get ready. Cut to an overview of the Fire Nation port. An alarm goes off as the subs approach the gate. Several harpoons are launched at the subs, but most miss. One hits, causing a leak which is quickly sealed by a foggy swamp waterbender turning the water to ice, and pulls the attached sub out of the water. Katara quickly responds by piloting Appa out of the water and using waterbending to slice through the chain, dropping the sub back down. \n",
      "HAKODA: Ready the torpedo. [An ice-covered torpedo is loaded.] Launch! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Huu launches the torpedo with waterbending. Cut outside as six torpedoes make holes in the underwater barrier, making it possible for the subs to pass through. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to show Toph, the Boulder, and other earthbenders standing in a metal tank. Cut to Water Tribe warriors and foggy swamp waterbenders with Sokka among them, he lets out a sigh. Cut to the subs rising from the water, being instantly attacked by missiles. The subs open and several tanks exit while the other soldiers yell and charge out. The battle commences as they make their way inland, destroying battlements as they go. Earthbenders use rocks provided by a truck containing many rocks. Appa arrives and Katara jumps off as Fire Nation tanks appear. Teo is seen inside an earthbender tank before it destroys a battlement by crushing it. Another tank lifts its front up to slam down and crush a Fire Nation tank. More Fire Nation tanks arrive as the army pushes on. The swamp benders use water provided to destroy enemy tanks. \n",
      "THO: We're a man down. Where in tarnation is Huu? [He and Due continue waterbending, launching a tank into the water.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Suddenly a large seaweed monster is shown coming out of the water and destroys several enemy tanks, throwing one into a battlement on the ledge above. \n",
      "DUE: [Waves.] Hey Huu! Where you been? [The seaweed opens to reveal Huu standing inside.] \n",
      "HUU: Communin' with nature. Takes a while to collect this much seaweed. [Closes the seaweed again as he sees a large fireball coming straight toward him.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Several Fire Nation soldiers on rhinos appear shooting fireballs at a group of Water Tribe warriors. They charge, and Sokka quickly disarms one of the riders and steals his rhino. \n",
      "SOKKA: Dad, look out! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Hakoda grunts as he turns and deflects a fireball with his shield. He turns back to disarm a soldier and quickly defeats others before jumping on the rhino to join Sokka. The vehicle full of rocks for earthbenders is destroyed. Huu, inside the seaweed, is shown destroying more tanks. An earthbender tank is destroyed by a battlement above. Cut to Hakoda and Sokka who saw this happen. \n",
      "HAKODA: Sokka, we've gotta take out those battlements! It's our only chance. \n",
      "SOKKA: I've got an idea. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka, Hakoda, and Katara are shown riding a fully armored Appa. Sokka draws his sword and slices the end of a missile launcher off. As they fly past another, Hakoda throws two bombs inside the battlement. Cut to two soldiers running out as it explodes. Cut back to Appa as Katara breaks two barrels of water attached to either side of Appa as it forms around her arms. They fly past another battlement she freezes the soldier and launcher inside. Appa lands between two still operational battlements. The three jump off Appa. \n",
      "HAKODA: You two take out that battlement. [Pointing to a battlement in the distance before leaving to another.] I got this one. Watch each other's backs. [Cut to Sokka and Katara, shown breaking into their battlement, Katara freezing the soldiers inside. Sokka uses his sword to cut through the launcher, causing part of it to fall out and explode outside as Katara and Sokka exit the battlement. They see Hakoda on the roof of his as he climbs inside. They hear noises from the ensuing fight until the launcher shoots and explodes, hearing Hakoda yelling out in pain. Cut to Sokka and Katara's worried faces as Hakoda exits, wounded, and falls to the ground.] \n",
      "KATARA: Dad? \n",
      "SOKKA: Dad! [The two run to his side.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera cuts again to show Zuko kneeling at a painting of his mother. \n",
      "ZUKO: I know I've made some bad choices, but today, I'm gonna set things right. [He rises, picks up his sword, covers his head with the hood of his robe, turns his back to the camera and leaves.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to show Appa landing on the edge of the battlefield. Sokka and Katara help Hakoda onto the ground, and Katara starts trying to heal him. \n",
      "KATARA: How does that feel, dad? \n",
      "HAKODA: Ah, a little, better. I need, to get back to the troops. [Attempts to stand but is too weak to.] Ahh! \n",
      "KATARA: You're hurt, badly. You can't fight anymore. \n",
      "HAKODA: Everyone's counting on me to lead this mission Katara, I won't let them down. [Attempts to stand again but can't.] Ahh! \n",
      "SOKKA: Can't you heal him any faster? \n",
      "KATARA: I'm doing everything I can. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Looks around before looking confidant.] I'll do it. \n",
      "KATARA: No offense Sokka, but you're not exactly Mr. Healing Hands. \n",
      "SOKKA: No. [Stands confidently.] I'll lead the invasion force. \n",
      "KATARA: Don't be crazy Sokka. \n",
      "SOKKA: Maybe I am a little crazy, but the eclipse is about to start and we need to be up that volcano by the time it does. \n",
      "HAKODA: You can do this. [Cuts to a close-up of him.] I'm proud of you son. \n",
      "KATARA: I still think you're crazy, but I'm proud of you too. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Nods, puts his helmet on and boards Appa.] Yip yip. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa flies away as the scene cuts to show the battlefield, a mess of Fire Nation tanks destroyed everywhere. Several raised battlements fire on the army below. Appa lands and takes out an enemy tank as Sokka makes his way to the back of the saddle to rally the soldiers. \n",
      "SOKKA: Listen up, everyone. I want the tanks in wedge formation. Warriors and benders in the middle. We're taking that tower, and heading for the royal palace. [All the tanks come together in wedge formation behind Appa, soldiers protected in the middle. Cut to Sokka, on Appa, who draws his sword and thrusts it forward.] Charge! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to show Aang standing on the edge of the volcano. He glides down to a building attempting to hide. He rises, confused, as there is nobody there. \n",
      "AANG: [Looking around.] That's strange. [He continues onto the Royal Palace, breaks open the door, and takes a fighting stance.] The Avatar is back! [Realizing no one is around he relaxes, looking confused.] Hello? Anyone home? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts to the tanks, which are making their way up the volcano, unaffected by fire blasts from firebenders in front. Cut to Sokka steering a vehicle full of explosives into a wall before jumping off. Cut to an aerial view showing two explosions at the inner walls. Cut to Sokka, soldiers behind him, as they charge forward. Firebenders attempt to stop them but are pushed back. Cut to Tyro running in with the other troops as Bato appears behind him. \n",
      "TYRO: The Fire Nation is falling back! \n",
      "BATO: Sokka, we're on our way to victory! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka looks ahead as the camera cuts to show Aang airbending his way into an empty, darkened throne room. \n",
      "AANG: No. [Kneels down on the ground; frustrated.] No, no, no! Fire Lord Ozai, where are you!? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene fades to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens to the invasion of the Fire Nation where the moon can be seen gradually moving in front of the sun. Cuts to a shot of the submarines remaining stationery at the shores of the plaza. The camera pans upward, revealing the plaza empty except for Huu, disguised as the swamp monster, and several Foggy Swamp Tribe members.\n",
      "Cuts to overhead shot of the plaza where the invasion carries on. The Fire Nation armies try to shoot the Earth Kingdom tanks, but they are too powerful. Earth Kingdom soldiers run about and fire boulders to counterattack the Fire Nation. A few earthbenders emerge briefly from within the Earth Kingdom tanks and hurl boulders toward the enemy. Cuts to shot of one soldier commanding catapults to launch smoldering boulders. Several fireballs are launched into the air. One lands forcefully near Sokka and a few troops who are huddled together behind a stationery Earth Kingdom tank, studying a map lying on the ground. Cuts to Sokka cringing at the sound of the explosion. Cuts to shot of Katara coming back with Hakoda, Sokka smiles at this sight. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Brightening.] Dad! [Rising and approaching the two.] You're on your feet again. \n",
      "HAKODA: [Sitting down; somewhat weakly.] Thanks to your sister. I'm in no shape to fight, but maybe there's some way I can help. \n",
      "SOKKA: Everything's going smoothly and the eclipse hasn't even kicked in yet. \n",
      "HAKODA: [Katara moves away, sensing something in the distance.] Let's hope our luck holds out. [Noticing her move away.] Katara, you seem distracted. Is something wrong? \n",
      "KATARA: [Quizzically.] Yeah. Is that ... is that Aang? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Shocked.] What? [Cuts to shot of Aang riding in on his glider, dodging several fireballs. He lands in front of the group.] Please tell me you're here because the Fire Lord turned out to be a big wimp and you didn't even need the eclipse to take him down. \n",
      "AANG: [Katara and Aang kneel with Sokka.] He wasn't home. No one was. The entire palace city is abandoned. \n",
      "SOKKA: [With epiphany; the camera shifts from a side-view of his face to a frontal view.] They knew. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to overhead shot of the group sitting together in a circle. Aang rubs his fingers along the ground idly. \n",
      "AANG: [Dismayed.] It's over. The Fire Lord is probably long-gone; far away on some remote island where he'll be safe during the eclipse. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Thoughtfully.] No. My instincts tell me he wouldn't go too far. He would have a secret bunker; somewhere he could go and be safe during the siege but still be close enough to lead his nation. \n",
      "TOPH: If it's an underground secret bunker we're looking for, [Points to herself.] I'm just the girl to find it. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Pulling out mechanism.] The mechanist gave me this timing device. It looks like we've got about ten minutes until the full eclipse. Ten minutes to find the Fire Lord. \n",
      "AANG: We can still do this. We can still win the day. \n",
      "KATARA: [Worried.] Wait! If they knew we were coming it could all be a trap. [Looks at the others; the camera pans to the right.] Maybe we should use the time we have left to make sure we all get out of here safely. \n",
      "HAKODA: Everyone who's here today came prepared to risk everything for this mission. They know what's at stake. If there's still a chance and there's still hope, I think they would want Aang to go for it. \n",
      "SOKKA: [To Aang.] What do you think? You're the one that has to face the Fire Lord. Whatever you decide, I'm with you. \n",
      "AANG: [Rising, turning his back to the group, determined.] I've gotta try. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to where Aang, Toph, and Sokka are flying on Appa to the Caldera Volcano in the Fire Nation. Appa lands on the side as the others jump off. \n",
      "AANG: Do you feel anything down there? \n",
      "TOPH: [Placing her hand on the ground to feel vibrations.] Yep. There are natural tunnels criss-crossing through the inside of the volcano. \n",
      "SOKKA: Anything else? Is there a structure somewhere? \n",
      "TOPH: [Taking her hands and digging her fingers into the surface.] There is something big, dense and made of metal deep in the heart of the volcano. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Raises arms up in the background.] Sounds like a secret bunker to me. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph earthbends a hole in the volcano, blowing up a cloud of dust. Sokka follows her into the tunnel. \n",
      "AANG: [To Appa and Momo.] Stay safe. We'll be back soon. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He enters the tunnel into a dark cavern, with Toph leaning over and surveying the area using seismic sense. \n",
      "TOPH: [Pointing.] This way! That one's a dead end! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Following her.] What would we do without you? \n",
      "TOPH: [Camera view changes to show the group walking past magma channels.] Perish in burning hot magma. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Observing the magma channels; blushing.] Yeah, pretty much. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They arrive at a chamber where magma erupts from several spouts in the ground. \n",
      "TOPH: The tunnel continues on the other side and It leads right to the bunker. \n",
      "SOKKA: We'll have to be fast, but careful. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He begins walking past only for a geyser of magma to erupt, nearly striking him. Aang uses airbending to cool and solidify the gush. \n",
      "AANG: How is that careful? \n",
      "SOKKA: I was wrong. We need to be fast, careful and lucky. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The three leap and run their way through the chamber, narrowly avoiding magma spouts. They arrive to a rock ledge, completely surrounded by molten lava. \n",
      "SOKKA: There's no floor. It's just a river of lava. \n",
      "AANG: [Spinning his staff open.] Climb aboard and hold on tight. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to where Sokka and Toph, screaming in fear, are clinging to Aang's glider for their life as they ride swiftly over the river of lava. They reach the other side safely and approach a large metal, dome-like structure with a huge door. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Impressed.] That's some door! \n",
      "TOPH: [Walks over to the door and bangs the metal with her fist.] Not a problem. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She uses metalbending, jamming into the door with her elbows, creating cracks in the metal. She steps back several feet, kisses her fingertips and splits the door wide open. Stepping inside the interior, she points in a direction. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Entering the bunker while making some hand movements.] I am so glad we added you to the group! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back at the invasion, the Fire Nation is beginning to fall back, unsuccessfully trying to deflect the attacks of the invasion force. The Boulder and The Hippo use earthbending to create landslides that collapse several battlements. \n",
      "FIRE.NATION.CAPTAIN: [Witnessing the sun as the moon begins to overshadow it.] Retreat! Everyone move to the secondary defensive position! Retreat! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Fire Nation soldiers halt their attacks and begin escaping the scene. \n",
      "BATO: [Standing from the side of an Earth Kingdom tank.] The eclipse is only minutes away. We should be able to make it up to hill by the time it starts and secure the entire palace by the time it's finished. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The troops cheer gruffly and continue on their way to the capital. \n",
      "KATARA: [Stopping with her father.] We can wait here if you want. \n",
      "HAKODA: [Determined.] No. I wanna press forward with the others. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two resume walking. The scene changes to Aang, Toph and Sokka running down the tunnels. Qin is coming down the same hallway, whistling. The team, upon seeing him, immediately corners him, prepared to attack. \n",
      "QIN: [Out of fear.] The Fire Lord's chamber is that way, down the hall, to the left, [Makes climbing motions with his fingers.] and up the stairs, you can't miss it! \n",
      "AANG: [Suspicious look suddenly becomes friendly.] Thanks! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The trio continues on their way to find the Fire Lord. Qin relaxes himself, does a few double takes, and continues whistling as if nothing happened before walking away. The group continues running; Sokka pulls out his timing device. \n",
      "SOKKA: Only thirty seconds until the total eclipse. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The approach a set of large doors. The camera focuses on a determined Aang. \n",
      "AANG: I'm ready. I'm ready to face the Fire Lord. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He blasts the doors down with airbending. They step inside where Azula is heard speaking. \n",
      "AZULA: So, you are alive after all. [Aang stares at her in shock.] I had a hunch that you survived. But it doesn't matter. [Proudly.] I've known about the invasion for months. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The entire group looks at the princess in surprise and horror. Meanwhile, Zuko stands before a small metal door, a burning torch surrounding either side of it. \n",
      "ZUKO: [To himself.] I'm ready to face you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He opens the door, revealing Fire Lord Ozai sitting on the far side of the room, drinking tea. The Fire Lord is surrounded by several Royal Procession guards. He sets his teacup down upon seeing the prince. \n",
      "OZAI: Prince Zuko? What are you doing here? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene switches to outside, showing the moon nearly blocking out the entire sun. Cut to aerial view of the inside of the volcano. Cut to the army marching onward as the eclipse is beginning. The mechanist appears near the troops and addresses the troops. \n",
      "MECHANIST: The eclipse is starting! [Pulls out specialized eyewear and puts it on.] Put on your eclipse glasses! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The warriors stop, prop their weapons into the ground and put on their eclipse glasses. Katara and Hakoda, wearing eclipse glasses, turn to watch the eclipse. The camera zooms out, the eclipse having officially begun. The scene changes to where Zuko is confronting Ozai. \n",
      "OZAI: Why are you here? \n",
      "ZUKO: I'm here to tell the truth. \n",
      "OZAI: [Off-camera.] Telling the truth during the middle of an eclipse. [Cuts to shot of him.] This should be interesting. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He sends the guards out of the room. One by one the guards file out, closing the doors behind them. \n",
      "ZUKO: First of all, in Ba Sing Se, it was Azula who took down the Avatar, not me. \n",
      "OZAI: Why would she lie to me about that? \n",
      "ZUKO: Because the Avatar's not dead. He survived. \n",
      "OZAI: [Shocked and horrified.] What? \n",
      "ZUKO: In fact, he's probably leading this invasion. He could be on his way here right now. \n",
      "OZAI: [Rises from his seat and points toward the door.] Get out! Get out of my sight right now if you know what's good for you! \n",
      "ZUKO: That's another thing. I'm not taking orders from you anymore. \n",
      "OZAI: [Angrily.] You will obey me, or this defiant breath will be your last! \n",
      "ZUKO: [Pulls out his swords.] Think again. I am going to speak my mind, and you are going to listen. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Ozai sits down, dismayed at the turn of events. The scene switches to Aang, Sokka and Toph confronting Azula. \n",
      "AANG: Where is he? Where's the Fire Lord? \n",
      "AZULA: [Rises from throne.] You mean I'm not good enough for you? [Acts hurt.] You're hurting my feelings. \n",
      "SOKKA: Stop wasting our time and give us the information. [Points sword at her.] You're powerless right now, so you're in no position to refuse. \n",
      "TOPH: [Appears on scene and clenches fist.] And stick to the truth. I'll be able to tell if you're lying. \n",
      "AZULA: [Walking a few steps forward.] Are you sure? I'm a pretty good liar. [Pauses slightly.] I am a four-hundred foot tall purple platypus bear with pink horns and silver wings. \n",
      "TOPH: [Cuts to Toph; short pause.] Okay, you're good, I admit it. [Traps Azula using earthbending.] But you ought to consider telling the truth anyway! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Without warning, the earth trap crumbles and breaks, leaving the trio surprised. \n",
      "AZULA: [Brushing off dust.] When I left Ba Sing Se I brought home some souvenirs: Dai Li agents! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Two Dai Li agents descend into the room. Aang sends an air swipe at them with his glider; however, the agents quickly conjure up an earth wall that blocks the attack. Cut to a view of the inside of the volcano. Cuts to Bato reaching the rim of the volcano, followed by the rest of the army. \n",

      "TYRO: Stop! Surrender peacefully and we won't harm you. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to where Zuko is confronting Ozai. \n",
      "ZUKO: For so long, all I wanted was for you to love me, to accept me. I thought it was my honor I wanted, but really, I was just trying to please you. You, my father, who banished me just for talking out of turn. [Points a broadsword at his father.] My father, who challenged me, a thirteen-year-old boy, to an Agni Kai. [Cuts to shot of Ozai, looking angered.] How could you possibly justify a duel with a child? \n",
      "OZAI: [Scornful.] It was to teach you respect! \n",
      "ZUKO: It was cruel! And it was wrong. \n",
      "OZAI: [Angrily.] Then you have learned nothing! \n",
      "ZUKO: No, I've learned everything! And I've had to learn it on my own! Growing up, we were taught that the Fire Nation was the greatest civilization in history. And somehow, the War was our way of sharing our greatness with the rest of the world. What an amazing lie that was. The people of the world are terrified by the Fire Nation. They don't see our greatness. They hate us! And we deserve it! [Camera view shows top profile of Zuko and Ozai through an overhead grate.] We've created an era of fear in the world. And if we don't want the world to destroy itself [Cuts to shot of Zuko.], we need to replace it with an era of peace and kindness. \n",
      "OZAI: [Laughs.] Your uncle has gotten to you, hasn't he? \n",
      "ZUKO: Yes. [Smiles proudly.] He has. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Ozai only grows more furious. The scene changes to where Team Avatar is fighting Azula and her Dai Li agents. Aang bursts through the stone wall the agents had created and the team runs toward the Fire Nation princess. A stone column erupts from the surface, which Aang manages to dodge. Toph bends two stone slabs sending the agents toward the two sidewalls of the room. The agents each land on one sidewall and send two earth pillars straight at Toph, who conjures two earth walls to block their attacks. She proceeds to send a stream of earth at Azula, who nimbly back-flips onto the throne after being pushed back by the stream. She smirks as she lands.\n",
      "Aang races toward her, an agent following close behind. He looks up to catch sight of the agent rocketing along a wall. The agent lands before him and builds up an earth wall which Aang breaks through. He sends an air blast at Azula, who manages to slip away as the blast destroys the throne. Aang attempts the knock her down by sending an air swipe, however, Azula avoids his attack, acutely leaping and flipping between two metal beams. She lands on the ground deftly and continues running away.\n",
      "The camera focuses on the princess as she leaps from one metal beam to the other. Aang sends another air swipe at her only to miss her yet again. Azula slides down a stone pillar created earlier by a Dai Li agent. She flips onto one of the stone walls Toph conjured up to protect herself before and jumps onto the other one before landing on the ground again. She begins running toward a stone wall. A Dai Li agent slides down a stone column to the floor where he launches Azula into the air by bending an earth pillar below her feet. The camera cuts to Sokka, as he climbs his way through the hole in the stone wall. Played out in slow-motion, Azula is seen leaping through the wall, hovering mere inches over Sokka's face, smiling evilly at him as she passes. She lands onto the ground and begins running again.\n",
      "Cuts to Sokka, who dodges again to avoid a Dai Li agent, Aang and Toph who each leap through the hole, one after the other. Sokka lands to the ground and follows the group. Cuts to where Aang and Toph are running side by side. \n",
      "AANG: [While running.] I can't pin her down! She's too quick! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Azula races through a door, entering a tunnel. A Dai Li agent follows close behind, earthbending a stone wall to block the entranceway. He proceeds to run after the princess. Aang bursts the wall and chases them. The Dai Li agent is suddenly pushed over by a stone column that jutted out from the side of tunnel's wall. A hole appears and Toph emerges from it. The agent lands into a crevice of a nearby metal beam and prepares to attack Toph only for the blind earthbender to destroy his rock gloves and metalbend the grooves of the beam together, trapping him. She and Aang continue chasing Azula. Sokka quickly runs up to them. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Stops running.] Wait! Aang! Toph! Stop attacking! Don't you see what she's doing? She's just playing with us. She's not even trying to win this fight! \n",
      "AZULA: [Calmly.] Not true. I'm giving it my all. \n",
      "TOPH: [Angrily.] You're trying to keep us here and waste all our time! \n",
      "AZULA: [Sarcastically.] Um, right, I think your friend just said that, genius. And since you can't see, I should tell you I'm rolling my eyes. [Rolls her eyes in disgust.] \n",
      "TOPH: [Angrily.] I'll roll your whole head! \n",
      "SOKKA: She's just baiting you again. \n",
      "AANG: Okay, so what do we do, just ignore her? \n",
      "SOKKA: We don't have a choice. We just have to get out of here and find the Fire Lord on our own somehow. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The trio turns to leave, walking toward the opposite end of the tunnel. \n",
      "AZULA: [Coolly.] It's a trap. Don't say I didn't warn you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang and Toph stop walking and turn to look at the princess, both appearing hesitant. Sokka continues to walk forward. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Waves hand up in gesture.] Ignore! \n",
      "AZULA: [Craftily.] So, Sokka's your name, right? My favorite prisoner used to mention you all the time. [Sokka stops walking and casts Azula a suspicious glance.] She was convinced you were going to come rescue her. Of course you never came, and she gave up on you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka sheds a few tears before charging at Azula in blind rage. The princess stands perfectly still. \n",
      "AZULA: [Evilly to herself.] Come and get it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: With a quick motion of her left hand, she reveals a hidden dagger, prepared to strike Sokka when he comes within range. Toph senses the weapon and pins Azula's hand to the tunnel wall by sending a rock aimed at her wrist. Sokka grabs her by the shoulder, coming face-to-face with her. \n",
      "SOKKA: Where. Is. Suki?! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to Zuko and Ozai. \n",
      "ZUKO: After I leave here today, I'm gonna free Uncle Iroh from his prison and I'm gonna beg for his forgiveness. [Cuts to shot of Ozai.] He's the one who's been a real father to me. \n",
      "OZAI: [Laughs.] Oh, that's just beautiful. And maybe he can pass down to you the ways of tea and failure. \n",
      "ZUKO: But I've come to an even more important decision. [Closes eyes and momentarily pauses.] I'm going to join the Avatar and I'm going to help him defeat you. \n",
      "OZAI: [Smugly.] Really? Since you're a full-blown traitor now and you want me gone, why wait? I'm powerless. You've got your swords. Why don't you just do it now? \n",
      "ZUKO: Because I know my own destiny. Taking you down is the Avatar's destiny. [Puts his swords away.] Goodbye. \n",
      "OZAI: [Camera focuses on Zuko walking away, the Fire Lord in the background, now on his feet.] Coward! You think you're brave enough to face me, but you'll only do it during the eclipse. If you have any real courage, you'll stick around until the sun comes out. Don't you want to know what happened to your mother? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko abruptly stops and turns to face his father. Ozai smiles. The camera cuts to a shot of outside where the solar eclipse continues. Cut back to Zuko confronting Ozai. \n",
      "ZUKO: What happened that night? \n",
      "OZAI: My father, Fire Lord Azulon, had commanded me to do the unthinkable to you, my own son, and I was going to do it. [Cuts to side-view of Zuko.] Your mother found out and swore she would protect you at any cost. [Camera focuses on Ozai.] She knew I wanted the throne and she proposed a plan, a plan in which I would become Fire Lord and your life would be spared. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to a close-up shot of Sokka, who narrows his eyes, angrily interrogating Azula. \n",
      "SOKKA: Where's Suki? Answer me! \n",
      "AANG: [Grabs Sokka's shoulder as camera pans slightly to the right.] Sokka, she won't talk. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Ignores him.] Where are you keeping her? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera focuses on Azula, who grins smugly, keeping her lips sealed. The shot fades to Ozai who continues his account of the night Ursa disappeared. \n",
      "OZAI: Your mother did vicious, treasonous things that night. She knew the consequences and accepted them. For her treason, she was banished. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Grows teary-eyed.] So she's alive? \n",
      "OZAI: [Calmly.] Perhaps. Now I realize that banishment is far too merciful a penalty for treason. [Ozai closes his eyes. Shot fades to outside where the solar eclipse begins to end.] Your penalty will be far steeper. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade briefly to show the eclipse ending. Fade to Ozai as he opens his eyes and, in split seconds, generates lightning, firing the bolt at Zuko. Zuko slides back several feet from the impact of the bolt, yet manages to redirect it, sending it back to right in front of his father. The resulting explosion causes the Fire Lord to slam into the back wall, where he falls over and raises his head, his face distorted in rage as flames from the lightning attack surround him. The flag behind him falls and the camera cuts to a shot of the room, revealing that Zuko had made his escape. The scene changes to Team Avatar. \n",
      "AZULA: Oh, sounds like the firebending's back on. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She kicks her leg in a wide arc, sending a fire blast that nearly strikes Sokka. Sokka takes several steps back as he narrowly avoids Azula's attacks. She back-flips onto the tunnel wall and uses firebending to break free from Toph's earth cuffs. She flips forward, extending her leg forward, nearly striking Aang, who manages to dodge the incoming danger. \n",
      "AZULA: [Rises and smirks.] Dad's all the way at the end of the hall then down a secret stairway on the left. I'm sure he'd be more than happy to see you now. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She runs away, leaving the trio dismayed. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Ashamed.] I fell for it! I used up all our time. \n",
      "TOPH: It's not your fault, Sokka. Azula was ready for us. She had every move planned out. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sorrowfully.] And now it's too late. \n",
      "AANG: Maybe it's not too late. The eclipse is over. But I can face the Fire Lord anyway. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Matter-of-factly.] No. I don't think that's a good idea. \n",
      "AANG: But I'm ready! I came here with a job to do and everyone's counting on me. \n",
      "TOPH: The Fire Lord knew we were coming this time. We thought we had surprise on our side but we didn't. It just wasn't our day. What we need to do now is go and help our friends. \n",
      "AANG: [Disappointed.] I guess you guys are right. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Placing a hand on Aang's shoulder.] You'll have another chance. I know you will. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to outside where the Invasion force has ceased their attacks. Katara leans Hakoda against an Earth Kingdom tank. \n",
      "BATO: What should we do, Hakoda? Shouldn't something have happened by now? \n",
      "HAKODA: I don't know. [Katara crosses her arms in scorn.] But now that the eclipse is over, I expect we're going to see some firebenders any minute. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Bato looks up and suddenly becomes alarmed. The camera zooms out to Katara, who looks behind her in the same direction. Cuts to the top of the Royal Palace, where several war balloons rise into the air. Cuts to view of the entire palace, the battlefield where dozens of soldiers stand and where the war balloons continue to rise. Cuts to close-up of the balloons, Fire Nation soldiers fueling them with firebending. \n",
      "MECHANIST: [Off-camera.] My own invention. [Cuts to shot of him.] Oh, this is terrible! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Teo lays a hand on his father's shoulder to comfort him. Cuts to front shot of a war balloon, a much larger contraption rising behind it. Cuts to shot of the entire battlefield, showing the balloons and five airships rising into the air. Katara turns and points to the sky. \n",
      "KATARA: They're back! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Appa groaning as he flies in, Toph, Aang, Sokka, and Momo with him. Cuts to Aang looking at the airships. Shows shot of him and Sokka looking very dismayed at the turn of events. Cuts to an airship; camera pans to the right to reveal it entirely. Cuts to Katara running up to Appa who lands. Aang looks at her with a saddened look on his face as the camera pans to Sokka and Toph in the saddle. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Getting off Appa.] It was all a trap! Azula knew we were coming and she's plotted out every move! [Toph gets off, too.] We've just got to get to the beach as fast as we can. [Hakoda approaches.] If we can make it to the submarines, maybe we can get away safely. \n",
      "AANG: They've got air power, but so do I! [Cut to Aang as he opens his glider.] I'm gonna do what I can to slow them down. [He tosses his glider into the air and takes off, Momo following close behind.] \n",
      "KATARA: Appa, you and I can help too. [Mounts Appa and follows Aang.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Shows front view of the airship fleet, Aang flying straight toward it, Katara coming up close behind. Cuts back to Sokka and the invasion force. \n",
      "SOKKA: Everyone, let's get back to the subs! [Begins running.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts back to Aang flying on his glider and Katara flying on Appa. Aang approaches a war balloon. One of the soldiers operating it sees him and fires at him. Aang twists around, dodging several fireballs. Cuts to side-view of him; he closes his glider and soars straight through the balloon, cutting through it. The balloon begins falling as it loses air. Katara approaches another balloon, swiveling around once and slicing it clean through with waterbending. The top portion of the balloon drifts upward while the rest falls downward. Cuts to where the team keeps heading toward the fleet, avoiding fireballs at every turn. Appa's armor is struck with fireballs several times; he grunts. Katara uses water shields to deflect the blasts. \n",
      "KATARA: We can't keep them all back! There's too many of them! \n",
      "AANG: Let's join the others! [Dodges another fireball.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of the capital as they fly away. The scene changes to the capital city prison; camera pans downward to the ground where Zuko is seen running toward the building. Inside, he runs down a hallway past a guard, who crouches in fear as he passes. He arrives at the entrance to his uncle's prison cell. \n",
      "ZUKO: Uncle! [Zuko sees a big hole in Iroh's cell and sees Warden Poon on the ground; grabs a dazed Poon by the collar.] Where is my uncle? \n",
      "WARDEN.POON: [Bewildered and terrified.] He's gone. He busted himself out. I've never seen anything like it, he was like a one-man army! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko lets go of Poon and leaves. At the invasion, the team is navigating their way down the sides of the volcano. Cuts to view of the underside of an airship; a hatch at the bottom opens. \n",
      "SOKKA: Try and find cover! I think we're about to see some bombs! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang, Katara, and Appa are seen approaching in the distance. Toph bends a ceiling of earth overhead. Cuts to undersides of the airships as they release bombs. Cuts to overhead view of the invasion force as the bombs rain down and detonate. One bomb lands very near the earth ceiling, causing it to start crumbling. Toph props it up by bending two earth columns to support it. Cuts to view of the earthbending tanks, the soldiers being shaken about by the activity. The airships pass over. The team runs out from under the ceiling. Cuts to view of the Royal Plaza, the airships flying past. \n",
      "KATARA: Why aren't they turning around to attack us again? \n",
      "AANG: [Thoughtfully.] They're heading for the beach ... [Alarmed.] They're gonna destroy the submarines! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Hopelessly.] How are we all going to escape? \n",
      "HAKODA: [Approaching, helped by Bato.] We're not. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Looks determined.] Then our only choice is to stand and fight. We have the Avatar, we could still win. \n",
      "HAKODA: Yes, with the Avatar we could still win. On another day. You kids have to leave. You have to escape on Appa together. \n",
      "KATARA: [Surprised.] What? [Grabs Hakoda.] We can't leave you behind! [Looks at the rest of the invasion force.] We won't leave anyone behind! \n",
      "HAKODA: You're our only chance in the long run. You and Sokka have to go with Aang somewhere safe. [Katara looks back at Aang and Sokka sorrowfully.] It's the only way to keep hope alive. \n",
      "BATO: The youngest of our group should go with you. The adults will stay behind and surrender. We'll be prisoners, but we'll all survive this battle. \n",
      "TYRO: [Approaching the two.] I've got some experience with the Fire Nation prisons. It's not going to be easy, but we'll get by. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Turning, alarmed.] They're at the beach already! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to the Royal Plaza, the shadows of the airships seen moving along the ground. Camera pans upward to the shore. Cuts to view of the swamp monster, airships flying directly overhead. Tho and Due attempt to deflect the bombs with waterbending; they manage to destroy some. The swamp monster grabs several more and tosses them away. One bomb, however, lands inside the seaweed figure and detonates. Steaming piles of seaweed land onto the ground. Huu, along with Tho and Due, emerge from the mess, defeated. Five bombs are released onto each of the submarines, destroying all five of them. The team looks on in disappointment. Sokka closes his eyes resentfully. \n",
      "MECHANIST: [Rising on an earth column along with Toph and helps son mount Appa.] Bye, son. [Hugs Teo.] \n",
      "TEO: Bye, Dad. I'm really proud of you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The mechanist looks up at Teo as the earth column is lowered by Toph. \n",
      "THE.DUKE: [Struggling to mount Appa.] I'll miss you, Pipsqueak. \n",
      "PIPSQUEAK: [Propping The Duke onto the saddle.] Take care, The Duke. \n",
      "HARU: [Hugs his father.] We'll be back for you, Dad. \n",
      "TYRO: If we don't escape on our own first. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Haru bows respectfully to Tyro. \n",
      "HAKODA: [Hands on both Sokka and Katara's shoulders.] We lost today, but we've never been this close. [Kneels down to face his two children.] We tasted victory, and that counts for something. \n",
      "KATARA: We'll miss you, Dad. [The two hug him.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Bye, Dad. We won't be apart for too long this time. I promise. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of Hakoda embracing his children; he closes his eyes. Cuts to shot of Aang, sitting on Appa's head, tears streaming down his face. Katara approaches him, puts a hand around his shoulders and smiles at him proudly. Aang wipes away his tears and rises to face the invasion force. \n",
      "AANG: Thank you all for being so brave and so strong. I'm gonna make this up to you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The team turns to leave on Appa. Appa moans and takes off as the team looks back sadly at those remaining. Cut to a view of those remaining watching them leave. Meanwhile, on a Fire Nation airship. \n",
      "FIRE.NATION.SOLDIER: Should we follow them, princess? \n",
      "AZULA: No, they're too fast. It doesn't matter. They'll be back. [Smiles evilly.] \n",
      "AANG: [Looking at the airship in the distance then looks ahead.] I know just the place for us to go where we'll be safe for a while. The Western Air Temple! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa flies away in the distance. A war balloon approaches from behind. Cuts to Zuko, a determined look on his face as he follows them. Fades to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode begins with an aerial shot of Appa, still in his armor, and the rest of the gang, now including Haru, The Duke, and Teo, searching for the Western Air Temple on foot. Cut to Toph leading with Haru and Sokka behind. Cut to Aang, Momo on his head, walking next to Appa. Cut to Teo and The Duke. Cut to Katara, Sokka next to her. \n",
      "KATARA: This is humiliating. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Looking up at her.] You mean getting thoroughly spanked by the Fire Nation or having to walk all the way to the Western Air Temple? \n",
      "KATARA: [Looking at him momentarily before answering.] Both. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Aang. \n",
      "AANG: [He pets Appa, smiling slightly.] Sorry guys, but Appa gets tired carrying all these people. \n",

      "TEO: I wonder how the rest of the troops are. \n",

      "AANG: No, she's right. We are here! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka looks around before shrugging. Cut to the front of the gang as the camera pans down, revealing the temple, hidden under the cliff. \n",
      "TOPH: Wow ... it's amazing! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: At another part of the temple, Zuko descends down a rope and swings back and forth twice before jumping down. When he lands on the ground, he has a flashback to three years ago, just after his banishment. Cut to a frontal shot of the cliff similar to the one Toph and the group were on earlier. Camera pans down to show the various natural structures through the mist of the temple. \n",
      "IROH: What a stunning view. \n",

      "ZUKO: The only view I'm interested in seeing is the Avatar in chains. \n",
      "IROH: You know, the Avatar hasn't been seen for one hundred years. The chances of finding him here are very slim. [Cut to a shot of Zuko's bandaged side.] \n",
      "ZUKO: [Determined.] First we'll check each of the air temples, then we'll scour the world, searching even the most remote locations until we find him. \n",
      "IROH: Prince Zuko, it's only been a week since your banishment. You should take some time to heal and rest. \n",
      "ZUKO: What else would I expect to hear from the laziest man in the Fire Nation? [Iroh sighs.] The only way to regain my honor is to find the Avatar, so I will. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Iroh walks away as the flashback ends, fading to Zuko who looks disappointed in himself. Zuko notices Appa flying nearby and hides quickly. He subsequently runs off. Cut back to Team Avatar. \n",
      "TEO: It's so different from the Northern Air Temple. I wonder if there are any secret rooms. \n",
      "HARU: [Running off to explore.] Let's go check it out! \n",

      "AANG: Why can't I go? \n",
      "KATARA: We need to decide what we're gonna do now, and since you're the Avatar, maybe you should be a part of this. \n",
      "AANG: [Sitting down.] Fair enough. So, what's the new plan? \n",
      "SOKKA: Well, if you ask me, the new plan is the old plan! You just need to master all four elements and confront the Fire Lord before the comet comes. \n",
      "AANG: [Sarcastically.] Oh, yeah. That's great, no problem. I'll just do that. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, no one said it's going to be easy. \n",
      "AANG: Well, it's not even gonna be possible! Where am I supposed to get a firebending teacher? \n",
      "KATARA: We could look for Jeong Jeong! \n",
      "AANG: [Shooting her idea down.] Yeah ... right. [He lays down on the bench without a care.] Like we'll ever run into Jeong Jeong again. \n",
      "TOPH: [Curiously.] Who's ... oh, [She folds her arms irritably.] never mind. If it's important I'll find out. \n",
      "AANG: Oh well, guess we can't come up with anybody. Why don't we just take a nice tour around the temple? [He and Momo fly off.] \n",
      "TOPH: What's up with him? \n",
      "SOKKA: There's gotta be someone who can teach him firebending. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara and Toph look down dejectedly as the camera slowly pans up and fades to a smiling Zuko in a forested area with his tent. \n",
      "ZUKO: Hello ... [Raises an arm in greeting.] Zuko here, but I guess [Rubs his hand against the back of his head nervously.] you probably already know me, sort of. Uhhh ... so, the thing is I have a lot of firebending experience, and I'm [Places an arm on his chest with pride.] considered to be pretty good at it. [He continues smiling.] Well, you've seen it, you know, when I was attacking you. [His eyes widen.] Uhhh ... yeah, I guess [Places his fingers against his forehead in embarrassment.] I should apologize for that. But anyway, [Waves an arm to the side dismissively.] I'm good now. [Clenches both fists and places one on his chest while the other arm is raised.] I mean, I thought I was good before, but I realize I was bad, [He gets visibly uncomfortable and drops his arms into a slouch.] but anyway, I think it's time I joined your group and taught [Straightens up with a sincere expression on his face.] the Avatar firebending. [A badgerfrog croaks at him. Angrily.] Well, what's your answer? [The badgerfrog hops on his head before hopping away.] Yeah ... that's what I'd say, too. How am I supposed to convince these people that I'm on their side? What would Uncle do? [Imitating Iroh.] Zuko, you have to look within yourself to save yourself from your other self. Only then will your true self, reveal itself. [Normal voice.] Even when I'm talking for him I can't figure out what he means. What would Azula do? [Imitating Azula.] Listen, Avatar, I can join your group, or I can do something unspeakably horrible to you and your friends. Your choice. [Normal voice. Stops and sits down.] I guess I'm just not that good at impersonations. \n",

      "SOKKA: Aang, I think we should be making some plans about our future! \n",
      "AANG: Okay, we can do that while I show you the giant Pai Sho table! Oh, you're gonna love the all-day echo chamber! \n",
      "TOPH: [Cut to a close up of Toph as she turns serious.] I think that'll have to wait. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph points behind herself, and the camera zooms out to show Team Avatar looking at her quizzically. Appa moves out of the way to reveal a shadow, and as the camera pans up, it is revealed to belong to Zuko. Cut to a close-up of the team as they look at him with shocked expressions, which subsequently turn into anger. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Cut to a close up of Zuko's face.] Hello ... [Raises his arm up in greeting and waves.] Zuko here. \n",

      "ZUKO: Hey, I heard you guys flying around down there, so, I just thought I'd wait for you here. [Appa growls at him and licks him twice. Cut to a surprised Momo and Aang as he lowers his staff slightly.] I know you must be surprised to see me here. \n",
      "SOKKA: Not really, since you've followed us all over the world. \n",
      "ZUKO: Right. Well, uhhh ... anyway ... what I wanted to tell you about is that I've changed, and I, uhhh, I'm good now, and well I think I should join your group, oh, and I can teach firebending to you. [The gang expresses shock.] See, I, uhhh ... \n",
      "TOPH: You want to what now? \n",
      "KATARA: You can't possibly think that any of us would trust you, can you? I mean, how stupid do you think we are?! \n",
      "SOKKA: Yeah, all you've ever done is hunt us down and try to capture Aang! \n",
      "ZUKO: I've done some good things! I mean, I could have stolen your bison in Ba Sing Se, but I set him free. That's something! [Appa licks him again, much to his surprise.] \n",
      "TOPH: Appa [The siblings turn toward her.] does seem to like him. \n",
      "SOKKA: He probably just covered himself in honey or something so that Appa would lick him. I'm not buying it. \n",
      "ZUKO: I can understand why you wouldn't trust me, and I know I've made some mistakes in the past. \n",
      "SOKKA: Like when you attacked our village? \n",
      "KATARA: Or when you stole my mother's necklace and used it to track us down and capture us? \n",
      "ZUKO: Look, I admit I've some awful things. I was wrong to try to capture you, and I'm sorry that I attacked the Water Tribe. And I never should have sent that Fire Nation assassin after you. [Toph and Sokka's eyes widen with shock.] I'm going to try and stop- \n",
      "SOKKA: [Pulls out his boomerang; angrily.] Wait, you sent Combustion Man after us? \n",
      "ZUKO: Well, that's not his name, but- \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sarcastically.] Ohhh, sorry. I didn't mean to insult your friend! \n",
      "ZUKO: [Angrily.] He's not my friend! \n",
      "TOPH: That guy locked me and Katara in jail and tried to blow us all up! \n",
      "ZUKO: [To Aang.] Why aren't you saying anything? You once said you thought we could be friends. You know I have good in me. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang turns to look at his friends, and Sokka shakes his head at Aang. \n",
      "AANG: There's no way we can trust you after everything you've done. We'll never let you join us. \n",
      "KATARA: You need to get out of here. Now. \n",
      "ZUKO: I'm trying to explain that I'm not that person anymore! \n",
      "SOKKA: Either you leave, or we attack. \n",
      "ZUKO: If you won't accept me as a friend, then maybe you'll take me as a prisoner. [Zuko kneels down, bends his head, and raises his arms in surrender.] \n",
      "KATARA: No, we won't! [Blasts water at him.] Get out of here, and don't come back! And if we ever see you again, well, we'd better not see you again! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko walks away. Cut back to Zuko's campsite. \n",
      "ZUKO: Uggh! I can't believe how stupid I am! I mean, what was I thinking? Telling them I sent an assassin after them? Why didn't I just say Azula did that? They would have believed that! Stupid! [A badgerfrog croaks at him.] Uggh! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back at the air temple. \n",
      "KATARA: Why would he try to fool us like that? \n",
      "SOKKA: Obviously he wants to lead us into some kind of trap. \n",
      "KATARA: This is just like when we were in prison together at Ba Sing Se. He starts talking about his mother and making it seem like he's an actual human being with feelings. \n",
      "SOKKA: He wants you to trust and feel sorry for him so you let your guard down, then he strikes. \n",
      "KATARA: The thing is, it worked. I did feel sorry for him. I felt like he was really confused and hurt, but obviously, when the time came, he made his choice, and we paid the price. We can't trust him. \n",
      "AANG: I kind of have a confession to make. Remember when you two were sick and I got captured by Zhao? \n",
      "SOKKA: And you made us suck on frozen frogs? How could I forget? I had a wart on the flap that hangs down from the back of my throat for a month! \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka, I looked at it, and I told you, there was nothing there! \n",
      "SOKKA: I could feel it! It's my throatal flap! \n",
      "AANG: Anyway, when Zhao had me chained up, it was Zuko who came in and got me out. He risked his life to save me. \n",
      "KATARA: No way! I'm sure he only did it so he could capture you himself! \n",
      "SOKKA: Yeah, face it Aang, you're nothing but a big prize to him. \n",
      "AANG: You're probably right. \n",
      "KATARA: And what was all that crazy stuff about setting Appa free? What a liar! \n",
      "TOPH: Actually, he wasn't lying. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sarcastically.] Oh, hooray! In a lifetime of evil, at least he didn't add animal cruelty to the list. \n",
      "TOPH: I'm just saying that, considering his messed-up family and how he was raised, he could have turned out a lot worse. \n",
      "KATARA: [Sarcastically.] You're right, Toph! Let's go find him and give him a medal. The \"not as much of a jerk as you could have been\" award! \n",
      "TOPH: All I know is that while he was talking to us, he was sincere. Maybe you're all just letting your hurt feelings keep you from thinking clearly. \n",
      "KATARA: Easy for you to say! You weren't there when he had us attacked by pirates! \n",
      "SOKKA: Or when he burned down Kyoshi Island! \n",
      "AANG: Or when he tried to capture me at the Fire Temple! \n",
      "KATARA: Why would you even try to defend him? \n",
      "TOPH: [Angrily.] Because Katara, you're all ignoring one crucial fact: [Pokes Aang in the chest.] Aang needs a firebending teacher! We can't think of a single person in the world to do the job! Now one shows up on a silver platter, and you won't even think about it? [Stamps her feet on the ground to a point where the ground shakes slightly.] \n",
      "AANG: I'm not having Zuko as my teacher! \n",
      "SOKKA: You're darn right you're not, buddy. \n",
      "KATARA: Well, I guess that settles that. \n",
      "TOPH: Ergh! I'm beginning to wonder who's really the blind one around here! [Walks away.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Nightfall. Zuko's campsite. Zuko is asleep when he hears something. \n",
      "ZUKO: Who's there? Stay back! [Whips fire.] \n",
      "TOPH: It's me! [Throws up an earth shield, but steps back into Zuko's fire blast.] Ow! You burned my feet! \n",
      "ZUKO: I'm sorry, it was a mistake! [Comes toward her, but she begins to crawl away.] \n",
      "TOPH: Get away from me! [As Toph crawls away, she grabs the earth under her and throws it backward at Zuko.] \n",
      "ZUKO: Let me help you! [Dodges another rock.] I'm sorry! [Tries to grab her.] \n",
      "TOPH: Get off me, get off me! [Brings up some earth which sends Zuko flying back.] \n",
      "ZUKO: I didn't know it was you! Uggh, come back! [Toph leaves.] Uggh! Why am I so bad at being good? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The next morning, Western Air Temple. Katara is serving everyone breakfast. \n",
      "KATARA: [Handing a bowl to The Duke.] Has anyone seen Toph? \n",
      "SOKKA: I haven't seen her since she stormed off yesterday. \n",
      "HARU: Maybe she's just exploring the air temple. There are some pretty fun spots to practice earthbending. \n",
      "KATARA: I think we should go look for her. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sitting.] Let her have fun with her rocks. I'm in no rush to have her yelling at us again. \n",
      "THE.DUKE: We can go check for her! \n",
      "TEO: [Has a bandage around his forehead.] Yeah! I want to ride that tunnel down to the Hall of Statues again. It will work a lot better now that I fixed my brakes. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Haru, The Duke, and Teo exit. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A large rumble occurs. Toph falls down the pile of rock that she created from a wall. \n",
      "KATARA: [Approaching, with Sokka and Aang. Worried.] Toph! What happened? \n",
      "TOPH: My feet got burned! \n",
      "KATARA: Oh no, what happened? \n",
      "TOPH: I just told you, my feet got burned! \n",
      "KATARA: I meant, how. \n",
      "TOPH: Well, I kind of went to see Zuko last night. [Everyone is shocked.] \n",
      "AANG: You what? \n",
      "KATARA: Zuko? \n",
      "SOKKA: Uhhh ...! \n",
      "TOPH: I thought he could be helpful to us. [Katara begins to try and heal her feet.] And if I talked to him, maybe we could work something out. \n",
      "SOKKA: So he attacked you? \n",
      "TOPH: Well, he did, and he didn't. It was sort of an accident. \n",
      "AANG: But he did firebend at you? \n",
      "TOPH: [Sighs.] Yes. \n",
      "SOKKA: See? You trusted Zuko, and you got burned. Literally! \n",
      "KATARA: It's gonna take a while for your feet to get better. [Stops healing.] I wish I could have worked on them sooner. \n",
      "TOPH: Yeah, me too. \n",
      "SOKKA: Zuko's clearly too dangerous to be left alone. We're gonna have to go after him. \n",
      "AANG: I hate to go looking for a fight, but you're right. After what he did to Toph, I don't think we have a choice. \n",
      "SOKKA: He's crafty, but we'll find a way to capture him. \n",
      "TOPH: Maybe just invite him back here. [Aang and Sokka go to pick her up.] He's already offered himself up as a prisoner once. \n",
      "SOKKA: Yeah, get him to come back and say he'll be our prisoner, then we'll jump him and really make him our prisoner. He'll never suspect it! [Aang and Sokka carry Toph away.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Following. Sarcastically.] You are a master of surprise, Sokka ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Toph's feet as they are dipped into a fountain. \n",
      "TOPH: Ahhh, that's the stuff. Now I know how the rest of you guys feel. Not being able to see with your feet stinks. [Katara sits next to her putting a hand on her shoulder.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Meanwhile, Combustion Man eyes the gang from a higher elevation. He sets his sights on Aang. As he prepares to fire, however, Zuko jumps in and knocks him off-balance, causing his shot to be wild. Team Avatar make to run away before hearing Zuko. \n",
      "ZUKO: Stop! [Team Avatar turns their head up to the sound.] I don't want you hunting the Avatar anymore! [Cut to a quick close up of Aang looking up with shock as he is helping Sokka carry Toph. Cut back to Zuko as he stands in front of Combustion Man, arms spread out to block him.] The mission is off. I'm ordering you to stop. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Combustion Man shoves him away and attacks again. \n",
      "ZUKO: If you keep attacking, I won't pay you! [Attempts to firebend at him, but Combustion Man grabs him.] All right, I'll pay you double to stop! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko kicks Combustion Man as he fires, causing him to miss again. He subsequently takes aim at Zuko. Zuko creates a firewall to stop the attack but is pushed off the ledge. Cut to a shot of Team Avatar looking over the edge of the fountain shocked. Cut to a shot from behind Combustion Man as he faces a small crater in the floor and the smoke that is dissipating. Cut to a shot of the edge of the ledge and strafe right, revealing climbing a vine hanging underneath it and Zuko survived by grabbing the plant's root. Cut to Combustion Man as he turns back. Cut to a close up of Aang as he stands up from behind the fountain pool and runs to the side. Cut to a shot of Aang doing a spinning back kick, airbending and kicking up the dust around him, and leaping straight up just as a blast from Combustion Man explodes beneath him. The camera turns up to Aang spinning in mid air, airbending a tornado and kicking it at Combustion Man. Combustion Man leaps over the tornado and fires another blast as he descends. Aang lands and quickly back flips away from the blast, landing next to Katara and Sokka. Cut to a shot of Combustion Man falling before switching to a shot of his metal, clawed hand as it catches on a small ledge and breaks it, slowing his fall. He lands on a new ledge and rolls, firing a blast just as he stops. Cut to a shot of Katara and Aang shielding themselves as the blast hits the fountain water. The camera follows Katara as she runs forward and bends the water from the pool. Cut to a far shot from the side as Katara bends a huge wave up between them and Combustion Man. Cut to a shot in front of the camera as she descends from jumping, bringing her arms down and crossing them and giving a battle cry. The wave matches her arm movements and icicles in both directions. Cut to a shot of Combustion Man as the icicles speed toward him. He brings his metal arm over his face and lifts his metal leg to shield him from the attack. The icicles break against him. Combustion Man flings his arms down to shake off the ice shards and steps forward, an angry frown on his face. Cut to his perspective as he scans the area. The group is nowhere to be seen. Aang fires a tornado, which the assassin jumps over and fires again. Aang narrowly avoids the blast by jumping back. Combustion man falls and lands on a ledge as he fires and misses again. Katara bends water from the fountain and turns it into ice spikes, but Combustion Man appears unaffected. The assassin looks up and realizes they have disappeared but continues firing. Cut to shot of the team hiding behind a wall, out of sight. \n",
      "TOPH: He's going to blast this whole place right off the cliff side! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara looks out from behind the wall only to see another incoming blast. \n",
      "KATARA: I can't step out to waterbend at him without being blown up and I can't get a good enough angle on him from down here. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Pausing for a moment to think before having an idea.] I know how to get an angle on him! [Takes out his boomerang. After another blast, he sneaks his head out, but has to hide from another shot. He projects Combustion Man's angle with his boomerang.] All right buddy, don't fail me now! [Throws his boomerang.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The boomerang hits the assassin in the head where his third eye tattoo is, causing him to hit the ground, before it returns back. \n",
      "SOKKA: Yeah, boomerang! [Jumps up and grabs it, but Combustion Man gets up, albeit clearly shaken.] Awww, boomerang ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As the team runs back to their hiding spot, Combustion Man gears up again, but is dizzy and cannot aim properly. His next shot fails to escape, causing an explosion around him resulting in the building he stands on getting destroyed. Cut to his metal arm as it flies away from the explosion, followed by the falling building. The gang looks on, shocked. Haru, Teo, and The Duke all appear from behind a pillar also shocked. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko climbs a plant root, having survived the ordeal. Later, Zuko again approaches the gang. \n",
      "AANG: I can't believe I'm saying this, but ... thanks, Zuko. \n",
      "SOKKA: Hey, what about me? I did the boomerang thing. \n",
      "ZUKO: Listen, I know I didn't explain myself very well yesterday, I've been through a lot in the last few years, and it's been hard. But I'm realizing that I had to go through all those things to learn the truth. I thought I had lost my honor, and that somehow my father could return it to me. But I know now that no one can give you your honor. It's something you earn for yourself, by choosing to do what's right. All I want to do now is play my part in ending this war, and I know my destiny is to help you restore balance to the world. [To Toph.] I'm sorry for what I did to you. [Bows to her.] It was an accident. Fire can be dangerous and wild, so as a firebender, I need to be more careful and control my bending, so I don't hurt people unintentionally. \n",
      "AANG: [Looks at Zuko shocked, hearing these words, and thinks for a moment.] I think you are supposed to be my firebending teacher. When I first tried to learn firebending, I burned Katara, and after that, I never wanted to firebend again. But now I know you understand how easy it is to hurt the people you love. I'd like you to teach me. [Bows before Zuko.] \n",
      "ZUKO: [Bows.] Thank you. I'm so happy you've accepted me into your group. \n",
      "AANG: Not so fast. I still have to ask my friends if it's okay with them. [To Toph.] Toph, you're the one that Zuko burned. What do you think? \n",
      "TOPH: Go ahead and let him join. [Pounds her fist into her palm jokingly.] It'll give me plenty of time to get back at him for burning my feet. \n",
      "AANG: [Turning to Sokka.] Sokka? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Shrugging.] Hey, all I want is to defeat the Fire Lord. If you think this is the way to do it, then, I'm all for it. \n",
      "AANG: [Approaching Katara.] Katara? \n",
      "KATARA: [Glares at Zuko for a moment and Zuko starts to sweat; reluctantly.] I'll go along with whatever you think is right. [Aang smiles.] \n",
      "ZUKO: [Excitedly approaching the group.] I won't let you down! I promise! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang, Katara, and Sokka exit, the latter carrying Toph. Later, Sokka shows Zuko to his room. \n",
      "SOKKA: So, here you go, home sweet home, I guess, you know, for now. Unpack? Lunch, soon? Uhhh ... welcome aboard? [Zuko glances back and smiles at him.] Yeah. [Walks out of the room and meets Aang in the hallway; to Aang.] Okay, this is really, really weird. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two exit. Cut to Zuko as he pulls out a painting of Iroh. He subsequently has another flashback to three years ago. \n",
      "ZUKO: If I have to, I will spend every day of the rest of my life hunting the Avatar. I know it's my destiny to capture him. \n",
      "IROH: [Placing a hand on his shoulder.] You know Prince Zuko, destiny is a funny thing. You never know how things are going to work out. But if you keep an open mind, and an open heart, I promise you will find your own destiny someday. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to Zuko in the present, smiling at the memory. Zuko suddenly notices a clearly disgruntled Katara at the door. \n",
      "KATARA: You might have everyone else here buying your ... transformation, but you and I both know you've struggled with doing the right thing in the past. [Approaches him; threateningly.] So let me tell you something, right now. You make one step backward, [Close-up of Zuko.] one slip-up, give me one reason to think you might hurt Aang, and you won't have to worry about your destiny anymore. [Close-up of Katara's angry face.] Because I'll make sure your destiny ends ... right then and there. Permanently. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She walks away and slams the door shut. Zuko slumps his shoulders. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens with a shot of the sky from the Western Air Temple, and the camera pans below to Zuko and Aang standing on the balcony of an upside down pagoda in the temple. \n",
      "ZUKO: I know you're nervous, but remember, firebending in it of itself is not something to fear. \n",
      "AANG: [Cut to Aang, as he sighs heavily.] Okay. Not something to fear. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Cut to Zuko from behind Aang.] But if you don't respect it, [He raises his voice, as the camera zooms to a close-up of his face.] it'll chew you up and spit you out like an angry komodo rhino! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Aang's face, as he yelps in fear, before cutting back to Zuko. \n",
      "ZUKO: Now show me what you've got. Any amount of fire you can make. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Aang, as he inhales nervously and tries to firebend. Cut to a close-up of his palm, as a small cloud of smoke appears, and is dissipated. Camera pans left to Aang. \n",
      "AANG: Maybe I need a little more instruction. Perhaps a demonstration? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Cut to an aerial shot of the both.] Good idea. You might wanna take a couple steps back. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang walks back, and shot cuts to a close-up of Zuko's face, as he inhales deeply. Screen zooms back to show Zuko grunting, and cuts to his fist, which lets out a very small flame. Aang applauds at this display. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Takes a step back.] What was that? That was the worst firebending I've ever seen! \n",
      "AANG: [Cut to Aang.] I thought it was ... nice. [Smiles slightly and shrugs.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko grunts again and tries firebending again, with all three attempts resulting in very small flames similar to the first. He grunts and looks at his palms. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Frustrated.] Why is this happening? \n",
      "AANG: [Rubbing his head, confused.] Maybe it's the altitude. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Turning back.] Yeah, could be. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to some pagodas and pans below to Aang sitting on a broken pillar and Zuko standing. Zuko attempts firebending, which results in a similar small flame again. He grunts and delivers another similar blast, as Aang yawns and lies down on the pillar. \n",
      "ZUKO: Just breathe, and ... [He delivers another blast with no improvement.] \n",
      "AANG: [Gets up.] That one kind of felt hot. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Very angry.] Don't patronize me! You know what it's supposed to look like! \n",
      "AANG: Sorry, Sifu Hotman. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Raises his arms to his head, and throws them down back, and shouts in frustration, as Aang cringes.] And stop calling me that! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Shot cuts to Sokka walking toward the teacher and his pupil, eating an apple. Sokka sits down near the two, as they turn their heads toward him. \n",
      "SOKKA: Hey, jerks! Mind if I watch you two jerks do your jerkbending? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Frustrated.] Get out of here! [He lashes his arm and points to a side.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Okay, take it easy. [He drops his half-eaten apple.] I was just kiddin' around. [He gets up and turns around, laughing as he adjusts his shirt.] Jerkbending, still got it. [Zuko drops his head, dejected, and moans.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to an aerial shot of Appa resting near a fountain at night, and zooms to show him eating a small bale of hay. Screen pans to the right to show Zuko leaning on a column with his arms crossed, looking below and thinking deeply. He turns his head to the campfire where everyone is settled for dinner, and walks toward them. \n",
      "ZUKO: Listen everybody, I've got some pretty bad news. I've lost my stuff. [He looks below dejectedly.] \n",
      "TOPH: [Raises both hands to her head.] Don't look at me, [She folds her arms.] I didn't touch your stuff. \n",
      "ZUKO: I'm talking about my firebending. It's gone. [He looks below again.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Sokka, Haru, The Duke, and Teo looking at him, as the former Freedom Fighter sits up. Camera pans left, as Katara laughs, and everyone's attention is focused on her. Zuko looks at the waterbender with an annoyed expression. \n",
      "KATARA: I'm sorry. I'm just laughing at the irony. You know, how it would've been nice for us if you lost your firebending a long time ago. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Camera zooms back to show everyone sitting around the campfire and Zuko standing.] Well, it's not lost. It's just ... weaker for some reason. \n",
      "KATARA: [Holding up her bowl and glaring at Zuko.] Maybe you're not as good as you think you are. \n",
      "TOPH: [Screen pans left to Toph.] Ouch. [She smiles sarcastically.] \n",
      "ZUKO: [With an idea.] I bet it's because I changed sides. \n",
      "KATARA: [Still holding her bowl.] That's ridiculous. [She drinks from the bowl.] \n",
      "AANG: I don't know. Maybe it isn't. Maybe your firebending comes from rage and you just don't have enough anger to fuel it the way you used to. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Leans toward Zuko and points a finger above.] Sooo, all we need to do is make Zuko angry. Easy enough. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka pokes Zuko with his sword's hilt in the head and waist several times, laughing. \n",
      "ZUKO: Okay, cut it out! [Sokka stops poking, as his sword slips from his hands and is thrown above, before falling on his head. Zuko rubs his nose.] Look, even if you're right, I don't want to rely on hate and anger anymore. There has to be another way. \n",
      "TOPH: [Cut to Toph, as Sokka sits near her, and rubs his head.] You're gonna need to learn to draw your firebending from a different source. I recommend the original source. [Eats the food from her bowl.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Excited.] How's he supposed to do that‌? By jumping into a volcano‌? \n",
      "TOPH: No. Zuko needs to go back to whatever the original source of firebending is. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Seriously.​] So, is it jumping into a volcano? \n",
      "TOPH: I don't know. [Places her bowl down as the shot cuts to a close-up of her face.] For earthbending, the original benders were badgermoles. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to a cave in a flashback as a younger Toph wearing a gown is kneeling down, and crying, as screen zooms out. \n",
      "TOPH: [Voice-over.] One day, when I was little, I ran away and hid in a cave. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the younger Toph's face, as she is startled by a rumbling noise, and part of the cave's wall breaks. Shot cuts to behind Toph to show one of a badgermole's legs. \n",
      "TOPH: That's where I met them. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph cringes in fear, and the badgermole comes into the screen near Toph and sniffs her. Toph sniffs back and the badgermole licks her cheek, causing her to giggle in delight. She touches the badgermole's snout with both hands before licking it, and giggles again. \n",
      "TOPH: They were blind, just like me. [The badgermole walks away as Toph attempts to crawls after it.] So we understood each other. I was able to learn earthbending, [Cut to an overhead shot of the badgermole, which moves its paws in a sweeping motion.] not just as a martial art, but as an extension of my senses. [Screen fades to an overhead shot of Toph mimicking the creature's actions.] For them, the original earthbenders, [The badgermole comes across a pile of rocks and earthbends them to the side.] it wasn't just about fighting. It was their way of interacting with the world. [She stops crawling and stands up. She earthbends a stone and smiles at her success.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Screen fades from the younger Toph's face back to the present Toph's smiling face. \n",
      "AANG: That's amazing, Toph! \n",
      "AANG: [Cut to an aerial shot of the group.] I learned from the monks, but the original airbenders were the sky bison. [Camera pans above to show a mural of three sky bison. Aang leans back to look at Appa.] Maybe you can give me a lesson sometime, buddy. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa growls from the shed. \n",
      "ZUKO: Well, this doesn't help me. The original firebenders were the dragons, and they're extinct. \n",
      "AANG: [Shot cuts to behind Zuko as he looks at the group.] What do you mean‌? Roku had a dragon, and there were plenty of dragons when I was a kid. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Cut to Zuko's face, as he yells.] Well, they aren't around anymore, okay? \n",
      "AANG: Okay, okay. [Moves his arms in an appeasing manner.] I'm sorry. \n",
      "ZUKO: But maybe there's another way. [He walks toward a fountain.] The first people to learn from the dragons were the ancient Sun Warriors. \n",
      "AANG: [Walks toward Zuko.] Sun Warriors? Well, I know they weren't around when I was a kid. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Turning his head toward Aang.] No, they died off thousands of years ago. But their civilization wasn't too far from where we are now. [Cut to a shot of the two from the side, as Zuko turns his head toward the Avatar.] Maybe we can learn something by poking around their ruins. \n",
      "AANG: It's like the monks used to tell me. Sometimes, the shadows of the past can be felt by the present. \n",
      "SOKKA: So, what? [Aang and Zuko look back at him and the shot cuts to Sokka seated.] Maybe you'll pick up some super old Sun Warrior energy just by standing [Moves his hand in a strange motion.] where they stood a thousand years ago? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Cut to an aerial shot.] More or less. Either I find a new way to firebend, [Cut to a shot of the two from the side. Zuko turns his head toward Aang.] or the Avatar has to find a new teacher. [Aang looks concerned and worried at Zuko's statement.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to Aang and Zuko flying on Appa over an ocean. Cut to a bored Zuko. \n",
      "ZUKO: We've been riding for hours. I don't know why, but I thought this thing would be a lot faster. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Appa from below, as he growls. \n",
      "AANG: [Turning his head toward Zuko.] Appa's right, Zuko. In our group, typically we start our missions with a more up-beat attitude. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Whispering.] I can't believe this. [He lies down.] \n",
      "AANG: [Cut to Appa flying from behind.] Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to an aerial shot of the ocean, as the screen pans above to an aerial shot of an island. Scene changes to an aerial shot of Appa descending to land on some ruins. The ruins make Aang and Zuko full of awe. \n",
      "AANG.AND.ZUKO: Whoa! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Appa landing from the side. Shot cuts to show some mountains and pans below to an aerial shot of Aang and Zuko walking through the ruins. \n",
      "ZUKO: Even though these buildings are ancient, there's something eerily familiar about them. [Cut to Aang and Zuko walking.] I can tell the Fire Sages' temples are somehow descended from these. \n",
      "AANG: [Cut to some structures as screen pans right to show more of them.] Okay. We've learned something about architecture. [Cut back to the two walking.] Hopefully, we'll learn something about firebending too. The past can be a great teacher. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a tripwire, which is pulled when Aang walks by. He trips and yelps, as an overhead shot shows a small portion of the path in front of him going down and some spikes coming up from holes. Aang nearly falls on the spikes but blows a blast of air from his mouth which thrusts him up, and somersaults on to the other side, as he managed to regain balance. \n",
      "AANG: [Scared.] Zuko, I think the past is trying to kill me. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Kneeling down to inspect the spikes.] I can't believe it. [He picks the tripwire up and examines it.] This booby trap must be centuries old and it still works. \n",
      "AANG: There's probably a lot more. Maybe this means we shouldn't be here. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko takes two steps back and runs toward the wall adjoining the path. He runs on the wall before jumping on the other side of the spikes. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Dusting some dirt on his shirt.] Where's that up-beat attitude you were talkin' about? [He smiles, as Aang turns back. Cut to Zuko's point of view of the path as screen pans above to a building.] Besides, people don't make traps unless they've got something worth protecting. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Zuko and Aang coming onto the building from stairs. \n",
      "AANG: Look, this seems promising. [Cut to Zuko and Aang from the behind, as they see a carving of a person being surrounded by two dragons who are breathing fire at him.] Though I'm not sure what this tells us about the original source of firebending. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Cut to Zuko and Aang looking at the carving from the side.] They look pretty angry to me. \n",
      "AANG: [Cut to a part of the carving from below as screen pans right to show more of it.] I thought the dragons were friends with the Sun Warriors. \n",
      "ZUKO: Well, they had a funny way of showing it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut back to the both from the side, as Zuko looks down for a moment and starts walking, with Aang looking. \n",
      "AANG: Zuko, [Zuko stops walking.] something happened to the dragons in the last hundred years. [Zuko closes his eyes.] Something you're not telling me. \n",
      "ZUKO: [He opens his eyes.] My great-grandfather Sozin happened. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko walks away with Aang following him. Scene changes to the two walking on a bridge. \n",
      "ZUKO: He started the tradition of hunting dragons for glory. There were the ultimate firebenders. [Cut to them walking from below the bridge, with the screen panning right as they walk.] And if you could conquer one, your firebending talents would become legendary and you'd earn the honorary title, Dragon. [They approach a path which has one dragon's statue on both sides, and stop walking.] The last great dragon was conquered long before I was born, [Cut to a close-up of one of the dragon's statue's eyes as Zuko places one of his palms on it.] by my uncle. \n",
      "AANG: [Cut to the both from a side.] But I thought your uncle was ... I don't know, good? \n",
      "ZUKO: He had a complicated past. [Cut to Zuko's face.] Family tradition, I guess. Let's just move on. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko starts walking as shot cuts to an overhead shot of him walking away, with Aang running to catch up to him. Scene changes to a vertical column with a sunstone in the center, as Zuko and Aang walk past it. Screen pans above to show a wall with two gates, with the both walking toward them. As the both come closer, Zuko stops walking, and Aang runs to the gates, drops his staff, and unsuccessfully tries opening the gates. \n",
      "AANG: It's locked up! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko rubs his head, and looks behind, before quickly going aside to show the sunstone from the column in front of the gates beaming light. \n",
      "ZUKO: Wait. [Cut to an overhead shot of Zuko, as he realizes something and takes a step behind, and looks at the position he stood at a moment before. Screen zooms in to show the light from the sunstone beaming on a circular carving on the ground.] It's a celestial calendar. [Cut to an aerial shot of Zuko and Aang standing in front of the column as screen pans to right to show the gates.] Just like the Fire Sages have in their temples. [Cut to a similar sunstone above the gates.] I bet that sunstone opens the door, but only when sunlight hits at just the right angle. [Screen pans below to show Aang in front of the gates.] On the solstice. \n",
      "AANG: [Exasperated.] Monkeyfeathers! The solstice again? We can't wait here that long. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Cut to Zuko.] No, we can't. [He unsheathes one of his swords.] But we might be able to speed time up. [Cut to the circle carved on the ground on which light from the sunstone is being beamed. He places his sword on it with an angle, causing it to reflect the light. Cut to Zuko reflecting the light from the column.] Let's see if we can outsmart the sunstone. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the side of the gate as the light being reflected by Zuko's sword moves to the other sunstone on top of the gates. Screen pans below to show Aang looking at it. \n",
      "AANG: Nothing's happening. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Cut to Zuko, who is kneeling down and reflecting the light.] Come on ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a close-up of the sunstone as the ground starts shaking. Cut to inside the room as the gates are opened and the shaking stops. \n",
      "AANG: [He picks his staff, and Zuko, walking up to the gates, unsheathes his sword.] You know, Zuko, I don't care what everyone else says about you. [Aang nudges Zuko with his elbow.] You're pretty smart. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko smiles at Aang's compliment, before realizing what Aang actually said. Aang walks inside the dark room and looks around it. He narrows his eyes, as the shot cuts to show a statue of a man with an angry expression. Cut back to Aang, who gasps. \n",
      "ZUKO: Relax. They're just statues. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a shot of two statues from behind Aang and Zuko. Cut to an aerial shot of the room to show many statues lined up in a circle as they both walk into it. Aang walks up to a statue and reads something on it. \n",
      "AANG: It says this is something called the Dancing Dragon. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang places his staff to lean on the statue. Cut to a shot of the statue from behind Aang to show him taking the same posture the statue is in. Cut to his leg, which presses a button on the ground. Aang comes out of the posture and examines the button. He looks around at all the statues, runs toward Zuko, catches him by the hand, and pulls him. \n",
      "AANG: Zuko, get over here! I want you to dance with me! \n",
      "ZUKO: [He pulls his hand back.] What? \n",
      "AANG: Just do it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang pulls him to a side, as shot cuts to the both standing in front of two statues that are to the sides of the path that leads into the circle, as Zuko groans. \n",
      "AANG: Let's follow the steps of the statues. [Aang and Zuko take the posture of the statue in front of them and move to their right and left, respectively, taking the postures of the statues in front of them, which pressed similar buttons lying on the ground in front of all the statues. Cut to an aerial shot of the room.] Don't you see? These aren't dance moves. These statues are giving us a lesson. [Cut to Zuko moving through each statue.] I think this is some kind of Sun Warrior firebending form. \n",
      "ZUKO: This better teach us some really good firebending. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Aang, as he does the same moves as Zuko. Cut to two statues with their waists bent toward each other, and their arms in the direction of each other. Zuko and Aang perform the same move. Cut to a part of the ground detracting and a vertical column emerging from it, as the both look behind at it. Cut to a close-up of the yellow, egg-shaped sunstone on the column. Cut to an aerial shot of Zuko and Aang standing in front of the column as Aang raises his arms in triumph. \n",
      "AANG: Hurray! [Putting his hands down, and rubbing his head.] Wait, what exactly is that? \n",
      "ZUKO: [He runs toward the sunstone.] It's some kind of mystical gemstone. \n",
      "AANG: [Cut to the gemstone as Zuko runs toward it. Aang raises his arms.] Well, don't touch it! [Zuko stops and Aang catches up to him.] \n",
      "ZUKO: Why not? \n",
      "AANG: Remember what happened out there with those spikes? [Turns to look at the side and raises his arms again.] I'm just very suspicious of giant glowing gems sitting on pedestals. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko ignores the Avatar and picks the sunstone, as Aang's eyes twitch. \n",
      "ZUKO: It feels almost alive. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He tries to put the sunstone back but yells in surprise as a geyser of viscous slime erupts out from the pedestal and pushes Zuko toward the grates in the ceiling, sticking him there. \n",
      "AANG: [Cut to a worried Aang's face, as he turns to look at the gates of the room, which close.] Oh no, it's another trap! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to an overhead shot of the column as more viscous slime comes from it, causing Aang to walk back. Cut to Zuko who is stuck to the grates and unsuccessfully struggles to break free. \n",
      "ZUKO: Ugh, I can't pull free. It's like some kind of glue. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Aang, as he jumps across the slime and grabs his staff on the other side of the room. He climbs on a statue's head, jumps onto another of the statues' head and airbends a gust of wind toward Zuko, due to which Zuko is pushed from his back to his front. Cut to an aerial shot to show that the slime is rising and the screen zooms to show Aang is still on the statue's head. His staff gets stuck in the slime and he is not successful in pulling it out. He jumps up toward the grates, as the slime engulfs the room. \n",
      "AANG: [Trying to pull his hands from the grates.] I can't move! Zuko, do something! \n",
      "ZUKO: Me? I can't move either! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a shot of the entire room being filled by the slime. Cut to the other side of the grates as they groan due to the slime pushing them against the grates. The slime stops. \n",
      "AANG: It stopped. \n",
      "ZUKO: At least we have air. Maybe if we stay calm, we can figure a way out of this. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to an aerial shot of the two being stuck to the grates, as screen zooms out slowly. Screen fades to the building at night, and cuts to the two still stuck to the grates. \n",
      "AANG: You had to pick up the glowing egg, didn't you? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Cut to their heads sticking out from the grates.] At least I made something happen. If it were up to you, we'd never have made it past the courtyard. \n",
      "AANG: [He opens his mouth very widely and yells.] Help! \n",
      "ZUKO: Who are you yelling to? Nobody's lived here for centuries. \n",
      "AANG: Well, what do you think we should do? \n",
      "ZUKO: Think about our place in the universe‌? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the grates from the side, as Aang sighs, and a foot wearing a sandal steps near it. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to both boys bearing shocked expressions. Cut to a shot of the building, before cutting to Zuko and Aang as the slime is removed by aardvark sloths on either side of them. Shot cuts to an aerial shot to show the two surrounded by men and women who are in circles. \n",
      "SUN.WARRIOR.CHIEF: [Walking toward the two.] For trying to take our sunstone, you must be severely punished! \n",
      "ZUKO: [Cut to Aang and Zuko from the side.] We didn't come here to take your sunstone. We came here to find the ancient origin of all firebending. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to an aerial shot of the people, as Ham Ghao steps forward. \n",
      "HAM.GHAO: Yeah, right. They are obviously thieves, [Cut to the chief and Ham Ghao from the side to show that he is holding the sunstone.] here to steal Sun Warrior treasures. \n",
      "AANG: Please, I don't normally play this card, but ... [Places his palm on his chest.] I'm the Avatar. [Cut to Ham Ghao looking toward the chief from the side, puzzled. Cut to Aang, who stands up and gives a weak smile.] Just hear us out. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Standing up.] My name is Zuko, Crown Prince of the Fire Nation. [Looks down at the ground.] O-or at least I used to be. [Cut to Zuko's point of view to the Sun Warriors as screen pans right to show more of them.] I know my people have distorted the ways of firebending, to be fueled by anger and rage. But now I want to learn the true way, [Cut back to Aang and Zuko.] the original way. When we came here, I never imagined [Cut to an aerial shot that shows the Sun Warriors surrounding the two.] the Sun Warrior's civilization was secretly alive. I am truly humbled to be in your presence. [Cut back to the two, as they bow their heads.] Please, teach us. \n",
      "SUN.WARRIOR.CHIEF: [Cut to the chief.] If you wish to learn the ways of the Sun, you must learn them from the masters, Ran and Shaw. \n",
      "AANG: [Cut to Aang and Zuko.] Ran and Shaw? There are two of them? \n",
      "SUN.WARRIOR.CHIEF: [Walks toward them and looks at Aang.] When you present yourself to them, they will examine you. [Turns to look at Zuko.] They'll read your hearts, your souls, and your ancestry. [Takes a step toward Zuko and towers over Zuko, who looks worried.] If they deem you worthy, they'll teach you. [Cut to a close-up of the chief.] If they don't, you'll be destroyed on the spot. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The chief walks back, and Aang and Zuko look at each other. Scene changes to a building on the next day. Screen zooms to the top of the building. \n",
      "SUN.WARRIOR.CHIEF: If you're going to see the masters, [Cut to an aerial shot of the Sun Warriors sitting in many arcs inside the room in front of the Eternal Flame. Aang, Zuko, and the Sun Warrior chief are standing.] you must bring them a piece of the Eternal Flame. [Cut to the chief standing in front of the fire from behind him.] This fire is the very first one. [Raises his hands to his head and turns back at Zuko and Aang.] It was given to man by the dragons. [Cut to the chief talking to Zuko and Aang from the side as the other Sun Warriors look.] We have kept it going for thousands of years. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Surprised.] I don't believe it. \n",
      "SUN.WARRIOR.CHIEF: [Cut to the Sun Warriors sitting and the chief explaining their job to the two, as screen pans to the right.] You will each take a piece of it to the masters, to show your commitment to the sacred art of firebending. \n",
      "AANG: [Cut to an unsure Aang as he places his palm on his neck.] Umm, Mister Sun Chief Sir‌, yeah, I'm not a firebender yet. [Pointing to Zuko.] Couldn't my friend here carry my fire for me? \n",
      "SUN.WARRIOR.CHIEF: [Unyielding.] No. [He turns back to face the fire. Cut to Aang, who looks very uneasy, before cutting to the chief, who takes a part of the Eternal Flame on his hand and turns back toward the two.] This ritual illustrates [He turns around in a circle and splits the fire on his palm into two parts.] the essence of Sun Warrior philosophy. [Cut to Aang, as he stares at the flame.] You must maintain a constant heat. The flame will go out if you make it too small. [Aang cringes, as the screen pans to Zuko, who is standing beside Aang.] Make it too big, and you might lose control. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko stares at the flame and brings his arms forward to take the flame. He looks at Aang, as shot cuts to the chief offering Aang the flame from the side. \n",
      "AANG: I'm sorry, I'm just a little nervous. [He takes the flame in his hand and his expression changes to a relieved one.] It's like a little heartbeat. \n",
      "SUN.WARRIOR.CHIEF: [Cut to the chief.] Fire is life, [Cut to Aang. Screen zooms in to his face as he smiles.] not just destruction. You will take your flames up there. [Cut to Zuko and Aang standing in front of the chief as he points to a mountain from the side. Screen zooms in to the mountain.] The cave of the masters is beneath that rock. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Screen changes to Aang and Zuko walking through a steep forest, before changing to the steep surface. Cut to Zuko, who has reached the top of the steepness, turning back to look at Aang who is lagging behind. \n",
      "ZUKO: Hurry up. \n",
      "AANG: I can't. [Cut to Aang approaching a rock.] If I walk too fast, my flame will go out. [Climbs up the rock and looks at his flame.] \n",
      "ZUKO: Your flame's [Aang looks at Zuko.] gonna go out [Cut to Zuko from below.] because it's too small. You're too timid, give it more juice. \n",
      "AANG: [He climbs another rock.] But what if I can't control it? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Cut to Zuko.] You can do it. I know you can. [Cut to an unsure Aang.] You're a talented kid. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang smiles at the compliment and climbs up another rock, reaching the top. Zuko starts walking and Aang follows him. Screen pans above to the top of the mountain. Scene changes to Zuko and Aang as the reach the top of the mountain, and see that warriors are already there, with the Sun Warrior chief, Ham Ghao, and another Sun Warrior standing. Screen zooms out to show two vertical rocks with a bridge in the center. \n",
      "SUN.WARRIOR.CHIEF: [He and the other two Sun Warriors walk up to the two.] Facing the judgment of the firebending masters will be very dangerous for you. Your ancestors [Cut to Zuko.] are directly responsible for the dragons' disappearance. [Zuko looks toward the side.] The masters might not be so happy to see you. \n",
      "HAM.GHAO: [He places his hand on his hip.] I know I wouldn't be. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to an overhead shot of the chief rooting his staff on the ground. The other two Sun Warriors get into a kneeling position and the chief walks toward Zuko and Aang, takes a small portion of their flames and gives the flames to both of the Sun Warriors, who go to each of the sides. The chief turns back and walks. Cut to some Sun Warriors standing and sitting, alternately, as the two Warriors standing create a circle made of fire. Cut to Aang and Zuko watching the chief walk. \n",
      "AANG: [Turning to Zuko.] We could turn back now. We've already learned more about fire than we'd hoped. [Aang shows Zuko his flame and gives a weak smile.] \n",
      "ZUKO: No, we're seeing this through to the end. We're gonna meet these masters and find out [Cut to an overhead shot of Aang.] what's so great about them. \n",
      "AANG: [Looking toward the rocks.] What if they judge us, and attack us? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Cut to Zuko.] Well, we're the Fire Prince and the Avatar. [Unsheathes his swords slightly.] I think we could take these guys in a fight, whoever they are. [He smiles.] \n",

      "AANG: Give me some of yours. [He reaches for Zuko's flame and Zuko pushes him behind.] \n",
      "ZUKO: [Whispering.] No, just make your own. \n",
      "AANG: [Whispering as well.] I can't. [He reaches for Zuko's flame again.] \n",
      "ZUKO: [Cut to an aerial shot of the bridge.] Get some from those warriors. [Cut to the chief and the two Warriors beside him.] Hurry! [Cuts to shot of the Sun Warriors below; off-screen.] Stop cheating off me! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The chief and Ham Ghao look at each other. \n",
      "AANG: [Off-screen.] Quit being stingy! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Shot cuts to Aang trying to reach for Zuko's flame; he is unable to do so as Zuko raises his hand high up in the air. Aang continues his attempt to get Zuko's flame but Zuko stretches his arms away. Aang pulls Zuko's arm down, extinguishing the flame. They both look at each other. Cut to the two from inside the caves as the ground rumbles. Cut to the two with a worried expression. They turn to look at the other cave as screen zooms in to the cave. \n",
      "AANG: Uh oh. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Two eyes glow inside a cave and a red dragon comes out, roaring, circling around the bridge. Cut to the boys, who take a step back. Cut to Zuko, who looks at the dragon. Cut to a blue dragon coming out of the other cave. It joins the other dragon as they circle the bridge. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Cut to Zuko and Aang standing.] These are the masters. \n",
      "AANG: [In a low voice.] Still think we can take 'em? \n",
      "ZUKO: Sshh. I never said that. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the dragons circling the bridge from below. Screen pans down to the warriors as they bow down. Cut to Ham Ghao and the chief. \n",

      "SUN.WARRIOR.CHIEF: [Turns toward Ham Ghao.] Quiet, Ham Ghao! \n",
      "HAM.GHAO: What? [Turns his head away.] Everyone's thinking it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the bridge where the dragons are still flying around the bridge. Cut to Aang, who looks at them flying. \n",
      "AANG: [Whispers.] Zuko, I think we're supposed to do the Dragon Dance with them. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Turning his head toward Zuko.] What‌? What about this situation makes you think they want us to dance‌? \n",
      "AANG: Well, I think they want us to do something. Let's just try it. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Unwillingly.] Fine. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang and Zuko get into the first posture of the Dancing Dragon and change their postures to the next. Cut to Aang spreading his arms out as the blue dragon flies behind him following the shape of his arms. Aang turns his arms to his side as the dragon turns as well. Screen zooms out to show the dragons performing the same movements as each other. Cut to Zuko, who pushes his hand up as the red dragon behind him goes up as well. Zuko dips and the dragon dives down accordingly. Cut to the dragons flying above the bridge as screen pans below to show the two performing the Dancing Dragon. Cut to them performing the final move. They look to either side as shot cuts to show that the dragons have stopped moving and are hovering on either side of the bridge. \n",
      "SUN.WARRIOR.CHIEF: [Still bowing.] Judgment time. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the blue dragon which stares at Zuko, as Aang trembles. Zuko looks at it, with his mouth wide open. Cut to Aang trembles, as shot cuts to the two dragons sitting, with their legs at the bottom of the bridge. Cut to the red dragon as it breathes fire at the two. Cut to the blue dragon doing the same. Cut to Zuko and Aang yelling and covering their faces as they are engulfed by a multi-colored flame vortex. Cut to the top of the vortex from inside it. It slowly pans down to the boys who look at it, shocked. Cut to the bridge as the dragons continue breathing fire. Screen pans above to the flame vortex. Cut to the inside of the vortex and the two stare at the scene in awe. Cut to Aang's eyes. \n",
      "AANG: Wow. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Cut to Zuko's face, as he stares at the flames.] I understand. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The vortex slowly dissipates and the dragons curl their bodies, fly up, circle one time and go into their caves. Cut to the boys who still remain on the bridge. Cut to an annoyed Ham Ghao, before cutting to one of the warriors holding the circle of fire as he moves his arm in a circle, and extinguishes the flame and ending his hands in a position. Cut to an aerial shot of Zuko and Aang descending from the steps. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Cut to Zuko.] Their fire was beautiful. I saw so many colors, colors I've never imagined. \n",
      "AANG: [Cut to the two descending from the side.] Like firebending harmony. \n",
      "SUN.WARRIOR.CHIEF: Yes. They judged you, and gave you visions of the meaning of firebending. [The other two Sun Warriors walk away.] \n",
      "ZUKO: [Cut to Zuko.] I can't believe there are still living dragons. My uncle Iroh said he faced the last dragon and killed it. \n",
      "AANG: [Looking at Zuko.] So your uncle lied. \n",
      "SUN.WARRIOR.CHIEF: [Cut to the smiling chief from the side.] Actually, it wasn't a total lie. Iroh was the last outsider to face the masters. [Raising his hand above slightly.] They deemed him worthy and passed the secret onto him as well. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Surprised. Shot cuts to an aerial shot of the courtyard.] He must have lied to protect them, so no one else would hunt them. \n",
      "AANG: [Cut to Aang.] All this time, I thought firebending was destruction. Since I hurt Katara, I've been too afraid and hesitant. But now I know what it really is ... it's energy, and life. [He smiles.] \n",
      "ZUKO: Yeah. It's like the Sun, [He curls his hand into a fist.] but inside of you. Do you guys realize this? \n",
      "SUN.WARRIOR.CHIEF: [Smiling.] Well, our civilization is called the Sun Warriors ... so yeah. \n",
      "ZUKO: That's why my firebending was so weak before. Because for so many years, hunting you [Turns toward Aang as screen zooms out to show Aang.] was my drive ... it was my purpose. [Aang turns toward Zuko as well.] So when I joined you, I lost sight of my inner fire. But now, I have a new drive. [Cut to Zuko's face as screen zooms in.] I have to help you defeat my father and restore balance to the world. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko delivers two fire blasts more powerful than in the Western Air Temple. Aang also bends a similar blast. Cut to Aang's face, as he grins at his success. Cut to both of them, who walk toward each other, smiling. \n",
      "SUN.WARRIOR.CHIEF: [He walks toward the two and become serious.] Now that you have learned the secrets, and you know about our tribe's existence, [He stops walking.] we have no choice but to imprison you here forever. [Cut to the two, who are shocked, before cutting back to the smiling chief.] Just kidding. [Cut to the two as they look relieved. The chief's expression becomes serious again.] But seriously, don't tell anyone! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene changes to the upside-down pagodas in the Western Air Temple. \n",
      "AANG: [Cut to Aang and Zuko demonstrating the Dancing Dragon to the rest of Team Avatar and friends.] With this technique the dragons showed us, Zuko and I will be unstoppable. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two get into their final postures and Team Avatar applauds. \n",
      "SOKKA: Yeah, that's a great dance you two learned there. \n",
      "ZUKO: It's not a dance. It's a firebending form. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Cut to Sokka, as he moves his fingers in a dancing manner.] We'll just tap-dance our way to victory over the Fire Lord. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Walks toward Sokka.] It's a sacred form that happens to be thousands of years old! \n",
      "KATARA: Oh, yeah‌? What's your little form called‌? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Embarrassed.] The Dancing Dragon. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Team Avatar laughs, and the shot cuts to Zuko who shuts his eyes and cringes in embarrassment. Fade to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene opens to the Western Air Temple at nightfall. Zuko is pouring tea to give to the members of Team Avatar. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Cut to a tray full of tea cups with Zuko's hand holding a kettle and filling up the empty cups.] No one can make tea like Uncle [Camera pans up to Zuko's face.], but hopefully I learned a thing or two. Would you like to hear Uncle's favorite tea joke? \n",
      "KATARA: Sure. [Cut to an overhead of the group sitting around a fire.] \n",
      "AANG: I like jokes. \n",
      "TOPH: Bring it! \n",
      "ZUKO: Okay. [Serves tea to The Duke and Haru and stands up with his tray.] Well, I can't remember how it starts, but the punch line [The boys help themselves to the tea.] is \"Leaf me alone, I'm bushed!\" [No response.] Well, it's funnier when Uncle tells it. \n",
      "KATARA: Right ... maybe that's because he remembers the whole thing. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Everyone else laughs. Zuko smiles a little. \n",
      "TOPH: It's nice to get a chance to relax a little. It hardly ever happens. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko hands tea to Teo and Toph. He subsequently approaches Sokka. \n",
      "SOKKA: Hey, can I talk to you for a second? [Stands up and walks out.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko sets down the tray of tea. The camera switches to a shot of him and Sokka walking away from where the rest of the group is gathered. \n",
      "ZUKO: So, what's up? [Appa wakes up and looks as they walk past him.] \n",
      "SOKKA: If someone was captured by the Fire Nation, where would they be taken? \n",
      "ZUKO: What do you mean? Who was captured? \n",
      "SOKKA: When the invasion plan failed, some of our troops were taken. I just want to know where they might be. \n",
      "ZUKO: I can't tell you. \n",
      "SOKKA: What? Why not? \n",
      "ZUKO: Trust me. Knowing would just make you feel worse. [Turns to leave, but is stopped by Sokka.] \n",
      "SOKKA: It's my dad. He was captured too. I need to know what I put him through. \n",
      "ZUKO: It's not good, Sokka. \n",
      "SOKKA: Please. \n",
      "ZUKO: My guess is, they were taken to the Boiling Rock. \n",
      "SOKKA: What's that? \n",
      "ZUKO: The highest security prison in the Fire Nation. [Sokka looks at him, horrified.] It's on an island in the middle of a boiling lake. It's inescapable. \n",
      "SOKKA: So, where is this place? \n",
      "ZUKO: Why do you need to know? What are you planning? \n",
      "SOKKA: Nothing. [Pauses for a moment.] Boy, you're so paranoid. \n",
      "ZUKO: It's in the middle of a volcano between here and the Fire Nation. You guys actually flew right past it on your way here. \n",
      "SOKKA: Thanks, Zuko. [Yawns.] Just knowing makes me feel better. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Sarcastically.] Yeah, I'm sure it does. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to later that night. With everyone asleep, Sokka sneaks away from everyone. He sighs and almost steps on Momo, narrowly avoiding tripping over him and waking him up. He climbs onto Appa, who awakes. \n",
      "SOKKA: [To Appa.] Shhh. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa goes back to sleep, as Sokka climbs on top of him. However, as he climbs up, he notices Zuko is already in the saddle with his arms crossed. \n",
      "ZUKO: Not up to anything, huh? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Falls off Appa, his bag's contents fall out.] Fine, you caught me. I'm gonna rescue my dad. You happy now? \n",
      "ZUKO: I'm never happy. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Picking up the fallen items.] Look, I have to do this. The invasion plan was my idea, it was my decision to stay when things were going wrong. [Zuko jumps off of Appa.] It's my mistake, and it's my job to fix it. I have to regain my honor. You can't stop me, Zuko. [Pushes Zuko aside and begins to climb up Appa on Appa's saddle.] \n",
      "ZUKO: You need to regain your honor? Believe me, I get it. I'm going with you. \n",
      "SOKKA: No. I have to do this alone. \n",
      "ZUKO: How are you going to get there? On Appa? Last time I checked, prisons don't have bison daycares. [Sokka stops climbing, sighs, and looks back at Zuko.] We'll take my war balloon. [They walk off to the war balloon.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Appa and Momo, still sleeping at sunrise. The Duke gives Appa some hay. Katara notices that Momo is holding a note. \n",
      "TOPH: What does it say? \n",
      "KATARA: \"Need meat. Gone fishing. Back in a few days. Sokka and Zuko.\" [As she says this, Aang yawns and turns around to lie back down.] One more thing. \"Aang, practice your firebending while I'm gone. Do twenty sets of fire fists and ten hot squats every time you hear a badgerfrog croak. Zuko.\" \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A badgerfrog croaks, waking Aang from his rest. \n",
      "AANG: [Sighs.] Nobody else has homework. [Stands up and walks to a spot and starts hot squatting while Katara and Toph walk away.] One hot squat, two hot squat, three hot squat, four hot squat ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene cuts to Zuko and Sokka in the air in the war balloon. Zuko blasts fire into the tank to keep it moving. A moment of awkward silence between the two follows. \n",
      "SOKKA: Pretty clouds. \n",
      "ZUKO: Yeah ... fluffy. [Sokka whistles.] What? \n",
      "SOKKA: What? Oh, I didn't say anything. You know, a friend of mine actually designed these war balloons. \n",
      "ZUKO: No kidding. \n",
      "SOKKA: Yep, a balloon ... but for war. \n",
      "ZUKO: If there's one thing my dad's good at, it's war. [Blasts more fire into the tank.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Yeah, it seems to run in the family. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Looks at Sokka, defensively.] Hey, hold on. Not everyone in my family is like that. \n",
      "SOKKA: I know, I know, you've changed. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Downcast.] I meant my uncle. He was more of a father to me. And I really let him down. \n",
      "SOKKA: I think your uncle would be proud of you. Leaving your home to come help us? That's hard. \n",
      "ZUKO: It wasn't that hard. \n",
      "SOKKA: Really? You didn't leave behind anyone you cared about? \n",
      "ZUKO: Well, I did have a girlfriend. Mai. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Smiles and looks at Zuko with interest.] That gloomy girl who sighs a lot? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Smiles.] Yeah. Everyone in the Fire Nation thinks I'm a traitor. I couldn't drag her into it. \n",
      "SOKKA: My first girlfriend turned into the moon. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Shocked for a moment. Looks up at the sky briefly, before glancing back at Sokka.] That's rough, buddy. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Nightfall. Sokka is asleep, snoring loudly. Zuko continues to keep the tank full. He stops to look out in the distance. \n",
      "ZUKO: There it is! [Sokka awakens to see it.] There's plenty of steam to keep us covered. As long as we're quiet, we should be able to navigate through it without being caught. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As they enter the volcano's steam, the balloon begins losing altitude quickly. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Frantically blasting fire into the tank.] We're going down! The balloon's not working anymore! [Blasts fire up into the balloon.] \n",
      "SOKKA: The air outside is just as hot as the air inside so we can't fly! \n",
      "ZUKO: [Falls to the side as the balloon tips.] So what are we supposed to do? \n",
      "SOKKA: I don't know! Crash-landing? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The balloon skids along the boiling water, splashing Sokka's hand, which he shakes while blocking his mouth to prevent himself from screaming. The balloon hits the base of the rock, ejecting the two from it. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Looking at the destroyed war balloon.] How are we gonna get off the island if the balloon won't work? \n",
      "SOKKA: We'll figure something out! I suspected it might be a one-way ticket. \n",
      "ZUKO: You knew this would happen and you wanted to come anyway? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Walks to the destroyed balloon.] My dad might be here! I had to come and see! \n",
      "ZUKO: Uncle always said I never thought things through. But this ... this is just crazy! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Gathers parts from the balloon together.] Hey, I never wanted you to come along in the first place! And for the record, I always think things through! But my plans haven't exactly worked, so this time, I'm playing it by ear. So there. [After the hot water on the balloon burns his hand, Sokka kicks it into the water.] \n",
      "ZUKO: What are you doing? \n",
      "SOKKA: It doesn't work anyway, and we don't want anyone to find it. \n",
      "ZUKO: I hope you know what you're doing. [They both turn to look at the prison.] There's no turning back now. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Morning. Zuko and Sokka have entered the prison, and come out of a supply room filled with reserve guard uniforms. Both of them wear prison guard uniforms. \n",
      "ZUKO: I hope these disguises work. \n",
      "SOKKA: We just need to lay low and find my dad as soon as possible. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A series of guards run by. One of them runs back and looks at them. \n",
      "MALE.GUARD: Guards! There's a scuffle in the yard. Come on. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two go to the yard. Prisoners are gathered in a circle as the guards move through to the inside. \n",
      "CHIT.SANG: I didn't do anything! I'm going back to my cell. \n",
      "BULLY.GUARD: [Whips fire at him.] Stop right there, Chit Sang. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko tries to approach, but Sokka grabs his arm to stop him. \n",
      "SOKKA: We can't blow our cover. \n",
      "BULLY.GUARD: I've had it with your unruly behavior! \n",
      "CHIT.SANG: What did I do? \n",
      "BULLY.GUARD: He wants to know what he did. [To Zuko and Sokka.] Isn't that cute? [Gives them a look when they say nothing.] \n",
      "ZUKO: Uh, very cute, sir. \n",
      "SOKKA: Super cute. \n",
      "BULLY.GUARD: [Walks up to Chit Sang.] You didn't bow down when I walked by, Chit Sang! \n",
      "CHIT.SANG: What? That's not a prison rule. \n",
      "BULLY.GUARD: Do it! \n",
      "CHIT.SANG: Make me. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The bully guard walks away, but as he is leaving, he whips fire at Chit Sang. Chit Sang blocks it, and redirects it at him. The bully guard breaks the blast with a kick. \n",
      "BULLY.GUARD: Tsk, tsk. Firebending is prohibited. You're going in the cooler. [Pointing at Sokka.] You! Help me take him in. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Whispers to Zuko.] Meet back here in an hour. [Runs up to Chit Sang and the guard.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back inside, Chit Sang is led to a cooler. \n",
      "BULLY.GUARD: The warden will deal with you soon. [Sokka closes the doors.] Can you believe this guy? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Playing along.] Prisoners! Am I right? \n",
      "BULLY.GUARD: Ugh. Tell me about it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Meal time for the guards. Zuko is getting food, noticeably the only guard wearing a helmet. \n",
      "MALE.GUARD: Hey, new guy! I know it's the rule to have your helmet on at all times, but this is the lounge. Relax. \n",
      "ZUKO: But what if there's an incident? If I'm not prepared, someone could strike me on the head. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The guards laugh. \n",
      "FEMALE.GUARD: Give it a week, he'll loosen up. \n",
      "ZUKO: Can the new guy ask you veterans a few questions about the prison? \n",
      "FEMALE.GUARD: [Bluntly.] No, you can't date the female guards. \n",
      "MALE.GUARD: Trust me, you don't want to. [The female guard throws a cup at him, which causes the guard sitting behind him to laugh.] \n",
      "ZUKO: No, that's not it. The Boiling Rock, it holds the Fire Nation's most dangerous criminals, right? [The other guards nod.] So what about war prisoners? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: In the yard, the warden arrives on the gondolas. Meanwhile, Sokka and the bully guard continue to stand guard by the cooler. Sokka is looking inside at Chit Sang who is shivering. \n",
      "SOKKA: It sure looks cold in there. \n",
      "BULLY.GUARD: That's why we call it the cooler. He won't be firebending there. [Notices someone coming; lowers his mask.] It's the warden! [He and Sokka stand to attention.] Look alive! \n",
      "WARDEN: [Opens the cooler.] So Chit Sang, I hear you used firebending to try to escape. You should know better. \n",
      "CHIT.SANG: I wasn't trying to escape. \n",
      "BULLY.GUARD: He's lying! I saw it with my own eyes. [He is pushed aside by one of the warden's bodyguards.] \n",
      "WARDEN: No one has ever, ever escaped from here. I'd sooner jump in the Boiling Lake myself than let that record fall. Don't forget it. Now go back to your shivering. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back in the yard. Zuko approaches Sokka, but does not know it is him. \n",
      "ZUKO: Hey there, fellow guard, how goes it? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Lifts up his helmet's visor.] Zuko? \n",
      "ZUKO: Shhh! Listen, I asked around the lounge. There are no Water Tribe prisoners. [Lifts up his visor.] I'm afraid your father's not here. \n",
      "SOKKA: What? Are you sure, did you double-check? \n",
      "ZUKO: Yeah, I'm sure. \n",
      "SOKKA: No. No! [Bangs his fists against the wall in frustration.] \n",
      "ZUKO: I'm really sorry, Sokka. \n",
      "SOKKA: So we came all this way for nothing? I failed ... again. \n",
      "ZUKO: Ah, [Holds his chin in thought.] what would Uncle say? [Cut to a frog-view as he looks up at the sky.] Sometimes, clouds have two sides, [Walks over to the railing.] a dark and light, and a silver lining in between. It's like a silver sandwich! [Close-up of a disinterested Sokka; voice-over.] So ... when life seems hard ... [Sokka glances to the side.] take a bite out of the silver sandwich! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka's eyes widen when he notices something; close-up of his cheerful expression as he gets up. Cut to a frontal shot of Zuko while Sokka runs up to grab the railing next to him, excitedly looking down to the yard below. \n",
      "SOKKA: Maybe we haven't failed after all! \n",
      "ZUKO: That's the spirit! [Folds his arms.] I can't believe that worked. [Looks down.] I didn't even know what I was saying. \n",
      "SOKKA: No, what you said made no sense at all. But look ... [As he points, the camera shifts to an overhead view of the yard, before rapidly zooming in on a dejected-looking Suki.] It's Suki! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Suki, sitting in the prison yard in prison garb, looks up at hearing the continuous ringing of a bell. \n",
      "GUARD: [Voice-over.] Prisoners, [Suki gets up.] back in your cells! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a view of the prison yard from ground level as the prisoners start to walk back inside. Cut to a frontal shot of Zuko and Sokka. The latter's eyes are now rapidly blinking pink hearts, while Zuko gives him a conspicuous look. Sokka does not pay attention and lowers the visor of his helmet with a smile before dashing out of the scene with a surprised Zuko quicking turning his head and looking after him. Cut to the prisoners' housing area. Camera slowly pans to show a guard mopping the floor and another one doing his rounds. Cut to Suki lying on her bed and staring at the ceiling in sadness. The door to her cell opens and closes, illuminating her face as her eyes turn to the door. Cut to a further off side-shot of Sokka entering Suki's cell. \n",
      "SUKI: [Sits up; aggressively.] What is it? Did I do something wrong? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Crosses arms.] You mean you don't recognize me? \n",
      "SUKI: [Close-up. She averts her eyes; bitterly.] You people all look the same to me. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Frontal shot; smugly.] Oh? Then maybe you'll recognize this. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka purses his lips and attempts smooching sounds as he leans in to kiss Suki. His lips are suddenly grasped by a hand. The camera switches to the side-shot as Suki violently shoves him against the door. Frontal shot of Sokka as he makes contact with the door, his helm flinging off in the process. He looks bewildered to Suki. Cut to a close-up of Suki, her left arm still stretched out in the move she used to push him away. Her angry expression instantly brightens. \n",
      "SUKI: Sokka! [Runs up to him; cut to a side-view.] It's you! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Suki rushes to pull Sokka into an embrace. Still bewildered, he does not immediately return the gesture. Cut to a frontal shot of Sokka, Suki resting her head on his shoulder, and he mellows into the embrace, returning it in all honestly while closing his eyes. Cut to a close-up side-shot of Suki, who is tearing up out of joy. \n",
      "SOKKA: [They both stand up, not releasing each other.] The other Kyoshi Warriors, are they here? \n",
      "SUKI: No. I don't know where they are. They locked me in here because I'm the leader. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Places his right hand on her left cheek.] Well, you won't be here for long. I'm busting you out. \n",
      "SUKI: [Frontal shot.] I'm so glad [Places her hand over Sokka's on her face and closes her eyes.] to see you Sokka. [Opens them again.] I knew you'd come. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a side-shot of the now-reunited couple as they gaze lovingly at each other. They release hands, placing them on the other's arms, and lean in to kiss; Suki throws her arms around Sokka's neck. Cut to a close-up frontal shot of Zuko standing guard outside the cell. He suddenly looks to his right. Cut to a further off shot, showing the entire hallway, revealing that the sound that drew Zuko's attention was a guard ascending nearby stairs. He taps on the cell door to get Sokka and Suki's attention. Cut to inside the cell where the couple stops kissing, Sokka casting a suspicious look to the door. Cut back to outside the cell, where the female guard approaches Zuko, who is standing in front of the cell door, his arms crossed behind his back. He turns to her as she pulls up next to him. \n",
      "FEMALE.GUARD: Excuse me. [Cut to a shot from behind Zuko.] I need to get into that cell. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Shot from over the guard's shoulder.] No, you can't go in there! [Looks at the prison cell; unsure.] The lights are out. [Points at the door.] The prisoner could sneak up on you. \n",
      "FEMALE.GUARD: [Close-up. Cut to a side-shot; annoyed.] Step aside, fool. [She raises her left arm to push Zuko out of the way, though before she can touch him, he grabs hold of the arm and turns her around, slamming her face first against the door.] Hey, hey, what are you doing? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She turns to retaliate against Zuko's action. Cut to inside the cell, where Zuko's head can be seen through the looking hole as he is slammed against the door. The camera pans down to show Sokka and Suki pushed against the door, looking up in worry. Sokka's expression turns serious as he lowers his gaze and puts on his helmet. Cut to a close-up shot of the guard's right calf as Zuko plants his own leg behind it. Switch to a further off shot. Zuko grabs a hold of the woman's right arm and forces her to bend backward, thus averting her sight from the door that slides open. Sokka quickly exits the cell and shuffles away, his back pressed against the wall. The female guard manages to push Zuko's face up with her left arm, regaining a more leveled pose herself. Cut to a close-up side-shot of her from underneath Zuko's arms as she looks to her right. \n",
      "FEMALE.GUARD: [Instantly cut to a frontal shot of Sokka, who freezes over.] Guard, help! [He turns to look at the struggle.] I think he's an impostor! [Frontal shot of Sokka, looking unsure.] Arrest him! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a view of the gondola making its way to the prison. Cut back to inside the prison as the struggle continues. \n",
      "FEMALE.GUARD: Get him off me and arrest him! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Grabs Zuko and throws him down on the floor.] You're under arrest! [Whispering.] Don't worry, I'll figure it out. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka leads Zuko away, followed by the female guard. Later, Zuko, now in prison garb, is in an isolated room. The door opens, revealing the warden. \n",
      "WARDEN: Well, well, well. I never thought I'd find you in here, [Smiles evilly and walks into the cell.] Prince Zuko. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Shocked.] How did you know who I am? \n",
      "WARDEN: How could I not? You broke my niece's heart. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Even more shocked.] You're Mai's uncle? I never meant to hurt her. \n",
      "WARDEN: Quiet! You're my special prisoner now. And you'd best behave. If these criminals found out who you are, the traitor prince who let his nation down, why they'd tear you to shreds. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Folds his arms.] So what's in it for you? Why don't you just tell my father to come collect a reward? \n",
      "WARDEN: Oh, in due time, believe me, I intend to collect. [Walks away and shuts the door.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Outside the cells, Sokka comes down and sees Zuko and Suki mopping floors. \n",
      "SOKKA: Oh, good, you guys have met. \n",
      "SUKI: Actually, we met a long time ago. \n",
      "ZUKO: We did? \n",
      "SUKI: [Somewhat angrily.] Yeah, you kind of burned down my village. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Stops mopping for a second.] Oh, sorry about that. Nice to see you again. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko and Suki stop mopping and hide from the other guards beside a staircase. \n",
      "SOKKA: So, listen, I think I have an escape plan. I checked out the coolers again, and the point of them is to keep firebenders contained, right? \n",
      "ZUKO: Yeah ... \n",
      "SOKKA: So, they're completely insulated and sealed to keep the cold in. Well, to keep the cold in, it also has to keep the heat out, right? \n",
      "SUKI: Just get to the point, Sokka. \n",
      "SOKKA: It's a perfect boat for getting through the boiling water. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Exchanges a worried glance with Suki.] The cooler as a boat? Are you sure? \n",
      "SOKKA: I'm telling you, it'll work. [Flashes back to Sokka walking around the island; voice-over.] I walked around the perimeter. There's a blind spot between two guard towers. It's the perfect launching point. [Sokka puts a miniature boat in the water and watching it float away.] I already tested it out. We'll roll the cooler into the water and just float with the current. It'll take us straight across. As long as we don't make a sound, no one will notice. [Fade back to Sokka talking to Zuko and Suki.] And bing-bang-boom, we're home free. \n",
      "SUKI: But how are you going to get the cooler out? \n",
      "CHIT.SANG: [From the staircase.] Yeah, how are you going to get the cooler out? [Jumps down.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Covering up.] What? We didn't ... w-we didn't say that. \n",
      "ZUKO: Yeah, you heard wrong. \n",
      "CHIT.SANG: I heard you hatching an escape plan, and I want in. \n",
      "ZUKO: There's nothing to get in on. \n",
      "SOKKA: Yeah, the only thing we're hatching is ... an egg? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko lowers his head and Suki covers her eyes while they both sigh in annoyance. Cut back to Chit Sang. \n",
      "CHIT.SANG: [Unconvinced.] Okay, well, I come with you or the warden [Camera pans from a serious-looking Zuko to Suki.] hears about this egg, too. \n",
      "SUKI: [To Sokka.] I guess we have no choice. \n",
      "SOKKA: Okay, you're in. [Handing Zuko a wrench.] Now first we need someone to unbolt the cooler, from the inside. \n",
      "CHIT.SANG: Oh, I can get you inside. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a view of the stairs as two guards look down at the prison area. Chit Sang walks out from behind the stairs and stands in a spot. Zuko pretends to be mopping and bumps into Chit Sang. \n",
      "CHIT.SANG: Hey! What are you, stupid? Watch where you're going! [Shoves Zuko.] \n",
      "ZUKO: Hey, you watch who you're shoving! [He pushes Chit Sang.] \n",
      "CHIT.SANG: I think you mean whom I'm shoving! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two scuffle as the prisoners cheer them on. They break apart and Zuko goes for a punch. Chit Sang throws Zuko onto the floor. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Approaching. Yelling.] I need backup over here! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko dodges Chit Sang as he tries to elbow him. Zuko blasts fire at Chit Sang. \n",
      "MALE.GUARD: No firebending! [Pointing.] Into the cooler! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko is taken down and escorted away by two guards. Sokka looks at Suki, who is mopping and looks back, as he walks off. Later, Sokka opens the cooler. \n",
      "SOKKA: I can take you back to your cell if you've learned your lesson. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Raises his head slightly and releases a small breath of fire to warm himself up.] Yes, I have ... completely. [Reveals all the removed bolts and screws, which makes Sokka smile.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Lifts his visor; whispering.] I got Suki and Chit Sang out of their cells a few minutes ago. They'll be waiting for us at the shore. \n",
      "ZUKO: Someone's coming! [Takes Sokka into the cooler and closes the door.] \n",
      "MALE.GUARD: Yeah, new arrivals coming in at dawn. \n",
      "FEMALE.GUARD: Anybody interesting? \n",
      "MALE.GUARD: Nah, just the usual. Some robbers, a couple traitors, some war prisoners, [Sokka looks at Zuko with shock and worry.] though I did hear there might be a pirate. \n",
      "FEMALE.GUARD: No fooling! \n",
      "ZUKO: War prisoners. It could be your father. \n",
      "SOKKA: I know. \n",
      "ZUKO: Well, what should we do? Are we going ahead with the plan or are we waiting another night? \n",
      "SOKKA: I don't know! Is it right for me to risk Suki's freedom, all of our freedom on the slim chance that my dad is gonna show up? \n",
      "ZUKO: It's your call, Sokka. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to outside the prison, night time. Suki and Chit Sang are waiting for Sokka and Zuko until they hear them above, rolling the, now detached, cooler down the hill. Suki and Chit Sang move to help. \n",
      "CHIT.SANG: Took you guys long enough. [Cut briefly to two other prisoners, a male sitting on a rock, and a female waving.] This here's my girl and my best buddy, they're coming too. \n",
      "SOKKA: Fine. Everybody in the cooler. Let's go. [They move the cooler into the water. Cut to Sokka lifting a rock hiding his Water Tribe outfit.] \n",
      "ZUKO: Are you sure you wanna go? You're the one who said you wanted to redeem yourself. Redeem your honor. Rescuing your dad is your chance. \n",
      "SUKI: [Approaching.] Your dad? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Turns to Zuko.] If I had just cut my losses at the invasion, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess. Maybe sometimes it's just better to call it quits before you fail. \n",
      "ZUKO: No, it's not. Look Sokka, you're going to fail a lot before things work out. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Standing.] That supposed to make me feel better? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Sokka moves away.] Even though you'll probably fail over and over and over again ... \n",
      "SOKKA: Seriously, not helping. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Grabs Sokka's shoulder.] You have to try every time. You can't quit because you're afraid you might fail. \n",
      "CHIT.SANG: [Standing by the cooler boat.] Hey, if you two are done cuddling, can we get a move on? \n",
      "SOKKA: No. I'm staying. You guys go. [To Suki.] You've been here long enough. \n",
      "SUKI: I'm not leaving without you, Sokka. \n",
      "ZUKO: I'm staying, too. \n",
      "CHIT.SANG: Not me, I'm out. Let's roll, baby. [Pushes the cooler into the lake and jumps in.] \n",
      "SOKKA: We gave up our only chance of escaping. I hope we haven't just made a huge mistake. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As morning arrives, the cooler holding Chit Sang, his buddy, and his girlfriend is still within the perimeter of the prison. The current escapees are sweating as the cooler slowly floats with the current. \n",
      "CHIT.SANG: Aah, this current is so slow. I can use this to paddle. [Rips off a piece of the cooler. When he puts the piece of metal in the water, the steaming water splashes on to his hand, causing him to scream loudly.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A watchman catches notice. Two watchmen hit an alarm bell as the warden approaches. \n",
      "WARDEN: Guards! Secure the perimeter and lock down the prisoners! Now! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Many guards appear to lock down the prisoners as we see one guard use a fire whip to control the prisoners. Cut to the outside of the prison walls as the camera pans down to Sokka, Suki, and Zuko. \n",
      "SOKKA: The plan failed! They're caught! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut back to the warden near a launcher. \n",
      "WARDEN: Get the fugitives and throw them in the cooler! \n",
      "MALE.GUARD.#2: [The guard in charge of the steering wheel turns toward the warden.] Uh ... they are in a cooler, sir. \n",
      "WARDEN: One that's bolted down and not floating in the water! This is a lockdown! We have new prisoners arriving! Everything must be completely secure! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The male guard fires a large ballista bolt, catching hold of the cooler, and drags it back toward the prison. \n",
      "SOKKA: The gondola's moving. [Cut to a side-view of the gondola approaching the prison. Cut to a view of the prison yard as the gondola nears its stop. Cut to Sokka and Suki now in the yard.] This is it. [Cut to the gondola arriving. Cut to Sokka, Zuko and Suki in the yard.] If my dad's not there, we've risked everything for nothing. \n",
      "SUKI: We had to. [Holds Sokka's hand.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Come on, come on ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a large man with a tattoo and nose ring comes off the gondola first. \n",
      "ZUKO: Is that him? [Cut to Sokka.] \n",
      "SOKKA: My dad doesn't have a nose ring. [Cut briefly to the gondola as several men step off.] Where is he? [Cut to the gondola briefly as we see one more prisoner exit. Hakoda does not appear.] That's it? That can't be it. \n",
      "SUKI: [Comforting.] I'm sorry, Sokka. \n",
      "SOKKA: Oh, no. \n",
      "MALE.GUARD: Hey, you! Get off the gondola! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the gondola as Hakoda steps out. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Cut to Sokka, Shocked.] Dad ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to the words \"TO BE CONTINUED ...\" followed by the credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens to morning at the Boiling Rock, where an overhead shot of the volcano is seen. Cut to view from some point in the boiling water, where the stronghold lies ahead. Cut to view of the warden walking forward, toward the camera. \n",
      "BODYGUARD: Line 'em up for the warden! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to an overhead shot of the perimeter on which they are standing, the warden's back facing the camera. Eight prisoners are seen filing in line, one next to the other, including Hakoda. Cut to the end of the line of prisoners where the last of them line up, the camera zooming out to show Hakoda, who stands at the very end of the line on the right side. Cut to Sokka, who walks forward and lifts his guard mask. \n",
      "SOKKA: Dad ... [Exiting a stairway and passing through a lineup of guards, surprising them a bit.] Excuse me, coming through. The warden wants me over there. [Points in the warden's direction.] Sorry! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to overhead shot of the perimeter, the prisoners lined up toward the right and the guards to the left of the screen. Sokka is seen inching his way behind several guards, taller than him. The warden approaches the new prisoners. \n",
      "WARDEN: [Walking past the line of prisoners starting from the left.] Welcome to the Boiling Rock. I'm sure you've all heard the horrible rumors about our little island. Well, I just want to tell you that they don't have to be true, as long as you do everything I say. [He stops in front of Hakoda who looks downward; looks closer at Hakoda.] Look me in the eye when I'm talking to you. \n",
      "HAKODA: [Averting his gaze slightly off to the side; firmly.] No. \n",
      "WARDEN: Oh? You'd rather look at my shoes? [Angrily.] Then take a look! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He raises his left leg and drags Hakoda by his handcuffs down onto the floor. Cut to a side-view of Hakoda kneeling over, his face expressing anger. Cut to Sokka standing behind two guards as he gasps in horror. Cut to shot from below Hakoda, where the warden stands over him, keeping his foot firmly pressed on the warrior's handcuffs. \n",
      "WARDEN: I know exactly who you are, Hakoda of the Water Tribe. So strong-willed. [Cut to the warden's face.] But don't worry, we'll get rid of that in time. Now look me in the eye! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Hakoda reluctantly lifts his head to look the warden in the eye and glares hatefully at him. \n",
      "WARDEN: [Calmer.] See, isn't that better? [To the other prisoners.] You will all do as I say or pay the price. You will all- \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He begins to walk forward only for Hakoda to lift his left handcuff slightly, tripping the warden and causing him to fall flat on the ground. Sokka stifles a chuckle, as the two guards he was standing behind rush to aid the warden. \n",
      "BOGYGUARD.#2: [Standing over him.] Are you okay, sir? \n",
      "WARDEN: [Rises and snaps angrily.] I'm fine! Get these prisoners out of my sight! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He storms away impatiently. The two guards look at each other. Cut to wide-view of the perimeter where the prisoners file one behind the other and are led down a stairwell into what is presumed to be the prison hold. Sokka runs away off-screen. Cut to inside the prison, followed by an overhead shot of inside Hakoda's cell, where he sits on his mattress, his face buried in his arms.

Cut to side-view of the entire cell, revealing that Sokka has walked in, still dressed as a guard. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Approaches his father.] Thank goodness you're okay. \n",
      "HAKODA: [Rises to his feet and extends his right arm out, clenched in a fist, not realizing the guard is his son in disguise; Sokka backs up a bit.] If you take one step closer, you'll see just how \"okay\" I am. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Lifting up his helmet mask.] Dad, it's me. \n",
      "HAKODA: [Softens up and grows teary-eyed.] Sokka, [The two embrace; Sokka drops his helmet to the floor.] my son. [Amused.] You know Sokka, you should be more careful with that guard outfit on. I almost punched you in the gut. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Rubs the back of his neck sheepishly.] Yeah, I ran into that problem earlier. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to a dimly-lit corridor. Cut to view of a door as it slides open, revealing Chit Sang sitting inside an interrogation room, cuffed to a wooden chair. The warden walks on-screen into the room. Cut to an overhead shot of the interrogation room as he approaches the prisoner. \n",
      "WARDEN: [Calmly.] Are you comfortable, Chit Sang? \n",

      "WARDEN: Are you still comfortable? \n",
      "CHIT.SANG: No. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The warden exits the room. Cut to view of the room, as the two guards hoist the chair upward and set it on the ground.

      "SOKKA: [To Hakoda.] So where's Bato? [Cut to inside the prison cell; Sokka turns away from the door.] Where's everyone else from the invasion? \n",
      "HAKODA: The others are being held at a prison near the Fire Nation palace. They singled me out as their leader and sent me here. [Sokka comes by his father and sits down.] But before I left, I met some young women who said they knew you. The ... Oshinama Fighters? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Smiles.] You mean the Kyoshi Warriors? \n",

      "SOKKA: And you know Prince Zuko? \n",
      "HAKODA: The son of the Fire Lord? I don't know him, but I know of him. \n",
      "SOKKA: Well, he's here too. \n",
      "HAKODA: [Crosses his arms angrily.] Sounds like a major problem. \n",
      "SOKKA: Actually, he's on our side now. [Cut to Hakoda, who gives his son a suspicious look.] I know. I had the same reaction. After all he's done, it was hard to trust him. But he's really proven himself, and I never would've found you without his help. [Hakoda nods his head at Sokka, indicating that he understands.] \n",
      "HAKODA: So, do you have a plan? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Downcast.] We had one, but some of the other prisoners got involved and ruined it. [Leans forward and rests his face in his arms.] I dunno if there's another way off this island. \n",
      "HAKODA: [Smiles and pats a hand on Sokka's back.] Sokka, there's no prison in the world that can hold two Water Tribe geniuses. \n",
      "SOKKA: Then we'd better find two. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Hakoda laughs. Sokka chuckles nervously. Cut to a ground level shot of inside the prison hold. Sokka approaches a cell door and averts his gaze alertly. He lifts his helmet mask and peers into the slit of a cell doorway. \n",

      "SOKKA: [Puzzled.] Why? \n",
      "FEMALE.GUARD: [Irritated.] Because we have orders straight from the warden, that's why! \n",

      "FEMALE.GUARD: Fine, ten seconds. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A sliver of light appears as the cell door is opened. Sokka suddenly grabs Zuko and begins to wrestle him to look convincing as the two guards enter. \n",

      "MAI: Come on, [Zuko looks to the source of the voice.] Zuko. [Emerges from the corner of the room; annoyed.] We all know that's a lie. \n",

      "WARDEN: How is he? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to right-side up shot of the two guards holding Chit Sang upside-down in the chair. Chit Sang's face is red and strained. \n",
      "BODYGUARD.#2: I think he's ready to talk. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They toss chair the chair forward toward the warden back to a normal position. Chit Sang inhales deeply a few times, his face slowly returning to normal color, sweat dripping down his face. \n",
      "WARDEN: [Approaches him from behind.] Have you had enough time to think about what I asked? \n",
      "CHIT.SANG: Yes. \n",
      "WARDEN: [Eager.] And? \n",
      "CHIT.SANG: You're right. There was another person involved in the escape plan. \n",
      "WARDEN: [Places his hand on Chit Sang's shoulder.] Who? \n",
      "CHIT.SANG: It's a guy who's disguised like a prison guard. Only he's not a prison guard. He's the mastermind. He came up with the plan. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The warden smiles slyly, pats Chit Sang on the head, and exits. The camera focuses on Chit Sang, who maintains a cold-hard expression. The scene changes to the prison cell where Zuko sits in the chair slumped over and Mai stands over him. \n",
      "ZUKO: How did you know I was here? \n",
      "MAI: Because I know you so well. \n",
      "ZUKO: But, how- \n",
      "MAI: The warden's my uncle, you idiot. [Zuko sighs; Mai shows him a letter.] The truth is, I guess I don't know you. All I get is a letter? You could have least looked me in the eye when you ripped out my heart. \n",
      "ZUKO: I didn't mean to - \n",
      "MAI: You didn't mean to? [Reading the letter.] \"Dear Mai, I'm sorry you that you have to find out this way, but I'm leaving.\" \n",
      "ZUKO: Stop! This isn't about you. This is about the Fire Nation! \n",
      "MAI: [Sarcastically.] Thanks Zuko, that makes me feel all better. [Throws the letter at him.] \n",
      "ZUKO: [Stands up.] Mai, I never wanted to hurt you. But I have to do this to save my country. \n",
      "MAI: Save it? You're betraying your country! \n",
      "ZUKO: That's not how I see it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut back to Mai who looks away from him sulkily and folds her arms. Cut to Suki's cell, where she is practicing her fighting moves. Sokka enters. \n",
      "SUKI: Sokka, what's going on? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Places his hand on her shoulder.] I don't have much time. If I'm seen with you the guards might think something's up. [Walks over to the door and peers outside.] I just talked to my dad. \n",
      "SUKI: That's great. \n",
      "SOKKA: Yeah, and we're escaping today, on the gondola. \n",
      "SUKI: What? \n",
      "SOKKA: My dad and I came up with the plan together. We're gonna commandeer the gondola [Puts both hands on her shoulders.] and we're gonna take a hostage with us so they won't cut the lines. \n",
      "SUKI: [Takes his hands off her shoulders.] We'll never make it onto the gondola. There's too many guards. \n",
      "SOKKA: My dad already thought of that. He said we'll need a distraction. That's why we're gonna start a prison riot. \n",
      "SUKI: Okay, let's say by some miracle this all works and we make it on the gondola. The warden will still just cut the lines, even if we have a captive. \n",
      "SOKKA: Not if the warden is the captive. [Nearby noise occurs. Moves to look outside.] I have to go. [Suki hugs him.] I'll find you before we start the riot. [Cut to outside the cell, where he slides out of the cell.] \n",
      "MALE.GUARD: Hey, you, the warden wants to see you! \n",
      "SOKKA: Why? \n",
      "MALE.GUARD: I don't know, I didn't ask. \n",
      "SOKKA: Maybe I could schedule another time with him? How's tomorrow? [Walks off-screen.] \n",
      "MALE.GUARD: He wants to see you ... now. [Sokka is escorted by two guards.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Scene moves to the yard with a line-up of guards, the warden, and Chit Sang present. \n",
      "WARDEN: Put him in the line-up. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They throw Sokka in the line-up with a bunch of other guards, now with no helmet like the rest of them. He tries hiding behind a lowly guard, but the guard pushes him away. \n",
      "WARDEN: One of you is an impostor who thought he could fool me. [Chit Sang steps forward.] But now, that person is going to be in a lot of trouble. Who is it? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka's teeth start chattering, clearly nervous among the other calm guards. The camera stays on Sokka, who closes his eyes. \n",
      "CHIT.SANG: [Off-screen.] That's him, warden. He's the impostor! [The camera shifts to Chit Sang, who is pointing at the bully guard.] \n",
      "BULLY.GUARD: What? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the warden, who smiles evilly and walks away. \n",
      "BULLY.GUARD: [Grabs Chit Sang by the shirt.] I am not! [Chit Sang just raises his hands nonchalantly in defense.] He's lying! [Another guard grabs him.] He's a liar! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The guard is taken away. Chit Sang turns and smiles slyly at Sokka, who looks on and breathes a sigh of relief.\n",
      "Cut to a window. The camera pans down to the bully guard in an interrogation room surrounded by two guards. The warden stands in front of and away Chit Sang, holding his hands behind his back. \n",
      "BULLY.GUARD: I'm telling you ... it wasn't me! \n",
      "WARDEN: Save your breath! I know you were working together. [Turns around and moves in closer to the guard.] You threw Chit Sang in the very cooler they used to escape. It was all part of your plan. \n",
      "BULLY.GUARD: That was just a coincidence! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The door opens, someone enters. \n",
      "BODYGUARD.#2: Sir, there's someone to see you. \n",
      "WARDEN: [Angrily.] Who told you to interrupt me? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The warden turns angrily toward the door, but looks shocked and bows upon seeing who it is. Cut to show Azula standing at the door with Ty Lee behind her. All of the guards bow to her as well. \n",
      "AZULA: I did. \n",
      "WARDEN: [Cut closer to Azula.] Princess Azula. [Azula and Ty Lee walk in.] Ah ... It is an honor to welcome you to the Fire Nation's most exemplary prison. [Stands up.] I didn't realize you were coming. \n",
      "AZULA: [Walks in and notices the guard sitting in the chair.] Who is this? \n",
      "WARDEN: [Cut to the bully guard, who looks away.] He's a guard who was involved in a recent and feeble escape attempt. \n",
      "BULLY.GUARD: [Desperately.] It wasn't me! \n",
      "WARDEN: [Angrily.] Quiet, you! \n",
      "AZULA: [Crossing her arms.] You're wasting your time. That's not one of them. [Turns and starts to leave.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The warden turns and looking surprised, and confused, looks from Azula to the guard before looking back to Azula again. \n",
      "WARDEN: How do you know? \n",
      "AZULA: [Smiles sinisterly; quietly.] Because I'm a people person. [Exits.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: In the hall, Sokka approaches a guard in charge of the cell doors. \n",
      "SOKKA: Hey, I just got orders. Let the prisoners out into the yard. \n",
      "DOOR.GUARD: But we're in the middle of a lockdown. \n",
      "SOKKA: Oh, okay, I'll just go tell the warden you said that. [Walks off-screen; the guard raises his mask and looks at him speechless.] I'm sure he'll be glad to hear about you undermining his authority. [Guard grows more nervous. Walks back on-screen, lifting his helmet mask.] What's your name again? \n",
      "DOOR.GUARD: [Starts to sweat; horrified.] Wait! Don't tell the warden. I'm just a little confused. \n",
      "SOKKA: Hey, I'm confused too, but the warden's in a bad mood, and ... irrational, so if you ask me, it's best not to question it, and just do what he says. [Places his arm around the guard's shoulder.] \n",
      "DOOR.GUARD: Yeah ... you're right. We're letting them out! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The guard opens all the doors by pulling the levers. The prisoners head for the yard. The prisoners mingle in the yard, where Sokka, Suki, and Hakoda meet. \n",
      "SOKKA: This is it! We have to start a riot. \n",
      "SUKI: Okay. But how do we do that? \n",
      "HAKODA: [Smiles smugly.] I'll show you. [Shoves a prisoner.] \n",
      "TOUGH.PRISONER: Hey! What'd you do that for? That hurt my feelings. \n",
      "HAKODA: Aren't you mad at me? \n",
      "TOUGH.PRISONER: Uh, well, normally I would be, but I've been learning to control my anger. \n",
      "SOKKA: This isn't working. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Suddenly, Chit Sang appears behind Sokka and puts his hand on Sokka's shoulder. \n",
      "CHIT.SANG: Hey you! You're lucky I didn't rat you out, [Smiles.] but my generosity comes with a price. I know you're planning another escape attempt, and I want in. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Gets an idea.] Actually, we're trying to escape right now, but we need a riot. [Points to him.] You wouldn't happen to know how to start one, would you? \n",
      "CHIT.SANG: A prison riot? Please. [Grabs a prisoner and lifts him in the air, bouncing him up and down.] Hey! [All the prisoners look at him.] Riot! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The riot begins. Several blasts of fire go off. \n",
      "HAKODA: [Looks shocked for a moment.] Impressive. \n",
      "TOUGH.PRISONER: Forget about controlling my anger ... [Raises his arms.] let's riot! [He is taken down by another prisoner. The riot is in full swing. Cut the floor of the yard as chaos and dust ensues everywhere. Cut to a prisoner sitting on another prisoner's shoulders, attempting to choke him. Cut to the bottom of a tower as various guards look down at the scene.] \n",
      "WARDEN: Who let these prisoners into the yard? [Cut to the warden on a balcony.] This is supposed to be a lockdown! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The door guard, who was in charge of the control room, raises his visor and looks at the warden, horrified. He puts his back against the wall and sneaks away by quickly tip-toeing and ducks to a corner. The camera cuts back to Zuko and Mai. \n",
      "MALE.GUARD.#2: Ma'am, there's a riot going on! I'm here to protect you! \n",
      "MAI: I don't need any protection. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Gives a slight chuckle; proudly.] Believe me, she doesn't. \n",
      "MALE.GUARD.#2: I'm sorry, but I'm under direct orders from your uncle to make sure nothing happens. [Zuko gives a serious look.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko blasts fire at the guard and starts to run toward the door. The guard jumps in front of Mai to shield her. \n",
      "MAI: Get off of me! [She throws the guard away from her and chases Zuko.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Exiting, Zuko closes and locks the door, trapping Mai and the guard in the room. He looks at Mai through the slit in the door with regret, while she stares back in anger, before running off to join his friends. Back in the yard, he reaches everyone else and slams down another guard as the riot continues. \n",
      "SOKKA: Zuko! Good, we're all here. Now all we need to do is grab the warden, and get to the gondolas! \n",
      "ZUKO: And how do we do that? \n",
      "SOKKA: I'm not sure. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Groans.] I thought you thought this through! \n",
      "SOKKA: I thought you told me it's okay not to think everything through! \n",
      "ZUKO: Maybe not everything, but this is kind of important! [Rubs his forehead.] \n",
      "CHIT.SANG: Hey, uh, fellas. I think your girlfriend's taking care of it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka peeks out and looks amazed as he sees Suki hop up on the heads of the rioters before jumping and flipping onto the tower. She easily defeats the first guard with a few quick jabs. Two more guards arrive. She ducks a fire blast and sweeps the first one, promptly dodges the second one's fire blast, and continues to climb the tower. She makes it up to the top and defeats the final guard with a sliding kick. She soon grabs the warden, threatening him with her fist in front of his face. \n",
      "WARDEN: You wouldn't dare. \n",
      "SUKI: [Ties his hands together and uses his headband as a gag.] Sorry, warden. You're my prisoner now. [Slams the warden against the wall; the rest of the escapees arrive.] We've got the warden! Now let's get out of here! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Everyone else is out of breath. \n",
      "HAKODA: That's some girl. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Proudly.] Tell me about it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the roof as they all make the run to the gondola. \n",
      "SUKI: We're almost there! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They are stopped by guards who launch two fire blasts at them. Zuko shoves Sokka out of the way and blocks the two fire blasts. More guards appear to help. \n",
      "ZUKO: Back off! We've got the warden! [The guards see the warden on Chit Sang's shoulder, bound and gagged, and clear the way.] Let's go! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They continue along their path, cautiously watching the guards so they do not try any sudden moves. They arrive at the gondola. Suki opens the door. \n",
      "SUKI: Everyone in! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko starts the gondola and kicks the handle a few times attempting to break it. He sees the guards rushing toward him and kicks the handle again and breaks it. He jumps toward the gondola while dodging guards fire blasts. Sokka grabs Zuko's hand and helps him into the gondola. \n",
      "SOKKA: What are you doing? \n",
      "ZUKO: I'm making it so they can't stop us. \n",
      "SOKKA: Way to think ahead. \n",
      "SUKI: We're on our way! \n",
      "HAKODA: Wait! Who's that? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Azula and Ty Lee stand at the bottom of the gondola station. All the guards bow down. \n",
      "ZUKO: That's a problem. It's my sister and her friend. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Looking up at the retreating gondola, Azula suddenly snatches a pair of handcuffs from a guard's belt and runs forward. Behind her, Ty Lee jumps up and onto the cable, running along it toward the gondola. After elevating herself to the line with a fire blast, Azula uses the cuffs to attach herself to the cable and propel herself forwaard. The occupants of the gondola watch as they approach, Suki looking very grim. \n",
      "SUKI: [Determined.] This is a rematch I've been waiting for. \n",
      "ZUKO: Me too. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka, Suki, and Zuko climb to the top of the gondola to meet Azula and Ty Lee. Ty Lee flips into the air and lands in front of Suki, who growls and assumes a battle-ready position. Azula pulls herself up onto the roof and faces Zuko and Sokka. An overhead shot shows them all standing atop the gondola before closing in on Azula again. The Fire Nation princess assumes a battle stance and performs a slicing kick, sending blue fire at her opponents, but Zuko blocks it. Ty Lee and Suki trade blows, the latter blocking the former's attempts to use chi blocking each time. Ty Lee is forced to the edge but jumps into the gondola and comes out the other side, continuing her attacks. Zuko continues to wipe out Azula's fire blasts. Sokka draws her back to the edge with his sword. Zuko goes in for a finish, but Azula dodges Zuko's blast and stays on the gondola. She counters with a blast that goes wide, almost striking Suki and Ty Lee, who barely manage to dodge it. Meanwhile, the warden attempts to free himself while the other prisoners are distracted. A male guard watches from a telescope. \n",
      "GONDOLA.GUARD: There's the warden! I see him! \n",
      "WARDEN: [Frees himself and runs to look out of the gondola.] Cut the line! [Chit Sang notices and grabs the warden.] \n",
      "GONDOLA.GUARD: He wants us to cut the line. \n",
      "GONDOLA.GUARD.#2: But if we cut the line, there's no way he'll survive! \n",
      "GONDOLA.GUARD: [Puts down his telescope.] He knows that. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The guards stop the gondola by jamming the mechanism with metal bars; the wheel screeches angrily as it grinds to a halt. The gondola rocks back and forth from the sudden stop, disrupting the combatants from their respective duels. Losing his balance, Sokka slides to the edge of the gondola, but Zuko pulls him in at the last moment. Ty Lee jumps up to the top of the wire to see what is happening. \n",
      "TY.LEE: They're about to cut the line! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The guards work to cut the line. Azula notices another gondola approaching on the other wire, heading inbound. \n",
      "AZULA: [Smirks.] Then it's time to leave. [Blasts herself up.] Goodbye, Zuko. [Reaches the other gondola.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Ty Lee backflips to the other gondola. When she reaches it, she looks back at Sokka, Suki, and Zuko with concern, in contrast to Azula's sadistic smile. The other three jump back into the gondola. \n",
      "ZUKO: They're cutting the line! The gondola's about to go! \n",
      "HAKODA: I hope this thing floats. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Pan down to the Boiling Lake. The line is almost entirely severed by now, but before the guards can finish the job, they are suddenly yanked away from it and pinned to the wall by stilettos. \n",
      "GONDOLA.GUARD.#3: What are you doing? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera cuts to show Mai standing near the line. \n",
      "MAI: Saving the jerk who dumped me. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Other guards try to attack Mai, but she dodges all their fire blasts and retaliates with her knives, pinning them all down by their wristguards. Mai rears up in front of a female guard, who stops in fear, and deploys four knives that send the two guards behind her flying, dislodging one of the bars jamming the wheel mechanism. She pulls out her three-pronged sai and pins down the last guard. Releasing the block on the line, she allows the gondola to continue in motion. Everyone looks back to see what happened. \n",
      "SOKKA: Who's that? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Mai continues to fight off guards and turns her head to see the others. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Shocked.] It's Mai! \n",
      "AZULA: [Angrily.] What is she doing? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Ty Lee shrugs and makes a small sound as they watch her continue to fight off guards, all of whom are helpless against her. The gondola makes it to the top of the hill. Everyone leaves. Chit Sang holds the warden and throws him back in when Hakoda points at it. \n",
      "HAKODA: Sorry, warden. Your record is officially broken. [The warden struggles against his bindings.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the others escaping over the rim of the volcano. \n",
      "SUKI: Well, we made it out. Now what? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka turns and notices Zuko standing still. \n",
      "SOKKA: Zuko, what are you doing? \n",
      "ZUKO: My sister was on that island. \n",
      "SOKKA: Yeah, and she's probably right behind us, so let's not stop! \n",
      "ZUKO: What I mean is she must have come here somehow. [Walks up to a large hill by the sea.] There! [Pan down to a large airship.] That's our way out of here! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Back at the prison. Mai is detained by two guards, while Azula glares at her. Ty Lee stands in the middle, looking terrified and concerned at the two. \n",
      "AZULA: Leave us alone. [The guards give the Fire Nation salute and exit. Mai raises her head a little, looking defiant.] I never expected this from you. [Cut to a side view of Mai, followed by a frontal shot of Ty Lee, who looks from one to the other, tears in her eyes, and back to Azula.] The thing I don't understand is \"Why?\". Why would you do it? You know the consequences. \n",
      "MAI: I guess you just don't know people as well as you think you do. You miscalculated. I love Zuko more than I fear you. \n",
      "AZULA: [Her intrigued expression contorts into one of absolute rage.] No, you miscalculated! You should have feared me more! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Azula angles her fingers to create lightning, and Mai readies one of her stilettos, her eyes narrowed. Before Azula can complete her attack, however, she is struck twice by Ty Lee, who chi blocks her. Cuts to Mai, blade still in hand and looking very surprised, and to Azula, who dumbfoundedly falls to the ground, paralyzed. Ty Lee seems surprised at her own actions. \n",
      "TY.LEE: [Runs to a shocked Mai, shaking her from her stupor.] Come on! Let's get out of here! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Mai and Ty Lee are quickly surrounded by guards and captured before they can escape. \n",
      "AZULA: [Still on the ground; angrily.] You're both fools! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Azula is helped up by two guards. Mai and Ty Lee are both restrained, looking defiantly at the princess. \n",
      "GONDOLA.GUARD.#4: What shall we do with them, princess? \n",
      "AZULA: Put them somewhere I'll never have to see their faces again, and let them rot! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Nightfall, Western Air Temple. The ship is returned. Zuko and Sokka exit, standing in front of Toph, Aang, and Katara. \n",
      "KATARA: What are you doing in this thing? What happened to the war balloon? \n",

      "SOKKA: We kind of went to a Fire Nation prison. \n",

      "TOPH: Seriously? You guys didn't find any meat? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens to morning at the Western Air Temple. Cuts to overhead shot of the team's campsite, the camera panning downward slightly, showing their sleeping bags all arranged in a circular form. Cuts to overhead shot of Suki and Chit Sang sleeping, Chit Sang snoring. The camera pans to the right to reveal Hakoda asleep next to Chit Sang. Cuts to ground-level shot of Teo asleep, The Duke and Zuko in the background also in a slumber.\n",
      "Cuts to shot of Aang asleep on Appa as he wakes up, yawning and rubs his eyes. Cuts to shot of the nearby fountain from the view of their campsite, several birds fluttering about. The birds suddenly fly away as a bomb is launched their way, splashing through the waterfall fountain. Cuts to Aang, who grows suddenly alert, before switching to shot of Appa as the Avatar rises and uses his glider to airbend the bomb away. Cuts to overhead shot of the temple as the bomb explodes. Two more bombs pelt the building. Cuts to campsite, where everyone is now fully awake.\n",
      "Cuts to shot of Aang, his back to the camera, as he races toward the edge of the building, glider in hand. The camera zooms in past his figure to a shot of a Fire Nation airship coming into view. Cuts to side-view of the bow of the airship, which launches another bomb that sails through the air and crashes into a nearby bridge. Cuts to Aang, who runs back to the campsite, Appa following close behind, and uses airbending to force the large, ceiling-high metal doors surrounding their site to close. Several bombs continue to assail the temple. Cuts to shot of a portion of the ceiling roof, as it begins to crumble and finally caves in. Cuts to overhead shot of Katara standing directly beneath the crumbling ceiling. She looks up, alarmed, only to be pushed out of the way by Zuko. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang, Katara, and Sokka begin pulling on the reins together in an attempt to budge Appa. Cuts to shot of the doors of the building, which continue to be destroyed. Debris continues to fall to the ground as Zuko races toward the doors and leaps over to the other side just as another piece of the door falls and shatters. Cuts to shot of Zuko running toward the airships. One bomb is launched and lands several feet before him where it detonates. Thick gray plumes of smoke rise; after a brief moment, Zuko emerges from the smoke cover, unharmed.\n",
      "He firebends a large blast from his hand. Cuts to shot of an airship, as it receives the blow. Cuts to shot of Zuko standing near the edge of the temple, looking at the airships. A podium-like devise suddenly rises; standing atop it is Azula. Cuts to shot of the princess, who has an evil, maniacal grin on her face. \n",
      "ZUKO: What are you doing here? \n",
      "AZULA: [Smiling.] You mean it's not obvious yet? I am about to celebrate becoming an only child! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Azula kicks a large blast of flame at her brother. Zuko dodges and runs backward into the temple, but falls. Several blasts are sent his way as the temple begins to fall apart. He runs toward the airships. As he jumps toward the ship, he sends several shots toward Azula, but fails to hit her and jumps onto the airship. He falls down into the misty floor below.\n",
      "Aang and the group are seen trying to get Appa into the tunnel unsuccessfully. \n",
      "AANG: I can't get him to go in there! Appa hates tunnels! \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, there's no way we can fly out of here. \n",
      "AANG: We'll have to find a way! \n",
      "SOKKA: We need to split up. [To the others.] Take the tunnel and get to the stolen airship. \n",
      "KATARA: [Turns around and suddenly grows angry.] No! [Walks up to her father.] The Fire Nation can't separate our family again! \n",
      "HAKODA: It'll be okay. It's not forever. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara hesitates before hugging her dad and running back to Aang. Sokka and Hakoda hug also as Sokka takes Suki and runs with the others. The two groups go their separate ways. Toph is seen touching a wall. \n",
      "TOPH: I can clear that away and we can fly out through there! \n",
      "SUKI: Um, there's an awful lot of fire in that general direction ... \n",
      "AANG: We'll get through. Let's go. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa flies through to the outside of the temple, covered by a shield of rock in front. Azula tries to bring him down, only for the shield to absorb the blasts. Appa escapes and the shield disintegrates. Behind Azula, a second airship rises, revealing Zuko survived his fall by getting onto another airship.\n",
      "Zuko and Azula face off. Zuko makes the first move. He jumps toward Azula, who sends columns of fire at him, which he responds to with more blasts. The two attack each other several times.\n",
      "Scene changes to Appa, dodging fire blasts, as Katara deflects several large whips of fire with her waterbending. The group rises above the airship to avoid more fire.\n",
      "Back on the airship. Azula and Zuko are evenly matched until they both hit each other with fire-packed punches, launching them both off the airship. Zuko is caught by Katara, but Azula is left falling. \n",
      "ZUKO: She's ... not gonna make it ... [Azula uses her firebending to propel herself toward the wall, stopping her fall with her hair pin and saving herself.] Of course she did. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of Azula, who stands on the side of the cliff, smiling evilly. Cuts to shot of her watching as the team escapes, her back to the camera. The scene switches to where the gang is camping outside. \n",
      "AANG: Wow, camping ... it really seems like old times again, doesn't it? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Jokingly.] If you really want it to feel like old times, I could, uh ... chase you around a while and try to capture you. [He smiles and the rest of the group laughs, except for Katara.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Sarcastically.] Ha, ha. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Holding up his cup.] To Zuko! Who knew after all those times he tried to snuff us out, today he'd be our hero? \n",
      "TEAM.AVATAR: [Everybody except Katara holds up their cups.] Hear! Hear! [Aang nudges him with his elbow, before Toph lightly punches him.] \n",
      "ZUKO: [Smiling.] I'm touched. [Stops smiling.] I don't deserve this. \n",
      "KATARA: [Angrily.] Yeah, no kidding. [Walks away.] \n",
      "SOKKA: What's with her? \n",
      "ZUKO: I wish I knew. [Follows her.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of the entire campsite. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Voice-over.] What's with him? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of a waxing gibbous moon, partially obscured by the clouds. Cuts to a shot of Katara sitting on a rock and overlooking a rocky cliff, Zuko approaching her from behind. She catches sight of him, immediately grows antagonistic, and rises to walk farther away toward the cliff. \n",
      "ZUKO: This isn't fair! Everyone else seems to trust me now! What is it with you? \n",
      "KATARA: [Turns around; furiously.] Oh, everyone trusts you now! I was the first person to trust you! [Places her left hand on her heart.] Remember, back in Ba Sing Se. [Points to the ocean.] And you turned around and betrayed me, betrayed all of us! \n",
      "ZUKO: [Closes eyes in resentment.] What can I do to make it up to you? \n",
      "KATARA: [Cuts to shot of her and Zuko standing on the cliff as she approaches him while snapping at him angrily.] You really want to know? Hmm, maybe you could reconquer Ba Sing Se in the name of the Earth King. [Cuts to side-view of her and Zuko.] Or, I know! You could bring my mother back! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara storms away, slightly hitting his left shoulder with her right one as she passes Zuko, leaving him disappointed. Cuts to shot of entire cliff side, the waves crashing against the rocky wall. The scene switches to the campsite where Zuko accidentally runs into Suki on his way to confront Sokka. \n",
      "SUKI: [Embarrassed.] Oops, wrong tent! \n",
      "ZUKO: Sorry, do you need to talk to Sokka, too? \n",
      "SUKI: Nope, not me! [Walks away.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko enters the tent, a look of disbelief spreading across his face. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Holding a rose in his mouth, surrounded by lit candles.] Well, hello ... [Surprised to find Zuko in his tent, destroying the rose in his mouth.] Uh, Zuko! Yes, why would I be expecting anyone different? [Painfully swallows rose petals and thorns.] So what's on your mind? \n",
      "ZUKO: Your sister. She hates me! And I don't know why, but I do care what she thinks of me. \n",
      "SOKKA: Nah, she doesn't hate you. Katara doesn't hate anyone. Except maybe some people in the Fire Nation. [His eyes widen as he realizes his mistake.] No, I mean, uh, not people who are good, but used to be bad. I mean, bad people. Fire Nation people who are still bad, who've never been good and probably won't be, ever! \n",
      "ZUKO: [Interrupting him.] Stop. Okay, listen. I know this may seem out of nowhere, but I want you to tell me what happened to your mother. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Slightly taken aback.] What? Why would you want to know that? \n",
      "ZUKO: Katara mentioned it before when we were imprisoned together in Ba Sing Se, and again just now when she was yelling at me. I think somehow she's connected her anger at that to her anger at me. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sadly.] It's not a day I like to remember. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A flashback is shown of a younger Katara having a snowball fight with her brother. Sokka peers over a snow wall and prepares to throw a snowball at his sister only to be hit by a snowball thrown by a younger Katara, off-screen. Cuts to shot of Katara, who giggles joyfully. Cuts to shot of Sokka, who climbs over the snow wall, carrying an exceptionally large snowball. He drops it, however, upon witnessing blackened snow falling from the sky. \n",
      "YOUNG.KATARA: I'm going to find Mom! [Runs off.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Voice-over.] Many of the warriors had seen the black snow before and they knew what it meant: a Fire Nation raid. [A battle scene is depicted of Water Tribe Warriors and Fire Nation soldiers charging and attacking one another.] We were badly outnumbered, but somehow, we managed to drive them off. As quickly as they came, they just left. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cuts to shot of Sokka tossing his boomerang toward the retreating soldiers. The scene switches back to present day. \n",
      "SOKKA: I was so relieved when it was over, but that's because I didn't know yet what had happened. I didn't know we had lost our mother. \n",
      "ZUKO: Wait. Can you remember any details about the soldiers who raided your village? Like what the lead ship looked like? \n",
      "SOKKA: Yeah ... sea ravens. [Scene shows flashback of three red flags waving in the breeze, bearing sea ravens.] The main ship had flags with sea ravens on them. \n",
      "ZUKO: The symbol of the Southern Raiders. Thanks, Sokka. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Urging Zuko hurriedly out of the tent.] No problem. Thanks for stopping by! [Zuko leaves.] I'd thought he'd never leave. [Peaks head out excitedly and whispers.] Suki! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Unfortunately for him, Zuko has barely taken two steps away from the tent and is looking curiously at Sokka. Sokka pretends to be completely oblivious and whistles. The next day, Katara emerges from her tent to find Zuko waiting outside, sitting on a rock. \n",
      "KATARA: [Angrily.] You look terrible. \n",
      "ZUKO: I waited out here all night. \n",
      "KATARA: [Brushing her hair.] What do you want? \n",
      "ZUKO: I know who killed your mother, [She abruptly stops.] and I'm going to help you find him. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara casts him a look of shock, which soon turns to a look of anger.\n",
      "The scene changes to later in the day where Aang is feeding Appa hay. Sokka fiddles around with a flower necklace. Katara and Zuko approach the bison, Zuko carrying a sack slung over his shoulder. \n",
      "KATARA: I need to borrow Appa. \n",
      "AANG: [Jokingly.] Why? Is it your turn to take a little field trip with Zuko? \n",
      "KATARA: Yes, it is. \n",
      "AANG: [Slightly surprised.] Oh. What's going on? \n",
      "KATARA: We're going to find the man who took my mother from me. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka pauses and stands up, surprised. \n",
      "ZUKO: Sokka told me the story of what happened. I know who did it and I know how to find him. \n",
      "AANG: Um ... and what exactly do you think this will accomplish? \n",
      "KATARA: [Shakes her head in dismay.] Ugh, I knew you wouldn't understand. [Begins to walk away.] \n",
      "AANG: Wait! Stop! I do understand. You're feeling unbelievable pain and rage. How do think I felt about the sandbenders when they stole Appa? How do you think I felt about the Fire Nation when I found out what happened to my people? \n",
      "ZUKO: She needs this, Aang. This is about getting closure and justice. \n",
      "AANG: I don't think so. I think it's about getting revenge. \n",
      "KATARA: [Angrily.] Fine, maybe it is! Maybe that's what I need! Maybe that's what he deserves! \n",
      "AANG: Katara, you sound like Jet. \n",
      "KATARA: It's not the same! Jet attacked the innocent. This man, he's a monster. \n",
      "SOKKA: Katara, she was my mother, too, but I think Aang might be right. \n",
      "KATARA: Then you didn't love her the way I did! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Hurt.] Katara! \n",
      "AANG: The monks used to say that revenge is like a two-headed rat viper. While you watch your enemy go down, you're being poisoned yourself. \n",
      "ZUKO: That's cute, but this isn't air temple preschool. It's the real world. \n",
      "KATARA: Now that I know he's out there ... now that I know we can find him, I feel like I have no choice. \n",
      "AANG: Katara, you do have a choice: forgiveness. \n",
      "ZUKO: That's the same as doing nothing! \n",
      "AANG: No, it's not. It's easy to do nothing, but it's hard to forgive. \n",
      "KATARA: It's not just hard, it's impossible. [Cuts to overhead shot of the field as she walks away, Zuko following behind.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to later that night where Katara is seen dressed in a black cloak, tying her hair in a ponytail. Aang and Sokka watch her from behind a rock before emerging from behind it. \n",
      "AANG: So you were just gonna take Appa anyway? \n",
      "KATARA: Yes. \n",
      "AANG: It's okay, because I forgive you. [Pauses.] That give you any ideas? \n",
      "KATARA: Don't try to stop us. \n",
      "AANG: I wasn't planning to. This is a journey you need to take. You need to face this man. [Katara situates herself on Appa's head.] But when you do, please don't choose revenge. Let your anger out, and then let it go. Forgive him. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Sarcastically.] Okay, we'll be sure to do that, guru goody-goody. [Climbs aboard Appa.] \n",
      "KATARA: Thanks for understanding, Aang. Yip-yip. [Appa takes flight; Aang and Sokka look up at the departing bison, their backs facing the camera.] \n",
      "SOKKA: You know, you're pretty wise for a kid. \n",
      "AANG: Thanks, Sokka. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Cuts to shot of the two standing together looking up.] Usually it's annoying, but right now, I'm impressed. \n",
      "AANG: I appreciate that. \n",
      "SOKKA: So, can I borrow Momo for a week? \n",
      "AANG: [Surprised.] Why do you need Momo? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka simply shrugs.\n",
      "The scene changes to Zuko and Katara flying on Appa, heading straight for the camera. \n",
      "ZUKO: We need to find the Fire Navy communication tower. All the navy's movements are coordinated by messenger hawk. And every tower has to be up to date on where everyone is deployed. \n",
      "KATARA: [Cuts to shot of the communication tower situated on an island in the middle of the ocean; off-camera.] So once we find the communication tower, we bust in and take the information we need. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Voice-over.] Not exactly. We need to be stealthy and make sure no one spots us, [Cuts to shot of the communication tower, the camera panning downward.] otherwise they'll warn the Southern Raiders long before we reach them. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene switches to where Zuko and Katara run out from behind a mass of large rocks. Using waterbending, Katara creates a raft of ice for her and Zuko to ride on to the communication tower. The scene cuts to a corridor of tower where the two are crouched in a corner, watching two guards walk out a door. After the guards have passed, they stealthily run through the open door. The scene cuts to a female guard sitting at a writing desk. The duo peers at her from overhead gratings. Katara waterbends the ink onto the guard's hands. She rises from the desk and walks away. Katara and Zuko use the time to comb through the files stored in the drawers. \n",
      "ZUKO: Okay, Southern Raiders. [Opens a scroll.] Bam. [Points to location on map; off-camera.] On patrol near Whaletail Island. \n",
      "KATARA: [Cuts to shot of Zuko and Katara looking at the map.] Whaletail Island, here we come. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to the next morning. Zuko arises from his sleep and looks at Katara steering Appa. She has dark circles under her eyes from lack of sleep. \n",
      "ZUKO: You should get some rest. We'll be there in a few hours. You'll need all your strength. \n",
      "KATARA: Oh, don't you worry about my strength. I have plenty. I'm not the helpless little girl I was when they came. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene fades into a flashback of the Southern Raiders' attack. \n",
      "YOUNG.KATARA: I'm going to find Mom. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She runs nervously past her brother. Several Water Tribe warriors are shown running about in a frantic motion. The camera focuses on Katara again, who arrives at their igloo and pushes back the curtain. \n",
      "YOUNG.KATARA: Mom! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She runs in to discover her mother seated on the floor, a man towering over her. \n",
      "KYA: Just let her go and I'll give you the information you want. \n",
      "YON.RHA: You heard your mother. Get out of here! \n",
      "YOUNG.KATARA: Mommy, I'm scared. \n",
      "KYA: Go find your dad, sweetie. I'll handle this. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara gazes into the menacing eyes of the Southern Raiders commander and runs off. The scene changes to her sprinting across the snowy battlefield. \n",
      "KATARA: [Voice-over.] I ran as fast as I could. \n",
      "YOUNG.KATARA: [Arrives to where her father is battling Fire Nation soldiers.] Dad, Dad! Please, I think Mom's in trouble! There's a man in our house! \n",
      "HAKODA: Kya! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two run to their house frantically. Hakoda pushes back the blue drapes before the scene fades to white back to present day. \n",
      "KATARA: But we were too late. When we got there, the man was gone. [Voice begins breaking.] And so was she. \n",
      "ZUKO: Your mother was a brave woman. \n",
      "KATARA: [Clutches her necklace.] I know. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to later that night, where Zuko has taken command of Appa and Katara is sleeping on Appa's saddle. Zuko is looking through a telescope. \n",
      "ZUKO: There! [Katara looks up.] See those sea raven flags? [Tosses the telescope to Katara.] It's the Southern Raiders. \n",
      "KATARA: [Determined.] Let's do this. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Appa submerges underwater, Katara waterbending an air bubble around his head so they can breathe. The camera cuts to a shot of a group of Fire Nation soldiers having a conversation on the deck of the ship. \n",
      "SOLDIER: So there I was, and I was like, 'You know ...' \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He yells as a large water whip emerges from the surface and coils around his body, dragging him off the ship. The other soldiers run to the source of the incident in shock. Appa surfaces and Katara waterbends two huge waves at the ship. The others turn around to see the torrent of water flood the ship, washing them overboard. Appa lands on the deck. One soldier, who has managed to stay aboard the ship, attacks Katara, who pushes him away with a gush of water. She and Zuko make their way through the corridors of the ship, Katara's arms covered in water for defense. One soldier bursts from his cabin, a sword in hand only to be attacked and locked back inside by Zuko. Katara follows him to a large doorway, where they abruptly halt. \n",
      "ZUKO: This is it, Katara. Are you ready to face him? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara pulls down her face mask and lets out a cry as she sends a powerful stream of water toward the door. The scene changes to the inside of the room, the door having been knocked down by the impact of the water. The Southern Raiders commander attempts to attack Zuko, who only deflects his firebending attacks. \n",
      "SOUTHERN.RAIDERS.COMMANDER: Who are you? \n",
      "ZUKO: You don't remember her? You will soon, trust me. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The Southern Raiders commander prepares to strike once more, however, his hand fails to move and begins trembling. \n",
      "SOUTHERN.RAIDERS.COMMANDER: What's ... [He attempts to control his arm which bends about uncontrollably.] happening to me? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera focuses on Katara using bloodbending on him. With swift motions, she forces him to the ground. Zuko looks on at her, momentarily stunned before turning his attention back to the commander. \n",
      "ZUKO: Think back. Think back to your last raid on the Southern Water Tribe. \n",
      "SOUTHERN.RAIDERS.COMMANDER: [Helplessly subdued.] I don't know what you're talking about. Please, I don't know! \n",
      "ZUKO: [Bending down closer to the commander.] Don't lie! You look her in the eye and you tell me you don't remember what you did. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara bloodbends him, fixing him into a position where the Southern Raiders commander looks right into her eyes. She gives him a cold, hard stare. The camera closes up on one of the commander's eyes before cutting to where Katara's face has changed from one of hate to one of shock. \n",
      "KATARA: It's not him. [She frees him from her grip.] He's not the man. \n",
      "ZUKO: What? What do you mean he's not? He's the leader of the Southern Raiders! He has to be the guy! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara remains silent and begins walking away. Zuko grabs the weak commander and pins him to the wall. \n",
      "ZUKO: If you're not the man we're looking for, who is? \n",
      "SOUTHERN.RAIDERS.COMMANDER: You must be looking for Yon Rha. He retired four years ago. \n",

      "YON.RHA'S.MOTHER: Yon Rha! You lazy piece of work, I need something. \n",
      "YON.RHA: [Stops his work and attempts to placate.] Yes, Mother. What is it? \n",
      "YON.RHA'S.MOTHER: The tomato-carrots from your garden are too hard for my gums. I need something soft and juicy! \n",
      "YON.RHA: Would you like something else from the garden? I would be happy to ... \n",
      "YON.RHA'S.MOTHER: [Angrily. Her fists clench as she interrupts.] Forget your stupid garden! [Cut to a close-up of her as she yells at him; irritatingly.] Get your grimy hind to the market and buy me some real food! \n",

The scene changes to where Yon Rha is walking to the marketplace of the village, the place almost desolate. Yon Rha enters the screen. He begins to buy vegetables from a stand. A wind chime tinkles from one of the other stands. Yon Rha sharply turns around to view the suspicious activity. The camera view changes to someone ducking behind the stand. \n",

      "ZUKO: We weren't behind the bush. [Cut to a side view of the confrontation as Zuko takes a step forward to threaten Yon Rha.] And I wouldn't try firebending again! \n",

      "YON.RHA: You're lying. My source says there's one waterbender left in the Southern Water Tribe. We're not leaving until we find the waterbender! \n",
      "KYA: If I tell you, do you promise [She lowers her head and closes her eyes to make a decision.] to leave the rest of the village alone? [Cut to a side view of Yon Rha who nods.] It's me. [Cut to Kya who looks up.] Take me as your prisoner. \n",

      "KATARA: She lied to you! [Cut to a close-up of Katara who turns away from Yon Rha as she closes her eyes sadly.] She was protecting the last waterbender! \n",
      "YON.RHA: [Shocked.] What? Who? \n",
      "KATARA: [Cut back to Katara who turns to face him again as she opens her eyes and looks back furiously.] Me! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She holds both her arms out, halting the falling raindrops and creating a shield above the three of them. After a few moments, she sends a forceful stream of water at Yon Rha, transforming the stream into a flurry of ice daggers midway through her attack. Yon Rha crouches in fear, preparing to be hit. When he does not feel harmed, he looks up to see the ice daggers floating in midair. Katara's expression softens and she allows for the daggers to liquefy and drop to the ground. \n",
      "YON.RHA: [Falls to his knees.] I did a bad thing! I know I did and you deserve revenge, so why don't you take my mother? That would be fair! [Attempts to smile weakly.] \n",
      "KATARA: [Sorrowfully.] I always wondered what kind of person could do such a thing, but now that I see you, I think I understand. There's just nothing inside you, nothing at all. You're pathetic and sad and empty. \n",
      "YON.RHA: [Humbly.] Please, spare me! [Cries.] \n",
      "KATARA: But as much as I hate you ... I just can't do it. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara closes her eyes and lowers her head. Cut to Yon Rha, a hint of a smile gracing his lips upon realizing he will be spared. Without saying another word, Katara turns around and walks away; Zuko looks from Katara to Yon Rha, shooting the latter a last dirty look, and follows her. Yon Rha continues crying and shivering in the rain. The scene cuts to a boardwalk overlooking the water. It is later that day. Scene cuts to Katara, who is sitting on the edge of the dock, her eyes closed, paddling the water with her feet. She opens her eyes sadly as Aang and Zuko approach her. \n",
      "AANG: Katara? Are you okay? \n",
      "KATARA: I'm doing fine. \n",
      "AANG: Zuko told me what you did. Or what you didn't do, I guess. I'm proud of you. \n",
      "KATARA: I wanted to do it. I wanted to take out all my anger at him, but I couldn't. I don't know if it's because I'm too weak to do it or because I'm strong enough not to. \n",
      "AANG: You did the right thing. Forgiveness is the first step you have to take to begin healing. \n",
      "KATARA: [Rises from boardwalk.] But I didn't forgive him. I'll never forgive him. [Smiles at Zuko and walks up to him.] But I am ready to forgive you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two hug and Katara begins walking away. \n",
      "ZUKO: You were right about what Katara needed. Violence wasn't the answer. \n",
      "AANG: It never is. \n",
      "ZUKO: Then I have a question for you. [Turns to look at him.] What are you gonna do when you face my father? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Camera focuses on Aang, who now has a worried expression on his face. Fades to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode begins at Ozai's home on Ember Island. Cut to overhead shot of a courtyard where Aang and Zuko practice firebending using synchronized fire blasts. Cut to ground-level shot of the two as they create sweeping arcs of fire that dissipate into the ground. They each raise an arm and leg, sending forth streams of fire, before leaning forward and sending forth another stream of fire. Cut to closer shot of Aang and Zuko as they stand upright, assuming a final fighting stance before closing their eyes, relaxing their postures, and taking a deep breath. Toph and Katara are seen in the background, sitting on steps nearby. Zuko and Aang bow to one another, and the latter stretches his arms and walks away. Cut to Katara and Toph, who is lying down on the ground, relaxing. \n",
      "KATARA: Doesn't it seem kind of weird that we're hiding from the Fire Lord in his own house? \n",
      "ZUKO: I told you, [Cut to Zuko sitting on a dry fountain and wiping his head with a cloth.] my father hasn't come here since our family was actually happy. And that was a long time ago. It's the last place anyone would think to look for us. \n",

      "SOKKA: Listen to this ... [Turns the poster toward him.] \"The Boy in the Iceberg is a new production from acclaimed playwright Pu-on Tim, [Cut to a close shot of the poster as the camera pans up.] who scoured the globe gathering information on the Avatar, from the icy South Pole to the heart of Ba Sing Se.

      "SUKI: \"Brought to you by the critically acclaimed Ember Island Players.\" \n",
      "ZUKO: [Recalling a memory.] Ugh! My mother used to take us to see them. They butchered Love Amongst the Dragons every year! \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka, do you really think it's a good idea to attend a play about ourselves? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Persuasively.] Come on, a day at the theater? This is the kind of wacky time-wasting nonsense I've been missing! [He holds up the poster anxiously and smiles sheepishly; Katara looks away, appears nonplussed.] \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The curtain rises to reveal a set representative of the South Pole seas. Actress Katara and Actor Sokka are rowing their boat along.

      "ACTRESS.KATARA: It appears to be someone frozen in ice, perhaps for a hundred years. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She performs a karate chop, mimicking waterbending. The silhouette disappears from view and the prop splits in half, sending forth a jet of steam. An actress, meant to portray Aang, leaps up on screen and poses, winking and with one hand on hip. The actress is visibly wearing a flesh-colored cap over her hair to portray herself as bald; the cap also bears the airbending mastery tattoo. She wears an excessive amount of blush on her cheeks and her overall physiognomy and demeanor clearly display her femininity.\n",
      "Cut to shot of the actual Aang who momentarily closes his eyes and cringes in disbelief before leaning forward over the railing even more, eyes bugging out. Cuts back to the actors on stage. \n",
      "ACTRESS.KATARA: Who are you, frozen boy? \n",
      "ACTRESS.AANG: [Laughs; in a high-pitched voice.] I'm the Avatar, silly, here to spread joy and fun! [She leans toward Actress Katara, laying a finger on her lips, and also motions toward Actor Sokka before standing upright and spreading her arms out in a cheery gesture.] \n",
      "AANG: Wait, is that a woman playing me? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A crude, costumed-version of Appa suddenly bursts up from behind the trio of actors; loud festival music previously heard in the episode \"Avatar Day\" is presently played.

      "ACTRESS.AANG: [Stoops down, puts her arm around Actor Sokka's shoulders, and points upward.] But wait! Is that a platter of meaty dumplings? [Cut to actual Aang whose head and arm rest lazily on the railing, unimpressed.] \n",

The actor portraying Iroh stands at the helm.\n",

      "ACTOR.IROH: Prince Zuko, you must try this cake! [Holds up a platter of cake with one slice missing.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Actor Zuko looking through the telescope. He wears a headpiece that sports the ponytail Zuko once wore, albeit slightly exaggerated, and Zuko's scar; the replicated scar, while realistic, is worn over the wrong eye. \n",

      "ZUKO: [Gestures toward the stage.] They make me look totally stiff and humorless. \n",
      "KATARA: [Complacently amused.] Actually, I think that actor's pretty spot on. \n",
      "ZUKO: [In protest; holding his arms out.] How could you say that? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the bow of the model ship where Actor Zuko has resumed peering through his telescope. Actor Iroh stands behind him. \n",
      "ACTOR.IROH: [Completely at ease.] Let's forget about the Avatar and get massages! \n",

      "AANG: [Standing up.] Argh! \n",

      "ACTOR.TOPH: [Laughs.] I can see you doing that. I see everything that you see, except I don't \"see\" like you do. I release a sonic wave from my mouth.

The audience and Team Avatar grimace at the scream; Aang claps his hands over his ears, Zuko grips the railing in front of him, Suki and Sokka hug each other in terror, and Katara grits her teeth while Toph looks excited.] There.

      "ACTOR.ZUKO: [Stands up.] Wait, I thought you were the Avatar's girl! [Aang nods.] \n",
      "ACTRESS.KATARA: [Laughs.] The Avatar? [Stands up and walks toward Actor Zuko.] Why, he's like a little brother to me! [Laughs.] I certainly don't think of him in a romantic way. [Aang grows concerned.] Besides, how could he ever find out about ... this? [Actress Katara and Actor Zuko embrace and hold hands while Actress Katara pops up one leg. Aang gets up.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Whispering.] Oh, you're getting up? [As Aang leaves.] Can you get me some fire flakes? [Puts his arm around Suki, but whispers to Aang again.] Ooh, and fire gummies! [Puts his arm back around Suki, who looks slightly annoyed.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Actor Zuko standing between Actor Azula, who has a Fire Nation flag behind her, and Actor Iroh, who has an Earth Kingdom flag behind him. A light shines on Actor Zuko. \n",
      "ACTRESS.AZULA: Well, my brother, what's it going to be? Your nation, or a life of treachery? \n",
      "ACTOR.IROH: [Stops drinking from a cup.] Choose treachery, it's more fun! [Winks and gives a thumbs up sign.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Actor Zuko walks toward Actor Iroh. \n",
      "ACTRESS.AZULA: No way! \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Actress Mai, who pulls a sword out of her hair and gives it to a ninja, who takes a guard away. The shot changes to show the stage is set up to resemble the Earth King's throne room. Actress Ty Lee jumps to the other guard, kisses her finger and touches the guard's shoulder, causing him to fall over. Actress Azula jumps behind Actress Ty Lee and they pose. The audience applauds.

      "ACTRESS.AANG: Avatar State, yip yip! \n",

      "Fade to outside the theater, where everyone except Aang is present for the second intermission. \n",
      "SUKI: It seems like every time there's a big battle, you guys barely make it out alive. I mean, you guys lose a lot! \n",
      "SOKKA: You're one to talk, Suki. Didn't Azula take you captive? That's right, she did! \n",
      "SUKI: [Looks at Sokka seriously.] Are you trying to get on my bad side? \n",
      "SOKKA: I'm just saying ... \n",

      "AANG: [Angered.] No, I'm not! I hate this play! [Yanks his hat off and throws it on the ground.] \n",
      "KATARA: I know it's upsetting, but it sounds like you're overreacting. \n",
      "AANG: Overreacting? If I hadn't blocked my chakra, I'd probably be in the Avatar State right now! \n",

      "SOKKA: Suki, what are the chances you can get me backstage? I got some jokes I want to give to the actor me. \n",
      "SUKI: [Seriously.] I'm an elite warrior who's trained for many years in the art of stealth. [Smiling.] I think I could get you backstage! [Sokka and Suki leave.] \n",
      "TOPH: [To Zuko, after observing everyone's reactions.] Geez, everyone's getting so upset about their characters. Even you seem more down than usual, and that's saying something! \n",
      "ZUKO: You don't get it, it's different for you. You get a muscly version of yourself, taking down ten bad guys at once, and making sassy remarks. \n",
      "TOPH: Yeah, that's pretty great! \n",
      "ZUKO: But for me, it takes all the mistakes I've made in my life, and shoves them back in my face. My uncle, he's always been on my side, even when things were bad. He was there for me, he taught me so much, and how do I repay him? With a knife in his back. It's my greatest regret, and I may never get to redeem myself. \n",
      "TOPH: [Sits down next to him.] You have redeemed yourself to your uncle. You don't realize it, but you already have. \n",
      "ZUKO: How do you know? \n",
      "TOPH: Because I once had a long conversation with the guy, and all he would talk about was you. \n",
      "ZUKO: Really? \n",
      "TOPH: Yeah, and it was kind of annoying. \n",
      "ZUKO: Oh, sorry. \n",
      "TOPH: But it was also very sweet. All your uncle wanted was for you to find your own path, and see the light. Now you're here with us. He'd be proud. [Punches Zuko on the shoulder.] \n",
      "ZUKO: Ow! What was that for? \n",
      "TOPH: That's how I show affection. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The same boy with the Aang costume comes by and sees Zuko. \n",
      "YOUNG.BOY: Your Zuko costume's pretty good, but your scar's on the wrong side. [Runs off.] \n",

      "ACTOR.SOKKA: Can I help you? \n",
      "SOKKA: Actually, I think I can help you. I'm a big Sokka fan, but I don't think you're representing him quite as well as you could be. \n",
      "ACTOR.SOKKA: [Starts walking away.] Aww no, another fan with ideas. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Runs in front of him.] Just hear me out. [Pulls out some cards.] Here's something I think the real Sokka would say. [Clears throat.] What does the cabbage merchant use to fix his cabbages? A cabbage patch! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Suki gives herself a face palm in the background. \n",
      "ACTOR.SOKKA: [Chuckles.] That's actually pretty good! Let me see those! [Takes the cards from Sokka. Reads one and laughs.] \"A rocky relationship\" ... not bad! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Puts his arm around Actor Sokka's shoulder.] Also, don't be afraid to make up some phrases, especially before an attack. Something like ... \"Flying kick-a-pow!\". [The two begin to walk away.] \n",
      "ACTOR.SOKKA: Who are you, anyway? \n",
      "SOKKA: I'm just a guy who likes comedy. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the full moon. The shot changes to show Katara and Aang alone on the balcony. \n",
      "AANG: Katara, did you really mean what you said in there? \n",
      "KATARA: In where? What are you talking about? \n",
      "AANG: On stage, when you said I was just like a ... brother to you, and you didn't have feelings for me. \n",
      "KATARA: I didn't say that. An actor said that. \n",
      "AANG: But it's true, isn't it? We kissed at the Invasion, and I thought we were gonna be together. But we're not. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, I don't know. \n",
      "AANG: Why don't you know? \n",
      "KATARA: Because, we're in the middle of a war, and, we have other things to worry about. This isn't the right time. \n",
      "AANG: Well, when is the right time? \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, I'm sorry, but right now I'm just a little confused. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang tries to kiss Katara. \n",
      "KATARA: I just said I was confused! I'm going inside. [Exits the balcony.] \n",
      "AANG: Ugh, I'm such an idiot! [Puts down his head on the balcony railing.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to back inside the theater. Aang returns to the rest of the group and sits in the back row with Suki and Sokka. \n",
      "SOKKA: Here's what you missed ... we went to the Fire Nation, and you got better, and Katara was the Painted Lady, and I got a sword, and I think Combustion Man died. Oh, look, the Invasion's about to start! Shhh! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Actresses Katara and Aang standing on one of the submarines. \n",
      "ACTRESS.KATARA: I just wanted to let you know, Aang, that I'll always love you. Like a brother. \n",
      "ACTRESS.AANG: [Punching the air.] I wouldn't want it any other way! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The two shake hands. Actress Aang opens his miniature glider and flies up via a rope. Actress Katara waves. Aang curls up and uses his hat to cover his face. Actress Katara and Actors Toph and Sokka looking around on top of the submarine. \n",
      "ACTOR.SOKKA: Hey Toph, would you say you and Aang have a \"rocky relationship\"? [Audience laughs.] \n",
      "SOKKA: [Laughs hysterically at Suki and Aang. Lifts up Aang's hat.] I told him to say that! \n",
      "ACTOR.SOKKA: I hope everyone's ready for the Invasion! Slap-a-pow! [The audience and Sokka laugh.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The curtain rises, two stagehands clad in black finish pushing the Royal Palace prop and run off stage. Actress Katara and Actors Toph and Sokka enter from the sides of the stage, while Actress Aang is dropped in from above the stage. \n",

      "SOKKA: [Stands up and stretches.] I guess that's it. The play's caught up to the present now. \n",
      "SUKI: Wait, the play's not over! \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sits back down.] But it is over, unless ... [Dramatically.] this is the future. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Actor Ozai on stage. The shot changes to show him standing on the Royal Palace prop. An orange lantern held by a small cable with paper flames slowly moves across the stage. \n",

      "ACTRESS.AZULA: We'll see! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Actress Azula pulls out her blue streamer and snaps it at Zuko who ducks out of the way. Actor Zuko holds two red streamers and jumps to the other side of Actress Azula. He throws his two red streamers at her and Actress Azula jumps over him. Actress Azula raises her hand not holding the blue streamer. Five red paper resembling flames shot from the ground starting at Actress Azula, the last one covering Actor Zuko so that only his silhouette can be seen. \n",
      "ACTOR.ZUKO: Honor! [He drops off stage through a trapdoor with the flames.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Actress Azula bows. The audience cheers. Zuko looks worried and the rest of Team Avatar looks at him. The shot changes to show the stage, which has small paper flames fluttering upstage. Actress Aang walks across the stage and looks around while Actor Ozai sits on his throne beneath the Sozin's Comet prop. \n",
      "ACTOR.OZAI: So, you have mastered all four elements? \n",
      "ACTRESS.AANG: [Pointing her staff prop at him.] Yeah, and now you're going down! \n",
      "ACTOR.OZAI: No! It is you who are going down! [Stands up.] You see, you are too late! The comet is already here, [Actress Aang looks in concern at the audience. Aang widens his eyes.] and I'm unstoppable! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Actor Ozai wields two red streamers. He attacks Actress Aang, who jumps out of the way. Actress Aang opens her glider, which now has two small blue banners pop out. She twirls the weapon. Actor Ozai circles his streamers while Actress Aang jumps over him with the help of a rope. She tries to get close to Actor Ozai, but Actor Ozai makes her back away using his red streamers. Actress Aang jumps over Actor Ozai, who fires a constant stream of red streamers at her. When Actress Aang lands, Actor Ozai sends a large red sheet painted as fire at her. A black clad stagehand lets go of the prop and runs away. \n",

      "SOKKA: [Walking with Suki.] But the effects were decent! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens on Ember Island outside Ozai's beach house. Aang practices firebending punches. Zuko watches him with his arms crossed. \n",
      "ZUKO: More ferocious! Imagine striking through your opponent's heart! \n",
      "AANG: [Stops firebending and turns to Zuko while growling in irritance.] I'm trying. \n",
      "ZUKO: Now let me hear you roar like a tigerdillo! [Aang gives a light roar as fire bursts come out of his hands and mouth; cuts to a front scene of his embarrassed grin.] That sounded pathetic! I said roar! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang roars even louder, as three bursts of fire come out of his hands and mouth. Momo runs and hides behind Zuko's leg in fear. Zuko nods approvingly. \n",
      "KATARA: [Holding up two watermelons.] Who wants a nice cool glass of watermelon juice? \n",

      "ZUKO: [Zuko's hand comes into screen and grabs Aang by the shirt of his robes.] Hey! [Aang keeps trying to run off, but it is useless.] Your lesson's not over yet! Get back here! [Holds Aang up.] \n",
      "SUKI: [Lounging on stairs with Sokka.] Come on, Zuko. Just take a break. What's the big deal? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Lets Aang go.] Fine! [Aang happily runs off and takes a watermelon.] If you want to lounge around like a bunch of snail sloths all day, then go ahead! [Walks away.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Maybe Zuko's right. Sitting around the house has made us pretty lazy. But I know [Lays his watermelon aside and stands up slowly.] just the thing to change all that. [Takes off his robe, revealing a bathing suit.] Beach party! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Dives excitedly out of the camera's view. Camera changes scene to the ocean to show that he entered the water with a splash. Sokka surfaces with seaweed on his head and he blows water from his mouth. He grins goofily. Katara uses waterbending to create an ice surfboard and surfs on the water. Cut to Suki, watching Sokka grab some seaweed and bring it to an area. He takes two buckets and fills them with water. Aang sticks the last piece of wood on a life-sized sand sculpture of Appa, finishing the last horn. \n",
      "AANG: Check out my Appa sand sculpture. [Appa roars at the sculpture.] \n",
      "TOPH: Not bad, baldy, [Aang jumps off the sculpture.] but I've been working on my sandbending. [Cracks her fingers.] You're gonna love this. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph cracks her knuckles and uses sandbending to create a sand replica of the city of Ba Sing Se. Aang peers down at the replica's details. \n",
      "AANG: [Amazed.] Whoa! Wow, you've even made a little Earth King and Bosco. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka works hard on a sculpture. \n",
      "TOPH: Try and top that, Sokka. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Reveals a grotesque looking sculpture with seaweed for hair, a starfish for a nose, and rocks and shells for eyes and mouth.] Ta da! \n",
      "AANG: Is that a blubbering blob monster? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Defensively.] No, it's Suki! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang looks at him with an animated shocked and surprised look until he and Toph both laugh hysterically. \n",
      "TOPH: Suki, we'll all understand if you break up with him over this. \n",
      "SUKI: [Sitting on a beach towel.] I think it's sweet. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka runs and slides into screen on his knees as he grabs Suki by her shoulders and kisses her on the cheek. \n",
      "AANG: But it doesn't even look like- Aah! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: He is cut off by a fire blast that destroys the sculpture. Zuko appears and chases after Aang, blasting at him with firebending. Aang jumps over the sand replica of Ba Sing Se and Zuko destroys the replica. Aang hides behind his Appa sand sculpture. \n",
      "AANG: [Peeking out from behind the sculpture fearfully.] What are you doing? \n",
      "ZUKO: Teaching you a lesson! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko destroys Aang's Appa sculpture with a fire blast. Aang jumps back up to the house. Zuko goes after him, continually firing blasts at him. Katara comes back to shore and sees the destruction. \n",
      "KATARA: What happened? \n",
      "SOKKA: [While rebuilding his sculpture.] Zuko's gone crazy! I made a sand sculpture of Suki and he destroyed it! [Pauses a moment.] Oh, and he's attacking Aang. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara, Toph, and Suki run after them, the latter dragging Sokka. Zuko chases Aang onto a tree and sends another fire blast at him, forcing him to jump onto the roof of the beach house. Zuko subsequently climbs onto the roof with him. \n",
      "AANG: Get a grip before I blast you off this roof! \n",
      "ZUKO: Go ahead and do it! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko blasts fire at him. Aang slides down the roof and into the house. He hides behind a dresser. Zuko breaks the roof with firebending and drops into the room. He takes a fighting stance and looks around for Aang. Aang kicks the dresser at him, but Zuko destroys it. Aang runs into the hall. Zuko augments fire into the hallway. Aang clears his part of the hallway from the fire using airbending. \n",
      "AANG: Enough! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang airbends Zuko out of the house. Everyone approaches Zuko. \n",
      "KATARA: [Worried.] What's wrong with you? You could have hurt Aang! \n",
      "ZUKO: What's wrong with me? What's wrong with all of you? How can you sit around having beach parties when Sozin's Comet is only three days away? [Everybody looks at Zuko.] Why are you all looking at me like I'm crazy? \n",
      "AANG: About Sozin's Comet ... I was actually gonna wait to fight the Fire Lord until after it came. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Shocked.] After? \n",
      "AANG: I'm not ready. I need more time to master firebending. \n",
      "TOPH: And frankly, your earthbending could still use some work too. [Aang grimaces.] \n",
      "ZUKO: So, you all knew Aang was going to wait? \n",
      "SOKKA: Honestly, if Aang tries to fight the Fire Lord now, he's going to lose. [Aang looks over to Sokka as he says this, frowns, and closes his eyes in defeat. To Aang.] No offense. \n",
      "KATARA: The whole point of fighting the Fire Lord before the Comet was to stop the Fire Nation from winning the War, but they pretty much won the War when they took Ba Sing Se. Things can't get any worse. \n",
      "ZUKO: You're wrong. [Turns away from them.] It's about to get worse than you can even imagine. [Flashes back to one day before the Day of Black Sun. Servants help Zuko get dressed on his way to a meeting. Once done, they stay behind and bow to him as he walks on. Voice-over.] The day before the eclipse, my father asked me to attend an important war meeting. It was what I dreamed about for so many years. My father had finally accepted me back. \n",
      "OZAI: Welcome, Prince Zuko. We waited for you. [Zuko walks up to his father. He bows to Ozai and sits down next to him.] General Shinu, your report. \n",
      "SHINU: Thank you, sir. [Stands up and walks up to the opposite side of Ozai across the table.] Ba Sing Se is still under our control. However, earthbender rebellions have prevented us from achieving total victory in the Earth Kingdom. \n",
      "OZAI: What is your recommendation? \n",
      "SHINU: Our army is spread too thin, but once the eclipse is over and the invasion defeated, we should transfer more domestic forces into the Earth Kingdom. \n",
      "OZAI: Hmm. Prince Zuko, you've been among the Earth Kingdom commoners. Do you think that adding more troops will stop these rebellions? \n",
      "ZUKO: The people of the Earth Kingdom are proud and strong. They can endure anything, as long as they have hope. \n",
      "OZAI: Yes, you're right. We need to destroy their hope. \n",
      "ZUKO: Well, that's not exactly what I- \n",
      "AZULA: I think you should take their precious hope and the rest of their land and burn it all to the ground. \n",
      "OZAI: Yes ... [Cuts to Azula looking pleased.] Yes you're right, Azula. [Stands up and walks to the world map.] Sozin's Comet is almost upon us, and on that day, it will endow us with the strength and power of a hundred suns. No bender will stand a chance against us. \n",
      "SHINU: What are you suggesting, sir? \n",
      "OZAI: When the comet last came, my grandfather, Fire Lord Sozin, used it to wipe out the Air Nomads. [Cut to Zuko.] Now, I will use its power to end the Earth Kingdom ... [Zuko looks astonished. Cut back to Ozai smiling.] permanently. [The shot changes to an aerial view of the map which Ozai walks to the center.] From our airships, we will rain fire over their lands, a fire that will destroy everything; and out of the ashes, a new world will be born, a world in which all the lands are Fire Nation and I am the supreme ruler of everything! [War generals applaud.] \n",
      "ZUKO: [Voice-over.] I wanted to speak out against this horrifying plan, but I'm ashamed to say I didn't. [Fade to the present.] My whole life, I struggled to gain my father's love and acceptance, but once I had it, I realized I'd lost myself getting there. I'd forgotten who I was. \n",
      "KATARA: [Sinks to her knees.] I can't believe this. \n",
      "SOKKA: I always knew the Fire Lord was a bad guy, but his plan is just pure evil. \n",
      "AANG: What am I gonna do? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Stands up from his rock seat and walks to Aang.] I know you're scared, and I know you're not ready to save the world, but if you don't defeat the Fire Lord before the comet comes, there won't be a world to save anymore. \n",
      "AANG: Why didn't you tell me about your dad's crazy plan sooner? [Walks away.] \n",
      "ZUKO: I didn't think I had to. I assumed you were still going to fight him before the comet. No one told me you decided to wait. \n",
      "AANG: [Holding his head with both hands.] This is bad. [Sinks down to his knees.] This is really, really bad. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, you don't have to do this alone. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph, Zuko, Sokka, and Suki stand next to Katara. \n",
      "TOPH: Yeah, if we all fight the Fire Lord together, we got a shot at taking him down. \n",
      "SOKKA: All right! Team Avatar is back! Air. [Shot of Aang.] Water. [Shot of Katara.] Earth. [Shot of Toph.] Fire. [Shot of Zuko. Sokka gives Suki a clump of leaves and holds up a large leaf.] Fan and sword! [Sokka's leaf wilts.] \n",
      "AANG: Fighting the Fire Lord is going to be the hardest thing we've ever done together, but I wouldn't want to do it any other way. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Everybody except Zuko laughs and walks over to Aang for a group hug. \n",
      "TOPH: Yeah. \n",
      "SOKKA: All right. \n",
      "KATARA: Get over here, Zuko. Being part of the group also means being part of group hugs. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: With a resigned look on his face, Zuko joins the hug. Appa flies in, knocking the entire group over. The camera cuts to the beach house courtyard in another lesson between Aang and Zuko. Under the pavilion, Katara watches with Momo at her side. \n",
      "ZUKO: There's one technique you need to know before facing my father - how to redirect lightning. [Aang smiles.] If you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it. [Uses his fingers to show how the energy should flow through the body.] You turn your opponents' energy against them. \n",
      "AANG: That's like waterbending. [Joins Zuko in practicing the lightning redirection form.] \n",
      "ZUKO: Exactly. My uncle invented this technique himself by studying waterbenders. \n",
      "AANG: So, have you ever redirected lightning before? \n",
      "ZUKO: Once, against my father. \n",
      "AANG: What did it feel like? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Stops practicing the lightning redirection form.] Exhilarating ... [Flashes back to the moment for a few seconds.] but terrifying. You feel so powerful holding that much energy in your body, but you know if you make the wrong move, it's over. \n",
      "AANG: [Chuckles.] Well, not over over. I mean there's always Katara and a little Spirit Water action, [Turns to Katara.] am I right? \n",
      "KATARA: Actually, I used it all up after Azula shot you. \n",
      "AANG: [Disappointed.] Oh. \n",
      "ZUKO: You'll have to take the Fire Lord's life before he takes yours. \n",
      "AANG: Yeah, I'll just do that. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to the rocky cliffs near the beach. \n",
      "SOKKA: Gather round, Team Avatar. [Puts a carved melon on a draped mannequin.] In order to take out the Fire Lord - or in this case, the Melon Lord - our timing has to be perfect. [Kneels down on the ground and uses a stick to draw a line heading toward the Melon Lord symbol.] First, Suki and I will draw his fire. Then, Katara and Zuko charge in with some liquidy hot offense, [Draws another line.] and while the Melon Lord is distracted, [Draws a third line.] Aang swoops in ... and bam! [Destroys the Melon Lord symbol with the line.] He delivers the final blow. \n",
      "TOPH: Uh ... what about me? \n",
      "SOKKA: For now, you're the Melon Lord's forces. \n",
      "TOPH: [Excited.] So I get to chuck flaming rocks at all of you? \n",
      "SOKKA: Whatever makes the training feel more realistic. \n",
      "TOPH: Sweetness. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to the Melon Lord. The camera pulls back to show Toph surrounded by boulder coated in grease with small bowls of fire set out in front of each boulder. \n",
      "TOPH: Mwah-ha-ha-ha! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara and Sokka look at Aang and Momo who look at Suki and Sokka. Sokka signals to the others to start moving. Sokka and Suki run toward the Melon Lord, but become confronted by stone Fire Nation soldiers, who suddenly rise out of the ground. Sokka cuts one stone soldier in half and Suki kicks down another one. They keep running, but a large burning rock boulder falls out of the sky, blocking the camera's view of them. Suki jumps over the boulder. Sokka finds himself fallen down just a few inches away from the flaming boulder and jumps up. \n",
      "SOKKA: Watch it, Toph! \n",
      "TOPH: I am not Toph. I am Melon Lord! Mwah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph lights a second boulder on fire and sends it through the air at Zuko and Katara. They run around the boulder and become surrounded by a circle of stone Fire Nation soldiers, which they quickly destroy. \n",
      "SOKKA: Now, Aang! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang jumps, preparing to strike the Melon Lord with his glider staff. Aang looks at the Melon Lord and changes expressions from anger to uncertainty. When he lands, Aang stops his attack just before smashing the Melon Lord. He backs away. \n",
      "ZUKO: What are you waiting for? Take him out! \n",
      "AANG: [Shaking his head.] I can't. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Walks up to Aang.] What's wrong with you? If this was the real deal, you'd be shot full of lightning right now. \n",
      "AANG: I'm sorry, but it just didn't feel right. I didn't feel like myself. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka takes out his sword. Cut to Aang, wincing as he hears squishing sounds. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Off-camera.] There, that's how it's done. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A piece of melon falls on the ground near the Melon Lord. Momo slurps some melon juice out of the piece. The camera zooms toward Aang, who is horrified at the scene. Later that night, Team Avatar shares a meal outside. Aang faces away from the rest of the group. \n",
      "KATARA: [Holding a scroll.] I have a surprise for everyone! \n",
      "TOPH: I knew it! You did have a secret thing with Haru! [She smiles while Sokka, Suki, and Zuko look at her strangely.] \n",
      "KATARA: Uh, no. [Everybody else starts eating again.] I was looking for cooking pots in the attic, and I found this! [Unravels the scroll showing a painting of a happy dark-haired baby playing at the beach.] Look at baby Zuko. Isn't he cute? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Everybody except Zuko laughs. \n",
      "KATARA: [To Zuko.] Oh, lighten up. I'm just teasing. \n",
      "ZUKO: That's not me. It's my father. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara rolls up the scroll. \n",
      "SUKI: But he looks so sweet and innocent. \n",
      "ZUKO: Well, that sweet little kid grew up to be a monster, and the worst father in the history of fathers. \n",
      "AANG: [The camera pans to him.] But he's still a human being. \n",
      "ZUKO: You're going to defend him? \n",
      "AANG: No, I agree with you. [Stands up.] Fire Lord Ozai is a horrible person, and the world would probably be better off without him, but there's got to be another way. \n",
      "ZUKO: Like what? \n",
      "AANG: I don't know. [Perking up.] Maybe we can make some big pots of glue, and then I can use gluebending to stick his arms and legs together so he can't bend anymore. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Sarcastically.] Yeah, then you can show him his baby pictures, and all those happy memories will make him good again. [Suki and Sokka laugh in the background.] \n",
      "AANG: [Excitedly.] Do you really think that would work? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Bluntly.] No! \n",
      "AANG: [Sighs. Paces back and forth.] This goes against everything I learned from the monks. I can't just go around wiping out people I don't like. \n",
      "SOKKA: Sure you can. You're the Avatar. If it's in the name of keeping balance, I'm pretty sure the universe will forgive you. \n",
      "AANG: [Turns back to Sokka; losing his temper.] This isn't a joke, Sokka! None of you understand the position I'm in. \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, we do understand. It's just ... \n",
      "AANG: Just what, Katara? What? \n",
      "KATARA: We're trying to help! \n",
      "AANG: Then, when you figure out a way for me to beat the Fire Lord without taking his life, I'd love to hear it! [Walks away.] \n",
      "KATARA: Aang, don't walk away from this. [Walks toward Aang.] \n",
      "ZUKO: [Puts a hand on Katara's shoulder to stop her.] Let him go. He needs time to sort it out by himself. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang meditates at the beach house porch in front of four candles, some berries, a plate of fruit, and a small cup of water. Momo flies in front of Aang. \n",
      "AANG: [Stroking the lemur's head.] Hey, Momo. I don't suppose you know what I should do. [Momo squawks.] I didn't think so. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Momo lays down to rest, and soon Aang falls asleep too after the candles have burnt out. The camera pans out from the beach house to an island. Aang wakes up to chanting and walks toward the mysterious island, barely awake with Momo following him. Aang starts swimming when he reaches the water. The scene changes to the next morning and the mysterious island is gone. Appa eats some hay while Sokka sits on his saddle. \n",
      "SOKKA: Okay, that's everything. \n",
      "TOPH: No, it's not. Where's Aang? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Team Avatar runs to the beach house. \n",
      "ZUKO: Aang? Aang! \n",
      "TOPH: Come on, lazy bones, let's go. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Suki and Katara run to check one side of the beach house. Sokka, Zuko, and Toph run to check the other side. Zuko opens a door, but does not find Aang. Toph shrugs to show Zuko she has not found him either. Zuko checks the porch, scratching his head. He spots Aang's staff as Katara and Suki follow him. \n",
      "SOKKA: He left his staff. [Picks up the staff.] That's so strange. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Walks onto the porch with Toph.] Aang's not in the house. Let's check the beach. [Turns his head toward the beach.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to the beach. \n",
      "SOKKA: Look, there's his footprints. [The camera pans up toward Aang's footprints, which stop at the beach.] The trail ends here. \n",
      "SUKI: So, he went for a midnight swim and never came back? \n",
      "KATARA: Maybe he was captured. \n",
      "SOKKA: I don't think so. [Examining the footprints.] There's no sign of a struggle. \n",
      "TOPH: I bet he ran away again. \n",
      "SOKKA: Uh-uh. He left behind his glider and Appa. \n",
      "TOPH: Then what do you think happened to him, oh sleuthy one? \n",
      "SOKKA: It's pretty obvious. Aang mysteriously disappears before an important battle? He's definitely on a Spirit World journey. \n",
      "ZUKO: But if he was, wouldn't his body still be here? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Downcast.] Oh, yeah. Forgot about that. \n",
      "KATARA: Then he's got to be somewhere on Ember Island. Let's split up and look for him. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Toph latches onto Zuko's arm. Zuko blushes. \n",
      "TOPH: I'm going with Zuko! [Sokka, Suki, and Katara stare at her.] What?! Everyone else went on a life-changing field trip with Zuko. Now it's my turn. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka rides on Appa, searching the shores for Aang. In Harbor City, Suki and Katara approach a group of people gathered in a circle. \n",
      "CROWD: [Chanting.] Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! Aang! [Shocked, Katara and Suki glance at each other and simultaneously run into the circle.] \n",
      "ACTRESS.AANG: [In the center of the crowd.] Avatar State! [Actor Toph lifts her up in the air.] Yip-yip! [Crowd cheers.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Suki and Katara become frustrated by the false lead. The scene changes to Toph and Zuko walking along the beach. \n",
      "TOPH: And then when I was nine, I ran away again. \n",
      "ZUKO: Uh-huh. \n",
      "TOPH: I know I shouldn't complain. My parents gave me everything I ever asked for, but they never gave me the one thing I really wanted, their love. You know what I mean? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Sighs and stops walking.] Look, I know you had a really rough childhood, but we should really focus on finding Aang. [Continues walking.] \n",
      "TOPH: This is the worst field trip ever. [Sighs and continues walking.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Later, back at the beach house, Toph, Zuko, Suki, and Katara sit on the beach house stairs. Sokka lands Appa below the stairs. \n",
      "SOKKA: Judging by the looks on your faces, I'm guessing you guys didn't find Aang, either. [Jumps off Appa.] \n",
      "ZUKO: No. It's like he just ... disappeared. \n",
      "TOPH: Hey, wait a minute. Has anyone noticed that Momo is missing, too? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Turns back to Appa.] Oh no! I knew it was only a matter of time! [Jumps down to Appa.] Appa ate Momo! [Lifts up Appa's mouth.] Momo, I'm coming for you, buddy. \n",
      "KATARA: Sokka, Appa didn't eat Momo. He's probably with Aang. \n",
      "SOKKA: That's just what Appa wants you to think. [Climbs into Appa's mouth.] \n",
      "ZUKO: Get out of the bison's mouth, Sokka. We have a real problem here. Aang is nowhere to be found and the comet is only two days away. \n",
      "KATARA: What should we do Zuko? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Katara, Suki, and Toph turn to stare at Zuko. In the background, Sokka slips out of Appa's mouth, covered in bison saliva. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Stands up.] I don't know. [They keep staring.] Why are you all looking at me? \n",
      "KATARA: Well, you are kind of the expert on tracking Aang. \n",
      "TOPH: Yeah, if anyone's got experience hunting the Avatar ... it's you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Sokka tries standing up in the background, but falls back down. Zuko nods. The scene changes to Appa flying along the coast, led by Zuko. \n",
      "SOKKA: Zuko, I don't wanna tell you how to do your job, but why are we heading towards the Earth Kingdom? There's no way Aang's there. \n",
      "ZUKO: Just trust me. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: An aerial shot of the Royal Palace. Ozai and Azula travel in palanquins to a ship. \n",
      "AZULA: [To her palanquin bearers.] Come on slowpokes! Faster! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Ozai walks out of his palanquin and up the stairs. Azula runs behind him and gets on one knee to bow. \n",
      "AZULA: [Pants.] Sorry I'm late, father. Good palanquin bearers are so hard to come by these days. So, is everything ready for our departure? \n",
      "OZAI: [Facing the ship.] There has been a change of plans, Azula. \n",
      "AZULA: [Worried.] What? \n",
      "OZAI: I've decided to lead the fleet of airships to Ba Sing Se alone. You will remain here in the Fire Nation. \n",
      "AZULA: But I thought we were going to do this together. \n",
      "OZAI: My decision is final. \n",
      "AZULA: You ... you can't treat me like this! [Rising.] You can't treat me like Zuko! \n",
      "OZAI: Azula, silence yourself. \n",
      "AZULA: But it was my idea to burn everything to the ground! I deserve to be by your side! \n",
      "OZAI: Azula! [She bows her head.] Listen to me. I need you here to watch over the homeland. It's a very important job that I can only entrust to you. \n",
      "AZULA: Really? \n",
      "OZAI: And for your loyalty, I've decided to declare you the new Fire Lord. \n",
      "AZULA: Fire Lord Azula? It does seem appropriate, but what about you? \n",
      "OZAI: Fire Lord Ozai is no more. Just as the world will be reborn in fire, I shall be reborn as the supreme ruler of the world. [Three Fire Sages help Ozai put on his new royal garments.] From this moment on, I will be known as ... [Raises his arms in the air.] the Phoenix King. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Servants pull up the phoenix emblem behind Ozai. Soldiers raise the phoenix flags beside the Fire Nation flags. Two more soldiers firebend into the base of the flag pole, causing fire to shoot out at the sides. The crowd bows before their new king. The camera cuts to Ozai and zooms out. Cut to an aerial view of a tavern as Team Avatar approaches. Inside the tavern, lively music plays. Zuko enters, followed by Katara, Sokka, Suki, and Toph. \n",
      "KATARA: And the reason you've brought us to a seedy Earth Kingdom tavern is what now? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Pointing.] June. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera zooms toward June, who holds a drink. A thug tries to attack her, but she makes him fall down and uses him as a foot rest. Another thug tries to punch her, but she dodges every punch, still holding her drink. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Off-camera.] Oh yeah, that weird bounty hunter with the giant mole. \n",
      "SUKI: [Off-camera.] Mole? Her skin is flawless. \n",
      "SOKKA: No, she has this giant mole creature she rides around on. \n",
      "ZUKO: The shirshu. It's the only animal that can track Aang's scent anywhere in the world. It's the one shot we have of finding him. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The second thug continues punching June. She throws her drink into the air, throws the thug at a table, catches her drink and takes a sip. \n",
      "TOPH: [Stepping forward, grinning broadly.] I don't know who this June lady is, but I like her. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Aang sleeping on a mysterious island, while Momo licks his cheek. \n",
      "AANG: [Waking up.] Hey, Momo. I just had the strangest dream. [Looks around surprised at his new setting.] Wait. [The camera pans toward the ocean and shows an aerial shot of the island.] Where are we? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Fade to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens at night to a wide shot of the Earth Kingdom tavern, Appa resting outside. Cut inside to frontal view of Team Avatar, sans Aang. June kicks a chair in the foreground and sits down and begins drinking her tea. \n",
      "SOKKA: [To Zuko.] Hey, I remember her! [Cut to frontal view of Zuko, Sokka standing behind.] She helped you attack us! \n",
      "ZUKO: Yup. [Walks forward.] Back in the good old days. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to wide shot as they all walk up to June. \n",
      "JUNE: Oh great. It's Prince Pouty. [Close-up.] Where's your creepy grandpa? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Frontal view of Katara and Zuko.] He's my uncle. And he's not here. \n",
      "JUNE: [Close-up.] I see you worked things out with your girlfriend. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Zuko and Katara who become flustered and embarrassed, looking at each other as they speak, before cutting to June. \n",
      "KATARA: [Angrily.] I'm not his girlfriend! \n",
      "ZUKO: [Speaking at the same time.] She's not my girlfriend! \n",
      "JUNE: [Frontal view.] Okay, okay. Sheesh. I was only teasing. So what do you want? \n",
      "ZUKO: [Frontal view of June with Zuko and Suki behind.] I need your help finding the Avatar. \n",
      "JUNE: Hm. Doesn't sound too fun. [Sips her tea.] \n",
      "ZUKO: [Angrily; leans closer, while clenching his fists.] Does the end of the world sound like more fun? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to side-view of Appa and Nyla growling at each other. Appa licks Nyla, and they lay down. They both stand up as the gang and June walking toward them. Cut to frontal view of the approaching group as June holds up a piece of meat. \n",
      "JUNE: [Shaking the piece of meat.] Nyla. [She throws the meat to Nyla. Cut to frontal view of Nyla, who catches it in his mouth and starts chewing it before swallowing it; June walks up to him and starts petting him.] Who's my little, hmm, Snuffly-Wuffly? [Nyla sticks his toxins-coated tongue out and she dodges it and forces his mouth closed.] Whoa! Careful there. [To Team Avatar.] Okay. So who's got something with the Avatar's scent on it? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Katara standing on Appa's back. \n",
      "KATARA: [Pulls out Aang's glider from Appa's saddle.] I have Aang's staff. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Nyla as June approaches and holds the staff out in front of Nyla. He sniffs it. Cut to wide-view of the group as Nyla begins to walk around in circles, trying to sniff the scent out somewhere else. Cut to overhead view. Cut to closer view of the group as Nyla returns to June and continues sniffing. Cut to frontal view as Nyla lies back down and covers his nose. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Frontal view.] Well, what does that mean? \n",
      "JUNE: [Frontal view. Petting Nyla.] Means your friend's gone. \n",
      "TOPH: [Frontal view.] We know he's gone. That's why we're trying to find him. \n",
      "JUNE: [Close-up as June stands up.] No, I mean he's gone gone. [Turns to face everyone else.] He doesn't exist. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to the others as the look on with worry and confusion. The camera cuts to a mysterious island. Cut inside the forestry as Momo is chasing a squirrel creature in a tree. Camera pans across the branch as Momo chases the squirrel and Aang is seen walking around. \n",
      "AANG: Where are we, Momo? [Cut to view of the sky through the trees as dragonflies fly past. The camera pans down as Aang speaks.] Maybe I'm in the Spirit World? [Cut to frontal view of Aang stepping under a branch.] But wait. You can see me. [Momo approaches on the branch. Cut to a close-up of Momo.] We could both be in the Spirit World. [Cut back to Aang. He uses airbending and the camera pans across as he moves.] Nope. My bending works. [Momo lands on him. Points to the hilltop. Cut to path up a hill. Camera pans up as Aang talks.] Maybe if we climb to the top of the island, we can figure out where we are. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to close-up of Sokka. \n",
      "SOKKA: [To June.] What do you mean Aang doesn't exist? [Side-view of the group.] Do you mean he's ... you know, dead? \n",
      "JUNE: [Frontal view as she pets Nyla.] Nope. We could find him if he were dead. Wow, it's a real head-scratcher. See ya. [Cut to a wide-view of the group as she starts climbing on top of Nyla.] \n",
      "TOPH: [Sarcastically.] Helpful. Real helpful. \n",
      "ZUKO: [To June.] Wait. I have another idea. [Frontal view.] There's only one other person in this world who can help us face the Fire Lord. I'll be right back with a smell sample. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to close-up of a sandal that Zuko holds up. Camera zooms out quickly to show the members of Team Avatar are holding their noses in disgust, except for Zuko and Toph. Zuko looks embarrassed. \n",
      "SOKKA: You saved your uncle's sweaty sandal? Ugh! [Pinches nose even tighter.] \n",
      "TOPH: [Smiles.] I think it's kind of sweet. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to June as Nyla jumps forward. Cut to side-view of Zuko and Nyla as the latter sniffs the sandal. \n",

      "ZUKO: Hey! Wait up! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: They all quickly get on Appa. Cut to behind Appa as his tail hits the ground he takes off in the same direction.

Fade to frontal view of Nyla running along with Appa close behind before Nyla jumps forward toward the camera. Cut to wide-view of Appa and Nyla approaching the destroyed Outer Wall of Ba Sing Se.

Zuko brings his hands up and jumps forward, bringing his arms down in front of him. He bends a flame in each hand and they emerge. He sends the fire toward Azula. The scene cuts to the side of the fight to show a wall of fire, blue colliding with red, take form. As the wall begins to die, Azula leaps up on a jet of fire and kicks her legs forward, sending a wave of fire from her feet during each of her three spinning kicks.\n",
      "Cut to an overhead shot of the stone pillars. Aang lands on top of one, but suddenly leaps away to be blocking and pushed by a blast of fire emerging from Ozai. The Fire Lord attacks again, sending a wave of fire from a downward kick. Aang jumps to another rock to avoid the attack, and picks up a small part of the rock and sends it toward Ozai with a kick. Ozai dodges the attack by sending a blast of fire out of his foot. Aang leaps to the top of another rock to avoid the attack before leaping to land near a waterfall. Ozai follows him there, sending yet another fire blast toward Aang. Aang uses waterbending to send some of the waterfall toward the flames, extinguishing them and causing Ozai to jump back. He flies back toward Aang, using fire rockets from his feet. He shoots a large burst of fire at Aang, but Aang jumps to the top of the waterfall to avoid the attack. Ozai rockets up after him, and flips forward, shooting fire from both feet. Aang jumps to the other side of the slope to escape the hot flames.\n",
      "Ozai flies over to him, using his fire jets shooting from his feet, but Aang lands on a boulder, lifting it into the air. He jumps away, only to stop Ozai for a second, distracted by the boulder. He continues to chase Aang, shooting at him with his fiery fist. Aang spins around, creating a tornado shield that blocks him from the flames. He lands on the side of a rock pillar, and quickly scoots to the other side, only to see Ozai shooting another stream of fire at him. Aang leaps to another pillar before airbending himself back to the first pillar. He kicks the top of the pillar off, sending it toward Ozai. To Aang's surprise, Ozai is right behind him, and he sends a ball of fire toward Aang.\n",
      "Aang raises his hand to block himself from the surprise attack as he is pushed and hits the side of a rock, falling to the ground in pain. Ozai flies toward him again, and lands on the same ledge as Aang. Seeing that Ozai is there, Aang picks himself up, and suddenly earthbends to create rock armor around his body. Ozai shoots fists of fire at Aang, pushing him around the edge of the ledge. He swings his arm at Aang, sending a wave of fire toward him, but he jumps away leaving the rock armor behind.\n",
      "Aang suddenly performs a flip backward to shoot a gust of wind at Ozai from the air. Ozai jumps aside to avoid Aang's blast, and begins to shoot lightning. Aang is grasping on to the side of a rock, seemingly terrified. Just when the lightning is about to strike him, he quickly swings his arm around to create another tornado shield. He jumps up, and flies to the top of a rock where Ozai attempts to shoot a lightning bolt at him, but misses. After the failed attempt, he continues shooting blasts at Aang, to which he lifts the top of a rock and dodges in order to evade. He suddenly rolls forward, just as Ozai sends another blast of lightning toward him.\n",
      "Aang begins to redirect the lightning, pointing it toward the terrified Ozai. Aang hesitates to strike him, and so he sends the bolt into the orange sky instead. He falls to the ground, exhausted from straining to hold the energy from the lightning. Ozai smiles, sensing he has the upper-hand, and performs a spin-kick of fire toward Aang, who raises the ground to protect himself from the fire blast. He is thrown off the rock from the impact and is falling toward the water below him. The camera zooms in on his eye as he opens it and realizes he is falling.\n",
      "He tilts himself up, frantically waving his arms and trying to airbend to break his fall. Seeing that does not work due to the speed he is falling, as he nears the water, he creates a funnel shape from it to land softly and gets washed up onto shore. He quickly stands up to see Ozai rocketing toward him. Cut to a shot of Ozai. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene cuts back to Zuko and Azula. Cut to an overhead shot of the plaza, orange and blue flames blasting toward each other. One building is shown to be on fire, and as a bright blue flame shoots past the camera, another one burns in the flames. Cut to a shot of Zuko as he punches a powerful blast of fire toward his sister. His stream of orange blends with a blast of blue fire. Cut to a shot of the side of Zuko, he continues shooting fire while being pushed back by the blue flames colliding with his. The camera zooms in on Zuko's foot as he continues to be pushed back. He turns his foot around in order to steady himself. Cut to a frontal shot of Zuko, a powerful fire blast streaming from his fist.\n",
      "Suddenly, Zuko and Azula stop their attacks. The scared and confused Azula turns to find that Zuko's strong attack has caused the plaza behind her to be smothered in flames. She leaps forward with a blast of fire that she swings at Zuko. Just as he is about to be hit, Zuko thrusts his palms outward to create a wall of fire that slices the blue flame. The scene cuts to an overhead shot of the flames as they slowly die down. Cut to a shot of Azula who is crouching on the ground. A profile shot of her shows that she is heavily panting, and she grits her teeth and narrows her eyes in determination.\n",
      "A determined look flushes over Azula. The scene quickly cuts to a shot of Zuko's left fist. He opens it, and with the other fist punches two large fireballs toward Azula, and the fire emerges to create one massive blast. Cut to a shot of Azula's fear-filled eyes, reflecting with orange from the oncoming attack. The camera zooms out as Azula dodges using a jet of blue fire. She flies forward into the air, using jets of fire from her feet and hands. Cut to a side-shot of her as she thrusts her fists forward creating two blue fire blasts.\n",
      "Zuko is shown crouching with his arms outward, blue and orange flames swirling around him. Azula is flying toward him as she swerves to the right to dodge Zuko's last blast. The scene cuts to an overhead shot of Azula as she shoots fire at Zuko and circles him, a trail of blue fire coming from her feet. Zuko quickly defends himself by creating a shield of fire for protection. He tries to attack Azula, who is still circling him, but she is too fast. The scene cuts to a close shot of Zuko. He stops firing at Azula, crouches, and begins spinning and kicking immense and powerful flames from his feet. Azula is flying forward; when she sees the attack, she tries to stop, but it is too late. Azula falls and rolls forward onto the ground. In pain, she picks herself up. A close-up of her shows that she is hunched over, her hair is undone and she is extremely angry. \n",
      "ZUKO: [Angrily and somewhat mockingly.] No lightning today? What's the matter? [Quickly assuming his lightning redirection stance.] Afraid I'll redirect it? \n",
      "AZULA: Oh, I'll show you lightning! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: At that moment, Azula waves and moves her fingertips in order to generate lightning, but her stance is irregular and off. The scene cuts to a frontal shot of Zuko; inhaling and exhaling deeply. He assumes his stance and prepares to redirect whatever lightning may come his way. As he is doing so, the camera pans left to show Katara standing by as backup. Suddenly, light begins flickering as Azula begins charging her lightning. She finishes charging, and a close-up of her eyes shows she is not glancing toward Zuko, but to the left of him. The scene cuts to Zuko with Katara to his left and zooms in on Katara. Cut back to Azula, still in her stance and ready to strike; lightning at her fingertips. She smiles and extends her arm to shoot the blast directly at Katara.\n",
      "The scene becomes some-what slow motion as lightning is emerging from Azula. Cut to a shot of Zuko's shocked face as he turns to the left. Zuko runs, trying to get in between Katara and the lightning. The scene zooms in on Katara's dumbfounded face and cuts to a close-up on her eyes, reflecting the impending lightning. Suddenly, Zuko jumps up, in between Katara and the lightning. \n",
      "ZUKO: [In slow motion as he comes in front of Katara.] No! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko extends his finger out in order to redirect it, but fails in doing so, therefore absorbing it. Light flashes, and the camera cuts to a shot from behind Katara, showing Zuko in mid-air, before cutting to Katara's shocked, horrified face. The slow motion ends, and Zuko hits the ground, the lightning leaving his body through his other arm. Cut to a shot above the capital, the redirected lightning blasting into the air. Cut back to Zuko, lying on the ground, twitching from the electricity seeping through his body. He rolls onto his back, groaning and holding his wounded chest. Cut to a scared Katara as she runs in Zuko's direction. \n",
      "KATARA: [Yelling.] Zuko! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko is shown, lying on the ground in pain. His shirt around his chest is burnt away, revealing a large scar. Katara is running toward him, but is stopped in her tracks by a blast of lightning in between her and Zuko. The scene cuts to a crazed Azula, hunched over and swaying from side to side. She suddenly starts laughing maniacally and runs forward into the camera just as the scene cuts to Ozai rocketing forward.\n",
      "The shot cuts to the side of Ozai as he flies over the water below. The terrified Aang begins to swing his arms using waterbending to launch. He reaches the shore, stumbling forward, with Ozai not too far behind. Ozai reaches him, and Aang earthbends a circle of rocks around himself for protection. Ozai is right over him, laughing. The scene cuts to Aang trapped inside his sphere, bracing himself with his arms. \n",
      "OZAI: You're weak, just like the rest of your people! They did not deserve to exist in this world ... in my world! Prepare to join them. Prepare to die! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The camera tilts up to show Ozai thrusting both fists into Aang's rock shield, releasing a powerful fire blast while doing so. Cut to Aang still trapped inside the rock, still shielding himself with his eyes closed as pebbles fall around him and orange light can be seen seeping in through the cracks between the rocks. Cut back to Ozai as he throws another fire blast against Aang's shield. Ozai jumps back, lands, and rises back up to the camera's level as the scene zooms in on him. It quickly zooms out as he sends two powerful fire blasts at the camera. Fade to credits. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The episode opens with a reddish sky due to Sozin's Comet as the camera pans to the left. The scene cuts to Ozai throwing a left-curved fire blast, followed with a right-curved blast. He fires a straight blast. Cuts to inside Aang's earth sphere shield as he endures the blasts. \n",

      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to the airship fleet. Sokka and Toph are running on top of one of three airships. \n",
      "SOKKA: Toph, metalbend the rudder so it's jammed in a turning position. The ship will spiral and slam into the others. \n",
      "TOPH: Got it! [She moves Sokka out of the way, spits into her hands, and rubs them together. Toph grips and metalbends the rudder while grunting in effort, and the Imperial Firebenders inside the ship crash into the wall, and due to the action, the ship crashes into the others.] \n",
      "SOKKA: Have I ever mentioned how sweet it is that you invented metalbending? \n",
      "TOPH: [Pleased.] You could stand to mention it more. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: A firebender comes out of the ship and fires at Sokka and Toph. Dragging Toph along, Sokka jumps off the ship, planting his sword in the side of vessel the stop their descent. He manages to slow them down, though they still fall off and roughly land on a platform below; Sokka breaks his leg in the process, and his sword embeds itself in the metal just in front of him. Toph, however, falls off the platform, though Sokka manages to grab hold of her hand at the last moment. \n",
      "SOKKA: [In pain.] My leg! Hang on Toph! \n",
      "TOPH: Aye, aye, Captain. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Two firebenders emerge on the platforms beside them, posing a threat from two sides. As one of the soldiers is about to firebend at them, Sokka throws his boomerang at him, knocking him out. He kicks his sword in to his hand and throws it at the remaining soldier's platform; it cuts right through the metal and plummets to the forest below. \n",
      "SOKKA: [Sadly.] Bye, space sword. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: More Imperial Firebenders come outside, ready to finish the pair. \n",
      "SOKKA: I don't think boomerang's coming back, Toph. It looks like this is the end. [Toph starts crying and the firebenders run away. The airship gets struck by a different one and Sokka lets Toph fall onto it before jumping down himself, hurting his leg again in the process. He falls over in pain.] \n",
      "TOPH: How did that happen? Did boomerang come back? \n",
      "SOKKA: [Looking up.] No, Suki did. [They see Suki riding on the last functioning airship with a triumphant smile.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The scene changes to Aang and Ozai's battle. Ozai is still throwing fire blasts at Aang. He blasts Aang a few more times and rises up to fly toward the shell to shoot an enormous, continuous blast of fire at Aang. Ozai steps back to charge another intense attack causing Aang's rock shield to be crushed and Aang protects himself with an airbending shield but is pushed back by the force of the attack, crashing into a rock pillar. The scar on his back is hit with a point of the rock, causing him to flashback to when he was shot by lightning. Cut to him during the Avatar State as Roku explains how the ability works. Cut to Kyoshi as the camera pans across revealing more Avatars, all with their eyes lit up. Cut briefly to Roku, before cutting back to the Avatar line.

      "OZAI: Come on out, little boy. You're about to be ... \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang jumps out, now in the Avatar State, and grabs Ozai by his goatee. Ozai tries to firebend at the Avatar, but Aang merely knocks his hand away. He creates a blast of air sending Ozai flying backward. Cut briefly to an over the shoulder of Aang view of Ozai being forced away, crashing into a pillar of rock. He falls down to the ground and as the dust clears he looks up at Aang in the sky with a sphere of air around him. Aang proceeds to roar and creates fire out of his mouth, fists and feet. Aang creates a massive gust of air causing Ozai to cover himself as he groans in struggle. Pillars of earth disintegrate and move toward Aang as other pieces of rock rise up from the ground to surround Aang. Water also rises toward Aang as he creates a ring of fire around himself. The earth begins to create a ring inside the air sphere as the water continues to rise up and form another ring inside the earth sphere. Cut to Ozai who watches, covering his head with his arms. Cut back to Aang as the camera zooms out to show him surrounded by a ring of water, a ring of earth, a sphere of air and a ring of fire.\n",
      "The scene changes to the liberation of Ba Sing Se as Bumi rises out of the ground with earthbending. He turns around as Fire Nation tanks appear and fire on him, but he blocks it with earthbending. He lowers the barrier smiling. He shoots rocks at the holes where they shoot fire. He subsequently uses earthbending to shoot them into the air and they land piled on top of one another while the soldiers come out the tank groaning in pain. Cut to Iroh as he burns the Fire Nation flag on Ba Sing Se Royal Palace to reveal the Earth Kingdom insignia.\n",
      "The scene changes to Aang and Ozai. Aang charges at Ozai, ramming him, and blows him off his Elemental Sphere. Ozai flies away from Aang. Aang uses earthbending to shoot machine gun-like earth bullets at him. Aang chases a fleeing Ozai.\n",
      "The scene changes to the Comet-Enhanced Agni Kai. A few small flames can be seen, and in the middle of them is a badly injured Zuko. He tries to get up, but he is too hurt from the lighting strike and he falls down. Katara rushes to try and help him, but Azula launches a fire blast in front of her before she can reach him. She laughs manically and shoots lightning which Katara dodges. Zuko attempts to get back up, but is too weak and can do nothing but watch as Azula shoots another lightning bolt at Katara, which she dodges. Katara turns to watch as Azula lands on a roof nearby. She begins charging another lightning attack. \n",
      "AZULA: I'd really rather our family physician look after Little Zuzu if you don't mind. [Azula shoots lightning and fire at her from the roof of a building. Katara manages to dodge them all and hides behind a column nearby. To Zuko in a taunting manner.] Zuzu, you don't look so good! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She shoots at Katara again. Katara manages to dodge her and moves behind another column. She spots water nearby and bends it onto the roof, but Azula has moved. Azula comes from behind her on fire jets and Katara is forced to flee. She uses the nearby water channel to make ice to slide on as Azula chases after her and fires another blast of fire which vaporizes it completely. Azula unleashes a large burst of fire, but Katara manages to get away. Katara gets off her ice path, but trips on a grate and sees some water below. She looks up and grabs some chains hanging from the wall. Cut to a wide-view of the area as Azula approaches the grates. \n",
      "AZULA: There you are, filthy peasant! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: After a brief stare down, Katara uses multiple water whips to force Azula onto the grate. Azula is about to shoot lightning at her when Katara freezes them both with the water under the grate. Katara melts the water around her and chains Azula's hands together tied to the grate. Katara bends the water back into the grate. After catching her breath, she tightens the chains to make sure Azula cannot get free and rushes to heal Zuko. Cut to Katara as she rolls Zuko on to his back and begins healing him. Zuko opens his eyes, feeling the pain lessen, and smiles weakly at Katara, who smiles back as a she sheds a tear. \n",
      "ZUKO: Thank you, Katara. \n",
      "KATARA: I think I'm the one who should be thanking you. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: She helps him up. Azula pants in anger, screams in madness, and breathes fire, writhing in an attempt to break free. Finally she stops and begins to cry uncontrollably. Katara and Zuko watch in horror and pity.\n",
      "The scene changes to Avatar Aang and Phoenix King Ozai. Aang still chases Ozai and uses earthbending to move two pillars in front of Ozai, who recoils and flies away. Aang sends a wave of water at Ozai, causing him to crash to the ground. As Ozai recovers and looks up, Aang bursts through the pillar he landed near. Ozai retreats backward and shoots a stream of fire at Aang. In slow motion, Aang drops to the ground narrowly missing Ozai who propels himself away with fire from his feet. Aang rises and begins following the fleeing Ozai again. Ozai lands on a pillar and launches a wide fire blast at Aang, who uses earthbending to move two large pillars to protect himself. Aang breaks and lets the pillars fall as Ozai flies away again. Aang unleashes multiple blasts of fire toward Ozai, who manages to dodge them. Ozai lands on the side of a pillar and launchers three similar fire blasts at an approaching Aang, who uses air and water to disperse them. Aang fires a strong blast of air at Ozai, disintegrating the pillar he stood on but he manages to get away. Aang continues to chase him as Ozai looks back, realizing Aang is catching up. Aang moves his arm in a circular motion causing water to wrap itself around Ozai's leg and up to his outstretched arm, whipping him around, before slamming him on top of a pillar. Aang flies forward and earthbends Ozai's hands and feet to the ground, trapping him. Helpless, Ozai watches fearfully as Aang hovers over him, his voice echoing with the fury of his predecessors. \n",
      "AANG: Fire Lord Ozai, you and your forefathers have devastated the balance of this world, and now you shall pay the ultimate price! [Aang, under control of his past lives, combines all four elements together for his final attack. At the last second, however, he manages to regain control; he comes out of the Avatar State, lets his attack die out, and floats to the ground, freeing Ozai in the process.] No, I'm not gonna end it like this. \n",
      "OZAI: Even with all the power in the world, you are still weak! \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Ozai moves to attack Aang who senses it with the seismic sense he learned from Toph. He stamps down and lifts a foot up, dragging a pillar of earth along with him, deflecting Ozai's attack and binding him inside the rock. He circles Ozai and proceeds to bind his other hand as Ozai attempts to attack again. He pulls the rocks down into the earth slightly, causing Ozai to kneel. Ozai attempts one final fire breath attack, but Aang uses airbending to stop and approach him and puts one hand on Ozai's forehead, and one on his chest, while he watches in horror.\n",
      "Aang closes his eyes and it flashes back to Aang's meeting with the lion turtle. \n",
      "LION.TURTLE: In the era before the Avatar, we bent not the elements but the energy within ourselves. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: The lion turtle places his paw in a similar position to Aang's hands on Ozai using its claws. The claws begin to glow green light as the camera cuts to a close-up of the lion turtle's eye before fading to Aang. Aang's head arches back and blue energy shines out of his eyes and mouth into the sky. Cut to a side-view of the event before cutting to a close-up of Ozai's terrified face as his eyes and mouth begin to shine out red energy. Aang's, followed by Ozai's, bodies become consumed by the blue and red energies. Cut to a wide-view of the area showing half blue and half red energy in the sky. \n",
      "LION.TURTLE: [Aang remembering.] To bend another's energy, your own spirit must be unbendable or you will be corrupted and destroyed. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: As he speaks, Ozai's energy begins to make its way to Aang's body, consuming the blue and replacing it with red energy. Cut to a view above Aang looking down at his face as the energy reaches his face and continues to cover the beams shining out his mouth and eyes. Cut to a side-view as the red light begins to take control and the blue light diminishes. Cut to close-up of Aang as the red energy has taken over almost completely with just one eye left. The blue energy begins to disappear, but at the last second it blasts out of Aang's eyes, overwhelming the red energy in the process and proceeding to take over Ozai's own body. Cut to a wide shot of the area as Aang completely takes over Ozai's energy and an intense beam of blue energy erupts into the sky. The beam disappears and Ozai falls to the ground as Aang releases him. Ozai attempts to rise and attack, but falls back exhausted and unable to bend. \n",
      "OZAI: [Out of breath.] What? What did you do to me? \n",

      "AANG: I learned there was another way to defeat him and restore balance. I took his bending away. \n",

[Panning front view of Zuko and Aang, as seen from the crowd's perspective.] The road ahead of us is challenging. A hundred years of fighting has left the world scarred and divided. [Cut to side shot of Aang, rotating around, as he turns to see Zuko smile at him, before turning back to the crowd.] But with the Avatar's help, we can get it back on the right path and begin a new era of love and peace. \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Zuko kneels down, preparing to be crowned Fire Lord. Cut to a Fire Sage approaching with the headpiece. \n",
      "FIRE.SAGE: [Puts the Fire Lord headpiece into Zuko's top knot.] All hail Fire Lord Zuko! [Everyone cheers again. Zuko rises.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Cut to Zuko walking toward the cheering crowd, gesturing Aang to follow him. Aang approaches and they look briefly at each other before looking out at the crowd. Cut to Zuko walking to the Fire Nation Prison Tower. Cuts to inside as he enters Ozai's cell. \n",
      "OZAI: [Sarcastically.] I should count myself lucky. The new Fire Lord has graced me with his presence in my lowly prison cell. \n",
      "ZUKO: You should count yourself lucky that the Avatar spared your life. \n",
      "OZAI: Hmph. \n",
      "ZUKO: Banishing me was the best thing you could have done for my life. It put me on the right path. Perhaps your time in here could do the same for you. \n",
      "OZAI: Why are you really here? \n",
      "ZUKO: Because you're going to tell me something. [Bends closer to Ozai; gravely.] Where is my mother? \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: In Ba Sing Se, kids are now using the stacked Fire Nation tanks as a game. Cut to the Jasmine Dragon, Appa looking in from the outside. Cut inside as Zuko is serving Team Avatar tea and Iroh is playing the tsungi horn. Aang is playing with Momo. Sokka is painting a picture. \n",
      "SOKKA: Zuko, stop moving! I'm trying to capture the moment. I wanted to do a painting, so we always remember the good times together. \n",
      "KATARA: That's very thoughtful of you, Sokka. [Suddenly looks annoyed. Cuts to Sokka's painting, which is very unlike the group.] Wait, why did you give me Momo's ears? \n",
      "SOKKA: Those are your hair loopies! \n",
      "ZUKO: At least you don't look like a boar-q-pine! My hair is not that spiky! \n",
      "MAI: I look like a man. \n",
      "SUKI: And why did you paint me firebending? \n",
      "SOKKA: I thought it looked more exciting that way. [Momo jumps on to the table and chitters.] Oh, you think you can do a better job, Momo? [Momo chitters again as Aang goes outside.] \n",
      "IROH: [Points at painting.] Hey, my belly's not that big anymore. I've really trimmed down. \n",
      "TOPH: Well I think you all look perfect! [They laugh.] \n",
      "SCENE.DESCRIPTION: Aang walks past Appa, petting him briefly, before he moves to watch the sun set. Katara approaches from behind with a smile on her face and turns to Aang. Aang turns to look at her and he smiles back. Cut to close-up of Katara smiling and blushing. She places a hand on his shoulder and they hug. Cut to close-up view of Aang before cutting to Katara as they smile and open their eyes. They step out of the embrace and look out at the sun set as the camera pans back, but cuts back to Katara turning to face Aang. Aang turns to face her and Katara passionately kisses Aang, who returns it and they embrace each other as they kiss. Cut to a shot of them still kissing with the sun on the horizon and Ba Sing Se in the background as the camera pans up to the sky. The words \"The End\" fade in. Fade to credits. \n"
